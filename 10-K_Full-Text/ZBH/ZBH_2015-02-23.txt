Cautionary Note About Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “may,” “will,” “can,” “should,” “would,”
“could,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “plan,” “seek,” “believe,” “predict,” “estimate,” “potential,” “project,” “assume,” “guide,”
“target,” “forecast,” “intend,” “strategy,” “is confident that,” “future,” “opportunity,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and
assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ
materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part I, Item 1A of this report). Readers of this report are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. While we believe the assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, there can be no assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update
or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current
Reports on Form 8-K.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

We are a global leader in the
design, development, manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive, spinal and trauma devices, biologics, dental implants and related surgical products. We also provide other healthcare related services. In this report, “Zimmer,”
“we,” “us,” “our” and similar words refer collectively to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

Zimmer Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our history dates to 1927, when Zimmer Manufacturing Company, a predecessor, was
founded in Warsaw, Indiana. On August 6, 2001, Zimmer Holdings was spun off from its former parent and became an independent public company.

On April 24, 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement to merge with LVB Acquisition, Inc. (LVB), the parent company of Biomet, Inc. (Biomet), in a cash and stock transaction valued at
approximately $13.35 billion. We will pay $10.35 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and issue 32.7 million shares of our common stock. In connection with the Biomet merger, we will pay off all of LVB’s outstanding funded
debt, and the aggregate cash merger consideration will be reduced by such amount. The Biomet merger, which is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. The merger will
position the combined company as a leader in the $45 billion musculoskeletal industry. The Biomet merger is expected to be a transformational event for us and have significant effects on all aspects of our business. The description of our business
in this report is for Zimmer on a standalone basis and does not address the consequences of the planned Biomet merger.

Customers, Sales and
Marketing

Our
primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, dentists, hospitals, stocking distributors, healthcare dealers and, in their capacity as agents, healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups. These customers
range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists.

We have operations in more than 25
countries and market products in more than 100 countries. We manage our operations through three major geographic segments – the Americas, which is comprised principally of the U.S. and includes other North, Central and South American markets;
Europe, which is comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and African markets; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and includes other Asian and Pacific markets.

We market and sell products through three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, referred to as
direct channel accounts; 2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers; and 3) directly to dental

practices and dental laboratories. With direct channel accounts, inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers. With sales to stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental
practices and dental laboratories, title to product passes upon shipment or upon implantation of the product. Direct channel accounts represented approximately 75 percent of our net sales in 2014. No individual direct channel account, stocking
distributor, healthcare dealer, dental practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2014.

We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock levels are
determined based on a number of factors, including demand, manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels. We also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local
market practices.

We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and support personnel, some of whom are employed or
contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies. We invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses. Sales force
representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons.

In
response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world, our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region. We utilize a global approach to sales force training, marketing and medical education to provide
consistent, high quality service. Additionally, we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, dentists and oral surgeons and the medical procedures they perform.

The following is a summary of our three reportable segments. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information
regarding our segments.

Americas.

The Americas is our largest geographic segment, accounting for
$2,594.2 million, or 56 percent, of 2014 net sales, with the U.S. accounting for 92 percent of net sales in this region. The U.S. sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents, most of whom sell products exclusively
for Zimmer. The sales force in the U.S. receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs.

In this region, we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified
group. Generally, we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products, although members are not obligated to purchase our products. Contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three
years, with extensions as warranted.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

In the Americas, we monitor and rank independent sales agents and our direct sales force
across a range of performance metrics, including the achievement of sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of working capital.

Europe.

The European geographic segment accounted for $1,269.5 million, or 27 percent, of 2014 net sales, with France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom collectively accounting for 68 percent of net sales in the region. This segment also includes other key markets, including Benelux, Nordic, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our sales force in this
segment is comprised of direct sales associates, commissioned agents, independent distributors and sales support personnel. We emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven, established designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced
materials and surfaces. In most European countries, healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government budgets impact healthcare spending, which can affect our sales in this segment.

Asia Pacific.

The Asia Pacific geographic segment accounted for $809.6 million, or 17 percent, of 2014
net sales, with Japan being the largest market within this segment, accounting for 42 percent of the region’s sales. This segment also includes key markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea, China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong
Kong and Malaysia. In Japan and most countries in the Asia Pacific region, we maintain a network of dealers, who act as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the region, and sales associates, who build and maintain relationships with orthopaedic
surgeons, neurosurgeons and dental surgeons in their markets. The knowledge and skills of these sales associates play a critical role in providing service, product information and support to surgeons. We have a research and development center in
Beijing, China, which focuses on products and technologies designed to meet the unique needs of Asian patients and their healthcare providers.

Seasonality

Our business is seasonal in nature to some extent, as many of our products are used in elective procedures, which typically decline during
the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans.

Distribution

We operate
distribution facilities domestically in Southaven, Mississippi; and Carlsbad, California and internationally in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and
various other countries.

We generally ship our orders via expedited courier. We do not consider our backlog of firm orders
to be material to an understanding of our business.

Products

Our products include orthopaedic
reconstructive implants, spinal and trauma devices, biologics, dental implants and related surgical products.

ORTHOPAEDIC RECONSTRUCTIVE
IMPLANTS

Knees

Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an articular surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee replacement surgeries include
first-time, or primary, joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement, repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure. There are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee, which
treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side, or compartment, of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis. Our knee portfolio also includes early intervention and joint preservation products, which seek to
preserve the joint by repairing or regenerating damaged tissues and by treating osteoarthritis.

Hips

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the natural hip.
Hip procedures include first-time, or primary, joint replacement as well as revision procedures. Hip implant procedures involve the use of bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the surrounding bone, or are press-fit into bone,
which means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies.

Research and Development

We have extensive research and
development activities to develop new surgical techniques, materials, biologics and product designs. The research and development teams work closely with our strategic brand marketing function. The rapid commercialization of innovative new
materials, biologics products, implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales growth.

We are broadening our offerings in each of our product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple
areas. Our primary research and development facility is located in Warsaw, Indiana. We have other research and development personnel based in, among other places, Montreal, Canada; Beijing, China; Winterthur, Switzerland; Austin, Texas; Minneapolis,
Minnesota; Carlsbad, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Dover, Ohio; and Parsippany, New Jersey. As of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 1,000 research and development employees worldwide.

We expect to continue to identify innovative technologies, which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses, establishing
technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances.

Government Regulation and Compliance

We are subject to government
regulation in the countries in which we conduct business. In the U.S., numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market. These include, among others, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
regulations issued or promulgated thereunder. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development, manufacture, advertising, promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products, including
medical devices. In addition, the FDA controls the

ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public.

Most of our new products fall into an FDA classification that requires the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to the
FDA. This process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is, substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device. We must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency
claims. Before we can market the new device, we must receive an order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the U.S.

Other devices we develop and market are in a category (class) for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and
Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. The PMA process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it
determines that the data and information in the PMA application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).

All of our devices marketed in the U.S. have been cleared or approved by the FDA, with the exception of some devices which were in
commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976. The FDA has grandfathered these devices, so new FDA submissions are not required.

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and
manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System
regulations among other FDA requirements, such as restrictions on advertising and promotion. The Quality System regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging and servicing of all
finished medical devices intended for human use. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could
require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund payment of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or
misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices.

The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or
restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), administers controls over the import of medical devices
into the U.S. The CBP imposes its own

regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. We are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain U.S.
government agencies, including the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department and the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Treasury Department.

There are also requirements of state, local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among other things,
design and product standards, packaging requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the European Union have
adopted the European Medical Device Directive, which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries. Compliance with the Medical Device Directive and certification to a quality system enable the
manufacturer to place a CE mark on its products. To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to a product, a recognized European Notified Body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements
of the Medical Device Directive. We are subject to inspection by the Notified Bodies for compliance with these requirements.

Further, we are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims and
anti-kickback laws, as well as the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of
Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in
recent years. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare,
Medicaid and Veterans Administration (VA) health programs.

Our operations in foreign countries are subject to the
extraterritorial application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our global operations are also subject to foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act, among others. As part of our global compliance program, we seek to address
anti-corruption risks proactively.

Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal, state, local and foreign
environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the clean-up of properties by pollutants. We do not expect
that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital expenditures or competitive position.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

Competition

The orthopaedics and broader
musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive. In the global markets for reconstructive implants, trauma and related surgical products, our major competitors include: the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Stryker
Corporation, Biomet, and Smith & Nephew plc.

In the Americas geographic segment, we and the DePuy Synthes Companies,
Stryker Corporation, Biomet, and Smith & Nephew, Inc. (a subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc) account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales. There are also many smaller competitors actively engaging
in this market. Some of these smaller competitors have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry.

The
European reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are more fragmented than those markets in the Americas or the Asia Pacific segments. The variety of philosophies held by European surgeons regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has
fostered the existence of many regional European companies, including Aesculap AG (a subsidiary of B. Braun), Limacorporate S.p.A., Waldemar LINK GmbH & Co., KG and Mathys AG, which, in addition to the global competitors, compete with us.
Many hip implants sold in Europe are products developed specifically for the European market. We intend to continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific European needs.

In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products, we compete primarily with the DePuy Synthes Companies, Stryker
Corporation, Smith & Nephew plc and Biomet, as well as regional companies, including Japan Medical Materials Corporation and Japan Medical Dynamic Marketing, Inc. Factors, such as the dealer system and complex regulatory environments, make
it difficult for smaller companies, particularly those that are non-regional, to compete effectively with the market leaders in the more developed healthcare markets in the Asia Pacific region.

In the spinal implant category, we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of Medtronic, Inc., the DePuy Synthes
Companies, Stryker Corporation, Biomet Spine (a subsidiary of Biomet), NuVasive, Inc. and Globus Medical, Inc.

In the dental
implant category, we compete primarily with Nobel Biocare Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG, Dentsply International and Biomet 3i (a subsidiary of Biomet).

Competition within the industry is primarily based on technology, innovation, quality, reputation and customer service. A key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop
new products and improve existing products and technologies.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

We manufacture our products at
various sites. Our significant manufacturing locations include Warsaw, Indiana; Winterthur, Switzerland; Ponce, Puerto Rico; Dover, Ohio; Carlsbad, California; Parsippany, New Jersey; Shannon,

Ireland; and Beijing, China. We also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components.

The manufacturing operations at our facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of
a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality, lead time reduction and capacity optimization. Our continuous improvement efforts are driven by Lean and Six Sigma methodologies. In addition, at
certain of our manufacturing facilities, many of the employees are cross-trained to perform a broad array of operations.

We
generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity. We continually evaluate the potential to

in-source

and out-source production as part of our manufacturing
strategy to provide value to our stakeholders.

We have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and
offset the impact of inflationary costs. We have, for example, employed computer-assisted robots and multi-axis grinders to precision polish medical devices; automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes, including on-machine
inspection and process controls; purchased state-of-the-art equipment; in-sourced core products and processes; and negotiated cost reductions from third-party suppliers.

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw materials and
select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting
from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the
materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary
rights are important to the continued success of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary
rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information. We own or control through licensing
arrangements more than 4,500 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products.

Employees

As of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 10,000 employees worldwide, including approximately 1,000 employees dedicated to research and development. Approximately 5,600 employees are
located within the U.S.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

and approximately 4,400 employees are located outside of the U.S., primarily throughout Europe and in Japan. We have approximately 4,200 employees dedicated to manufacturing our
products worldwide. The Warsaw, Indiana production facility employs approximately 1,800 employees.

Approximately 190
U.S. employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We

have a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC for and on
behalf of Local 2737-15 covering employees at the Dover, Ohio facility, which continues in effect until May 15, 2015.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could
negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business
may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Relating to the Proposed Biomet
Merger and the Combined Company Following the Merger

The following risk factors relate to certain risks and
uncertainties associated with the pending Biomet merger

and the combined company following the merger. The following discussion does not, however, contain all risks and uncertainties that relate to Biomet and its business on a standalone basis, which
additional risks and uncertainties may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the Biomet merger.

There is no assurance when or if the merger will be completed. Any delay in completing the merger may substantially reduce the benefits
that we expect to obtain from the merger.

Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of
conditions. There can be no assurance that we and LVB will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond our control will be satisfied or waived. We and LVB can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement, even
though LVB stockholders have approved the merger, and we and LVB can also terminate the merger agreement under other specified circumstances. If the merger and the integration of the companies’ respective businesses are not completed within the
expected timeframe, such delay may materially and adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the merger and could result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects associated
with uncertainty about the merger.

We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and the integration of
Biomet.

We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of Biomet. There are a
large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll, manufacturing, marketing and employee benefits. While we expect to
incur integration and restructuring costs following completion of the merger in 2015 that are estimated to exceed $400 million in the first two years post-merger, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate
accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. Although we expect that the
realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or
at all.

We and LVB may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger.

Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other conditions, the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the approval of the European Commission and the receipt of approval or expiration or termination of any waiting period under applicable antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
laws of Japan. We and LVB are pursuing all required consents, orders and approvals in accordance with the merger agreement. These consents,



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

orders and approvals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to our or Biomet’s divisions, operations or assets, or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place
restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business. The merger agreement requires us and LVB, among other things, to accept all such conditions, divestitures, requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions that may be imposed by
regulatory entities. Such conditions, divestitures, requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions may jeopardize or delay completion of the merger, may reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger or may result in the abandonment of the merger.
Further, no assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, even if all such consents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions
are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals.

The
pendency of the merger could have an adverse effect on our and/or Biomet’s business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.

The pendency of the merger could disrupt our and/or Biomet’s businesses in the following ways, among others:

•

our and/or Biomet’s employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles in the combined company, which might adversely affect our
and/or Biomet’s ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel;

•

the attention of our and/or Biomet’s management may be directed towards the completion of the merger and other transaction-related considerations
and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of us and/or Biomet, as applicable, and matters related to the merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might
have been beneficial to us and/or Biomet, as applicable; and

•

customers, suppliers and other third parties with business relationships with us and/or Biomet may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to
terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us and/or Biomet as a result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us and/or Biomet or otherwise.

Any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of, or harm the financial condition, results of operations or business
prospects of, us and/or Biomet.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our future business and financial
results.

If the merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected. We will be subject to several
risks, including the following:

•

having to pay certain costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees; and

•

focusing our management on the merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us and our stockholders, without
realizing any of the benefits of having the merger completed.

We cannot assure you that, if the merger is not completed, these risks will not materialize
and will not materially adversely affect our business and financial results.

Successful integration of Biomet with us and
successful operation of the combined company are not assured. Also, integrating our business with that of Biomet may divert the attention of management away from operations.

If the merger is completed, Biomet will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours, but will initially continue its operations on
a basis that is separate from our operations. There can be no assurance that after the merger Biomet will be able to maintain and grow its business and operations. In addition, the market segments in which Biomet operates may experience declines in
demand and/or new competitors. Integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of Biomet with ours will involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. This process will be time-consuming and
expensive, will disrupt the businesses of both companies and may not result in the full benefits expected by us and Biomet, including cost synergies expected to arise from supply chain efficiencies and overlapping general and administrative
functions. The potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, include:

•

managing a larger combined company;

•

consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;

•

issues in integrating manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities, research and development and sales forces;

•

difficulties attracting and retaining key personnel;

•

loss of customers and suppliers and inability to attract new customers and suppliers;

•

unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;

•

incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing, administration and other systems and processes; and

•

unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the merger or Biomet’s business.

Additionally, the integration of our and Biomet’s operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and
other internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could harm the combined company’s business, financial condition and operating results.

We will incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the merger and may not be able to meet all of our debt
obligations.

In connection with the merger, we entered into a $7.66 billion bridge credit agreement and a $4.35 billion
bank credit agreement. Proceeds from the bank credit agreement and the anticipated issuance by us of up to $7.66 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (or, if senior unsecured notes are not issued and sold prior to the
closing date of the merger, drawings under the bridge credit agreement) will be used to finance, in part, the cash consideration for the merger, pay fees and the expenses incurred in connection with the merger and pay off all of



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

Biomet’s funded debt. Our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $1.43 billion and, immediately after the completion of the merger, the combined company’s debt
is anticipated to be approximately $12.09 billion. As of December 31, 2014, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding capital leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months would, in the absence of the
merger, have been approximately $64.0 million. As a result of the increase in debt related to the merger, demands on the combined company’s cash resources will increase after the completion of the merger. The increased level of debt could,
among other things:

•

require the combined company to dedicate a large portion of its cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of its debt, thereby reducing
funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•

limit the combined company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development
expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•

limit the combined company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which we operate;

•

restrict the combined company’s ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;

•

place the combined company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;

•

adversely affect the combined company’s credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing the combined company’s indebtedness might
increase and its ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;

•

adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and

•

limit the combined company’s ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.

If we are unable to obtain alternate financing through senior unsecured notes, it is unlikely that we will
be able to repay the outstanding amounts under the bridge loan at maturity on the 364th day after completion of the merger. Any debt incurred to refinance the bridge loan may be on unfavorable terms.

The merger may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.

Although we anticipate that the merger will have an immediate accretive impact on the combined company’s adjusted
earnings per share, this expectation is based on factors that may not be realized and estimates that may materially change. We could also encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors, such as the failure to realize all of the
benefits anticipated to result from the merger. In addition, we expect that LVB stockholders and holders of LVB equity-based awards immediately prior to the merger will own, in the aggregate, approximately 16% of our outstanding shares after the
merger, based on the number of outstanding shares of our common stock on December 31, 2014. Once

additional shares are issued in the merger, the combined company’s earnings per share may be lower than our adjusted earnings per share would have been in the absence of the merger. All of
these factors could cause dilution to earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger, and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that any increase in adjusted earnings
per share will occur, even over the long term. Any increase in adjusted earnings per share as a result of the merger is likely to require us, among other things, to successfully manage the combined company’s operations to increase our
consolidated earnings after the merger.

Risks Relating to Our Business Regardless of Whether the Proposed Biomet Merger is
Consummated

Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our
competitors.

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or
uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies.
Competition is primarily on the basis of:

•

technology;

•

innovation;

•

quality;

•

reputation; and

•

customer service.

In markets outside of the U.S., other factors influence competition as well, including:

•

local distribution systems;

•

complex regulatory environments; and

•

differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

Our competitors may:

•

have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•

respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•

undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•

adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•

be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.

If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers
may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Our marketing success in the U.S. and abroad
depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’
detailed knowledge of products and instruments. A loss of a significant number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete
over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Demand for our products may
change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:

•

evolving customer needs;

•

changing demographics;

•

slowing industry growth rates;

•

declines in the reconstructive implant market;

•

the introduction of new products and technologies;

•

evolving surgical philosophies; and

•

evolving industry standards.

Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new
product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:

•

properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•

commercialize new products in a timely manner;

•

manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;

•

differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings;

•

achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

•

satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost
procedures;

•

innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and

•

provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:

•

entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•

the need for regulatory clearance; and

•

uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to
fund the production. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they
may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.

If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be
harmed.

We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which
receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors may

deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an
unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices.

In addition,
third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. If third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other
healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

We have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets. If key
participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.

The U.S. healthcare reform law includes provisions that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of
2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act), was signed into law in March 2010 and mandates health insurance coverage and other healthcare reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. As part of the Affordable Care Act, in January 2013
we began paying a 2.3 percent medical device excise tax on the vast majority of our U.S sales. We continue to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the earnings impact due to the tax. We have not been able to pass along the cost
of the tax to hospitals, which continue to face cuts to their Medicare reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act and other legislation. Nor have we been able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion
of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population. The medical device excise tax regulations and subsequent guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury have not lessened the burden of complying with
the excise tax statute. In addition, without the implementation of proper safeguards, the Affordable Care Act’s Medicare payment reforms, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments, could provide additional incentives for
healthcare providers to reduce spending on some of our medical device products and reduce utilization of hospital procedures that use our products. Accordingly, while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the full impact of the
Affordable Care Act on our business, ongoing implementation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs. Group



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing
organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group
purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our
failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

We are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products,
non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The medical
devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be
costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in
substantial additional costs.

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under
FDA regulations. Compliance with the FDA’s requirements, including the Quality System regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is
monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA, which may result in observations on Form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not
in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a
recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such devices, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and
others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical
devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from
effectively marketing and

selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In 2012, we received a warning letter from the FDA citing concerns relating to certain manufacturing and validation processes pertaining
to

Trilogy

Acetabular System products manufactured at our Ponce, Puerto Rico manufacturing facility. As of December 31, 2014, the warning letter remains pending. Until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional
regulatory action by the FDA, the FDA may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the FDA may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Additional information regarding this and other FDA regulatory matters can be found in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements (See Part II, Item 8 of this report).

Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards
Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.

If we fail to comply
with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our industry is subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the
federal Stark law, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S.,
exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration (VA) health programs. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid
change.

We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business
risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.

We sell our products in more than 100 countries
and derived almost 50 percent of our net sales in 2014 from outside the U.S. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with
international sales and operations. Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:

•

changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•

unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

•

differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

•

trade protection measures and import or export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our
operating costs;

•

foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;

•

complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

•

extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

•

effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

labor force instability;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

•

political and economic instability.

Violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.

We may have additional tax liabilities.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business,
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any
related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that
determination is made.

We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of
funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on
foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.

We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to
decline and expose us to counterparty risks.

A substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in Europe and
Japan. The U.S. Dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen, as well as other currencies, could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may
not prove to be fully effective.

Pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our
financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.

Our business exposes us to
potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing
flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. As previously reported, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the

Durom

®

Acetabular Component (

Durom

Cup) and certain products within the

NexGen

Knee System.
The majority of the

Durom

Cup cases are pending in a federal Multidistrict Litigation in the District of New Jersey (

In Re: Zimmer Durom Hip Cup Products Liability Litigation

) and the majority of the

NexGen

Knee System cases are
pending in a federal Multidistrict Litigation in the Northern District of Illinois (

In Re: Zimmer NexGen Knee Implant Products Liability Litigation

). We are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims
related to various other products. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could
have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.

Although we
maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, we have substantial self-insured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement. Furthermore, even if any product
liability loss is covered by our insurance, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits.
Product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in
our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.

Claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our
industry and are frequently time consuming and costly. At any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it
is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future
products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual
property, and we will continue to do so. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Further, our currently
pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid,
unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not
be available on reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect
in some foreign countries. If we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.

We also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation with security measures,
including the use of non-disclosure and other agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.

We are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.

In addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial litigation and
claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and
management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. We could
in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.

We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our information systems and data, our business could be
adversely affected.

We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and
infrastructure. As a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations,

changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our
information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information
technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. In addition, third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access to our products or systems and may obtain data
relating to patients or our proprietary information. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in
determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals, have regulatory sanctions or
penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. While we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information
technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will
be successful or that systems issues will not arise in the future. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating
results.

Our assets include intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisition activity and
represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be
recoverable. If the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our
businesses decline, we could be required, under current U.S. accounting rules, to record a non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment. Any write-off of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would
negatively affect our results of operations.

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials and
outsourced activities.

We use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to manufacture our products and to
outsource some key manufacturing activities. These suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements. Some key raw materials and outsourced activities can only be
obtained from a



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

single source or a limited number of sources. A prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect
our ability to satisfy demand for our products.

The “conflict minerals” rule may adversely affect the sourcing,
availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, may increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and harm our reputation.

We are subject to the SEC’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined
from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. We filed a report on Form SD with the SEC regarding such matters on June 2, 2014 and are required

to file on an annual basis going forward. This rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely
affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. In addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products. We have a
complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. As a result, we may face reputational challenges with our
customers and other stakeholders.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the
rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2013 and 2012 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation.

Forward-looking financial information provided in this management’s discussion and analysis does not include estimated results of
operations, cash flows or financial position related to the pending Biomet merger, except for certain costs and expenses we expect to incur that are necessary to consummate the merger and that we will incur for integration planning prior to the
merger closing. The Biomet merger is expected to be a transformational event for us and have significant effects on all aspects of our business. This management’s discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of
operations on a standalone basis is not indicative of the financial condition and results of operations for future periods on a combined company basis following the merger.

EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW

2014 Results

Our 2014 sales results reflected increased growth as compared
with 2013. Sales from recent product introductions, such as

Persona

The Personalized Knee System, as well as a stable joint replacement market, drove sales volume and product mix growth. This was partially offset by continued pricing
pressure, negative effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and a year-over-year decline in sales of our

Transposal

Fluid Waste Management System.

Despite the increase in net sales, net earnings decreased, driven by increased spending
on our operational excellence initiatives, integration planning expenses related to the pending Biomet merger, a $70.0 million contingent legal liability recognized in 2014, and increased debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees recognized on
new debt facilities that we entered into in May 2014 in order to fund the pending Biomet merger.

2015 Outlook

The pending Biomet merger, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2015, will have a significant impact on our 2015 operating
results. This report does not include guidance for 2015 on a combined company basis.

However, for Zimmer on a standalone
basis, we project that our net sales will face significant headwinds from the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro, Japanese Yen and various other currencies around the world based upon recent foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally
for net sales, we expect to experience volume and mix growth from a stable joint replacement market and continued pricing pressure.

In regards to expenses on a Zimmer standalone basis, due to our hedging program, we project that the expected decrease in net sales caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates will be partially
offset by hedge gains to be recognized in 2015. We expect research and development (R&D) spending will remain similar compared to prior years as a percentage of net sales. For our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, we
expect to continue to realize efficiencies from our operational excellence initiatives. However, since many of our fixed SG&A expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars, such as corporate and business unit headquarter expenses and intangible asset
amortization, our SG&A expenses may not decrease in similar proportion to net sales decreases expected from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The following table presents net sales by product category by region (dollars in

Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends

Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 4 percentage points of year-over-year sales growth in 2014, which
was a lower growth rate than experienced in 2013 compared to 2012. In 2013, accelerated growth was fueled by the introduction of new products, such as

Persona

The Personalized Knee System and the Transposal Fluid Waste Management System. In
2014, while new products continued to drive sales growth, their impact on a year-over-year basis was not as significant.

We
believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles,
among other factors. In addition, demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies.

Pricing Trends

Global
selling prices had a negative effect of 2 percent on year-over-year sales during 2014. The negative 2 percent was

consistent with prior years as we continued to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems. For 2015, we expect
continued pricing pressure similar to prior years.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

For 2014, foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 1 percent decrease in sales, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar
versus the Japanese Yen as well as a few other currencies in other regions in which we operate. If foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with December 31, 2014 rates, we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency
exchange rates will have a greater negative effect on sales in 2015 than in 2014. We address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options
solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in
the near term is expected to be partially offset.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

Sales by Product Category

Knees

Knee sales increased 3 percent in 2014 compared to a 4 percent
increase in 2013. Our Knee product category has benefited from recent product introductions, such as

Persona

The Personalized Knee System and joint preservation solutions. However, the volume/mix growth from new product introductions has been
tempered by pricing pressure in all our reporting segments.

In 2014, we continued a broader launch of

Persona

The
Personalized Knee System. We intend to continue to deploy implant and instrument sets for this knee system to all geographic regions in 2015 and beyond. Our

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution product line is still our leading global knee system in
terms of sales. Products driving growth in this category, in addition to

Persona

The Personalized Knee System, included the

Zimmer

Unicompartmental High Flex Knee and our joint preservation solutions.

In Europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected Knee sales in 2014 and 2013 by negative 1 percent and positive 2 percent,
respectively. In Asia Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects on Knee sales of 5 percent and 9 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Hips

Hip sales were flat in 2014 after a decline of 1 percent in 2013.
Positive volume and mix trends continue to be offset by pricing pressure.

Leading hip stem sales were the

Zimmer

M/L
Taper Hip Prosthesis, the

Zimmer

Kinectiv

Technology, the

CLS Spotorno

Stem from the

CLS

,

the

Alloclassic Zweymüller

Hip Stem and the

Hip Stem, the

Continuum

Acetabular System, the

Trilogy

IT Acetabular System, the

Allofit

IT

Alloclassic

Acetabular System,

Vivacit-E

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners and

BIOLOX delta

Heads.

In Europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected Hip sales in 2014 and 2013 by negative 1 percent and positive 2 percent,
respectively. In Asia Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects on Hip sales of 6 percent and 11 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Extremities

Extremities sales increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to
an 11 percent increase in 2013. The sales increase in both years reflected growth from our shoulder systems, such as the

Zimmer Trabecular Metal

Reverse Shoulder System and the

Sidus

Stem-Free Shoulder, and a broader product portfolio to compete in the foot and ankle and hand and wrist areas of the Extremities category. The broader portfolio includes the

Zimmer Trabecular Metal

Total Ankle and products from the acquisition of NORMED Medizin-Technik GmbH in June 2013.

Dental

Dental sales increased 1 percent in 2014, which was the same as the prior year sales growth. Increased sales of dental reconstructive
implants and digital solutions have been partially offset by decreases in restorative products. Sales were led by the

Tapered Screw-Vent

Implant System. In our Dental product category, in certain markets, especially in our Asia Pacific
region, our customers are distributors. The timing of distributor purchases can have a significant influence on sales in those markets in any particular year.

Trauma

Trauma sales were flat in 2014 and increased by 2 percent in 2013.
New product launches, especially in our Europe and Asia Pacific reporting segments, positively affected sales in both years. The

Zimmer Natural Nail

System and

Zimmer

Periarticular Locking Plates System led Trauma sales.

Spine

Spine sales increased 2 percent in 2014 after a decline of 3 percent in 2013. In 2014, we continued to focus on and had success in commercializing offerings across our core fusion portfolio and market
adjacencies, including minimally invasive surgeries. Solid sales of the

PathFinder NXT

Minimally Invasive Pedicle Screw System and

Trabecular Metal

Technology products were partially offset by a decline in sales of other
spine products.

Surgical and other

Surgical and other sales declined by 5 percent in 2014 after an 18 percent sales increase in 2013. The primary cause of the sales fluctuations in this product category was the

Transposal

Fluid
Waste Management System. This system is comprised of a capital equipment component that is used with a one-time use disposable manifold component. In 2013, our system benefitted from commercial disruption experienced by a competitive product,
increasing demand for the capital equipment component. With that competitive product back on the market in 2014 and since many customers bought our capital equipment component in 2013, sales of the capital equipment component decreased significantly
in 2014. However, this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of the related disposable manifold component. Other products leading sales in this category were

PALACOS

Bone Cement, tourniquets and wound debridement devices.

Expenses as a Percent of Net Sales

Cost of Products Sold

The following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2014 and 2013 compared to the prior year:

The increase in gross margin percentage in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to significant excess
and obsolete inventory charges recorded in 2013 related to products we intend to discontinue. We also recognized higher hedge gains in 2014 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2013. Under the hedging program, for

derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of
products sold when the hedged items affect earnings. Further, we experienced improved product category mix, resulting in lower average costs per unit sold. These favorable items were partially offset by lower average selling prices and the U.S.
medical device excise tax. While we began paying the medical device excise tax in 2013, based upon the levels of inventory we were carrying before the excise tax was effective on January 1, 2013, we did not recognize any significant expenses
from the excise tax until the fourth quarter of 2013. We are in discussions with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as to what an appropriate constructive sales price used to compute our excise tax obligations should be under IRS excise tax
regulations and our specific business model. Our ultimate medical device excise tax and liability may differ from the amount we have estimated. Accordingly, the amount we have recognized as expense is an estimate and subject to change.

The decrease in gross margin in 2013 was primarily due to higher average costs per unit sold as a result of changes in product and
geographic mix and increased excess and obsolescence charges related to products we intend to discontinue. Additionally, lower average selling prices and certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and
remediation efforts reduced gross margin. These negative effects were partially offset by hedge gains recorded in 2013 from our foreign currency hedging program versus hedge losses recorded in 2012.

Operating Expenses

R&D expenses and R&D as a percentage of sales have declined in the last three years. The lower spending reflected a natural decline from certain large projects that achieved commercialization,
including

Persona

The Personalized Knee System, and a dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives. We expect R&D spending in 2015 to increase and be between 4 and 4.5 percent of sales as we transition our
resources towards new projects as our quality and operational excellence initiatives continue to progress.

SG&A expenses
have remained relatively consistent while SG&A as a percentage of sales has decreased over the last three years. Improvement in SG&A expenditures as a percentage of sales reflects the effects of our operational excellence initiatives.
Although variable expenses naturally increase with higher sales, our SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales has decreased due to our operational excellence initiatives which produced lower variable and fixed costs in SG&A as net sales
increased. Additionally, selling and distribution expenses are lower in our Europe and Asia Pacific reporting segments compared to our Americas reporting segment. The mix of revenues with high sales growth in Europe and Asia Pacific compared to the
Americas helped to lower SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2014 when compared to 2013.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

“Certain claims” expense is for estimated liabilities to

Durom

Cup
patients undergoing revision surgeries. We recorded additional expense of $21.5 million in 2014, bringing the total recorded expense to $420.3 million for these claims, excluding a subset of

Durom

Cup claims that were recorded in SG&A.
The additional expense recorded in 2014 was the result of new developments related to international claims activity. For more information regarding these claims, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.

In connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2012, we noted that the carrying values of the
net assets of our U.S. Spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $96.0 million in 2012. We did not record a goodwill impairment charge in 2014 or
2013, as our annual goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying values of the net assets of our U.S. Spine reporting unit were less than their estimated fair value. For more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led
to the 2012 impairment, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

“Special items” have increased
significantly in the past three years. The increase in 2014 was a result of higher professional fees related to the pending Biomet merger, increased other professional fees, contract labor and dedicated project personnel related to our quality and
operational excellence initiatives, increased intangible asset impairments and a $70.0 million accrual for a certain litigation matter. We continue to implement our quality and operational excellence initiatives, which are intended to improve our
future operating results by centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality, distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and our information technology systems. “Special items” expenses include consulting and professional
fees, dedicated personnel costs, severance benefits as well as other costs for those programs. In addition to expenses for our quality and operational excellence programs, we recognize expenses related to integration of acquired businesses,
impairment of assets, certain R&D agreements, certain litigation settlements, contract termination expenses and other items as “Special items.” See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding
“Special items” charges.

Other Expense, Interest Income, Interest Expense, and Income Taxes

Other expense represents debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees recognized for our senior credit facility and bridge credit
agreement that we entered into in May 2014 in order to fund the pending Biomet merger.

Interest income and expense, net, was
lower in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012. In the second half of 2013, we entered into additional fixed-to-variable rate interest swaps designated as fair value hedges. In the 2014 periods, the variable rates we paid on the swaps were lower than the
fixed rate on the hedged debt and, therefore, interest expense decreased.

Our effective tax rate (ETR) on earnings before income taxes for the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 23.8 percent, 22.6 percent and 24.0 percent, respectively. The variation of our ETR has largely been affected by “Special items”, “Certain claims”, goodwill impairment charges and a $34.3
million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a legal entity restructuring. Higher “Special items” and “Certain claims” expense favorably affect our ETR because most of these expenses have been
incurred within jurisdictions with higher tax rates, resulting in lower taxable income in these higher tax jurisdictions. Goodwill impairment negatively affects our ETR because no tax benefit is recorded on the charge. In 2014, a portion of our
“Special items” were for non-deductible expenses incurred related to the pending Biomet merger, which increased our ETR relative to 2013. In 2013, in addition to the effect of “Special items” and “Certain claims”, our
ETR benefited from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and other tax benefits applicable to us that applied to 2012 and 2013. Due to the timing of the extension and the applicable rules of accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (GAAP), we recognized the 2012 benefit in 2013. Despite the $34.3 million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a legal entity restructuring, the 2012 ETR was higher than 2014 and 2013
due to the goodwill impairment charge and lower “Certain claims” and “Special items” expenses. The items discussed accounted for the majority of the variation in our ETRs in the past three years.

Segment Operating Profit

For our reporting segments, operating profit increased in Europe and Asia Pacific in 2014 compared to 2013, while in the Americas it decreased. The decrease in the Americas was primarily from lower gross
profit due to lower sales and the effect of the U.S. medical device excise tax. In Europe, the increase in operating profit was driven by increased sales coupled with controlled operating expenses. Operating expenses increased at a lower percentage
compared to sales increases due to our operational excellence initiatives and the nature of fixed versus variable expenses resulting in operating margin expansion in Europe. The increase in operating profit in Asia Pacific was driven by increases in
sales from volume and product mix. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates tempered sales growth in Asia Pacific, this decline was largely offset by increased hedge gains recorded in 2014 versus 2013.

Non-GAAP operating performance measures

We use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP to evaluate our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of inventory
step-up, certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts, “Certain claims,” goodwill impairment, “Special items,” other expenses related to financing obtained for the
pending Biomet merger and any related effects on our income tax provision associated with



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

these items. We use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating results, it helps to
perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items, and it provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures are used
as metrics for our incentive compensation programs.

Our non-GAAP adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes
for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $1,041.0 million, $988.4 million, and $932.5 million, respectively, and our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $6.06, $5.75, and $5.30, respectively.

The following are reconciliations from our GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our non-GAAP adjusted net earnings and
non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes (in millions, except per share amounts).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows provided
by operating activities were $1,052.8 million in 2014, compared to $963.1 million in 2013. The principal source of cash from operating activities was net earnings. Non-cash items included in net earnings accounted for another $346.4 million of
operating cash in 2014. All other

items of operating cash flows reflect a use of $12.6 million of cash in 2014, compared to a use of $84.9 million in 2013.

The increased cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 were primarily due to improved cash flows generated from receivables collections, especially in Europe, lower funding necessary for our
U.S. pension plans, and receipt of insurance proceeds related to

Durom

Cup product liability claims. These favorable items were partially offset by higher tax payments for certain unresolved matters in order to limit the potential impact of
IRS interest charges and inventory investments.

At December 31, 2014, we had 64 days of sales outstanding in trade
accounts receivable, which was 1 day less than at December 31, 2013. Our days of sales outstanding reflect the reimbursement patterns of the healthcare industry in the markets where we compete. Collection of trade accounts receivable is
influenced by insurance reimbursements and government budgets, among other things. Days of sales outstanding are lowest in our Americas reporting segment, as the U.S. healthcare system has a higher percentage of private-pay insurers who generally
pay more quickly than government-based healthcare systems. In our Europe and Asia Pacific reporting segments, days of sales outstanding are higher, as healthcare is typically sponsored by governments which tend to pay more slowly. Additionally,
there are some seasonal trends in our days of sales outstanding as it usually trends higher in our third quarter due to lower sales volumes and is lower in our fourth quarter when sales volumes are at their highest. Our days of sales outstanding in
the past three years have ranged between 64 and 73 days. We were at the low end of this range as of December 31, 2014 due to improved collections in Europe.

At December 31, 2014, we had 337 days of inventory on hand, an increase of 52 days compared to December 31, 2013. In order to maintain high service levels to our hospital customers in numerous
geographic regions, we consign inventory to them, including all the various sizes of a particular product, so that our products are available when needed for a surgical procedure. As a result, we have a significant amount of inventory on hand. There
are some seasonal trends in our days of inventory on hand, as it usually trends higher in our third quarter due to lower sales volumes and is lower in our fourth quarter when sales volumes are at their highest. Other factors that can affect our days
of inventory on hand include when we build inventory for new product launches, or the level of excess and obsolete inventory charges and gains/losses related to foreign currency that is reported in cost of products sold in any particular period. Our
days of inventory on hand in the past three years have ranged between 285 and 356 days. As of December 31, 2014, our days of inventory on hand were near the high end of this range. The higher inventory balance and days of inventory on hand were
driven by the ongoing global commercialization of new product offerings, the effects of placing more inventory into distributor and hospital consignment and additional inventory in certain Eastern European markets where we now have a direct sales
presence instead of selling to a distributor.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

Cash flows used in investing activities were $469.4 million in 2014, compared to $282.5
million in 2013. Additions to instruments were relatively consistent between 2014 and 2013 as we continued to invest in instruments for significant product launches, such as

Persona

The Personalized Knee System. Spending on other property,
plant and equipment increased in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting cash outlays necessary to complete new product-related investments and to replace older machinery and equipment. We invest some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated debt
securities. The purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities. The timing of these investments can vary from period to period depending on the maturity of the debt securities and
other cash and cash equivalent needs. In the past three years, we have made a number of business acquisitions including ETEX Holdings, Inc., Knee Creations, LLC, NORMED Medizin-Technik GmbH, Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc., and Synvasive Technology,
Inc.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $562.4 million in 2014, compared to $467.3 million in 2013. In 2014, we
returned cash to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends of $145.5 million and share repurchases of $400.5 million. In association with the debt facilities we entered into for the pending Biomet merger, we incurred $64.1 million of debt
issuance costs. In 2014, $250.0 million of our outstanding senior notes matured and were paid. Additionally, financing cash flows continued to benefit from our increased stock price, with many employees exercising stock options.

In 2014, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.22 per share in each quarter. We expect to continue paying cash dividends on
a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The 2014 dividend declarations equated to an annualized rate of $0.88 per share, which
represented a 10 percent increase over the 2013 annualized rate.

As of December 31, 2014, $599.5 million remained
authorized under our $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. Due to the pending merger with Biomet, we suspended repurchases after the first quarter of 2014. Upon completion of the merger, in the near to medium term we
intend to use our cash flows for debt repayment and dividends.

As discussed more completely in Note 15 to our consolidated
financial statements, the IRS has issued proposed adjustments for years 2006 through 2009 reallocating profits between certain of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. We have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with
the IRS. Although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows.

Also as discussed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements, we have recorded a short-term liability of $50.0 million and long-term liability of $307.2 million related to Durom Cup product
liability claims. We expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years. We expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability

claims from insurance carriers. We have received an initial amount of the insurance proceeds we estimate to recover. We have a long-term receivable of $170.3 million remaining for future expected
reimbursements from our insurance carriers.

We expect to fund the $10.35 billion cash portion of the pending Biomet merger
with existing cash on hand, as well as proceeds to be obtained from a $3.0 billion 5-year unsecured term loan (Term Loan) and senior notes that we expect to issue. We have also entered into a $7.66 billion bridge credit agreement (Bridge Credit
Agreement) that may be used to fund the pending merger if we are unable to issue senior notes. The lenders’ commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement will be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of net cash proceeds we receive from the
issuance of the senior notes.

Currently, we have three tranches of senior notes outstanding: $500 million aggregate principal
amount of 4.625 percent notes due November 30, 2019, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 percent notes due November 30, 2021 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent notes due November 30, 2039.
Interest on each series is payable on May 30 and November 30 of each year until maturity.

We may redeem the senior
notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the
debt agreement), plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 and 2021 notes, and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes. We will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date.

We have a senior credit facility (Senior Credit Facility) that contains: (i) the 5-year unsecured Term Loan in the principal amount
of $3.0 billion, and (ii) a 5-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility (Multicurrency Revolving Facility) in the principal amount of $1.35 billion. The Senior Credit Facility replaces a previous credit agreement that provided for a $1.35
billion revolving credit facility that would have matured in May 2017. The Multicurrency Revolving Facility will mature in May 2019, with two one-year extensions available at our option. Borrowings under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility may be
used for general corporate purposes. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2014. The availability of the Term Loan is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the
Biomet merger. The Term Loan will mature five years after the initial borrowing. Borrowings under the Term Loan may only be used by us to fund, in part, the Biomet merger, including the payment of any indebtedness of LVB and its subsidiaries, and to
pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the Biomet merger. We must reduce unused commitments under the Term Loan and prepay the borrowings under the Term Loan with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset
sales, issuances or sales of equity and incurrences of borrowed



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

money indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. The commitments under the Term Loan automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the funding and disbursement of Term Loan funds
to us, (ii) April 24, 2015, as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement or (iii) termination of the merger agreement.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates based upon indices
determined by the currency of the borrowings plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate, or, in the case of borrowings under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility
only, at a fixed-rate determined through a competitive bid process. The Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things,
limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio of no greater than 3.0 to 1.0 in periods prior to any Term Loan funding and no greater than 5.0 to 1.0
in periods after the Term Loan is funded. If our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends. We were in compliance with all covenants under the
Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2014.

Commitments under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees.
On the Multicurrency Revolving Facility, we pay a facility fee at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating. On the Term Loan, we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including
July 23, 2014 through the day the commitments under the Term Loan terminate.

The Bridge Credit Agreement is a 364-day
unsecured committed bridge facility in the principal amount of $7.66 billion. Funding of loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the Biomet merger. Any loans under the Bridge Credit
Agreement will mature 364 days after the funding date of the loans. The Bridge Credit Agreement requires us to reduce unused commitments and prepay the loans with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset sales, issuances or sales of
equity and incurrences of borrowed money indebtedness, such as new senior notes we intend to issue, subject to certain exceptions. Commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of: (i) the
funding and disbursement of the loans, (ii) April 24, 2015, as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, or (iii) termination of the merger agreement. Proceeds of loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement may only be
used to fund, in part, the Biomet merger, including the payment of any indebtedness of LVB and its subsidiaries, and to pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the Biomet merger.

Zimmer Holdings is the borrower under the Bridge Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement bear interest at floating
rates based upon LIBOR plus an

applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate. The Bridge Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative
covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio
of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Bridge Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2014. If our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions
on investments and payment of dividends.

We will pay a funding fee if we borrow under the Bridge Credit Agreement as well as
duration fees based on the outstanding principal amount of the loans in the amount and on the dates specified in the Bridge Credit Agreement. In addition, we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including
July 23, 2014 through the day the commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminate.

We have a term loan agreement
with one of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility for 11.7 billion Japanese Yen (Japan Term Loan) that will mature on May 31, 2018. Borrowings under the Japan Term Loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.61 percent per annum until
maturity.

We also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $31.9 million.

We currently have investment grade credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) of A- and Moody’s Investor
Services (Moody’s) of Baa1. After the announcement of the Biomet merger, S&P placed a CreditWatch with negative implications on our rating and has indicated that it expects to lower our rating to BBB if the merger is completed. Moody’s
placed our rating on review for downgrade and expects to lower our rating to Baa3 if the merger is completed.

We place our
cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.

As of December 31, 2014, we had short-term and long-term investments in debt securities with a fair value of $868.9 million. These
investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and, therefore, we believe we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer. All of these debt securities remain highly-rated and we believe the risk of default by the
issuers is low.

As of December 31, 2014, $1,090.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term
investments were held in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. Repatriation of these assets to the U.S. may have tax consequences. $844.0 million of this amount is
denominated in U.S. Dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk. The balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

Management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility or from the public and private debt markets are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs and to fund our pending merger with Biomet, as well as return cash to stockholders in the form
of dividends. Should additional investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. The following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions):

$63.3 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 are
liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. Defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. Due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset
performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2015. Therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future
contributions to our plans. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.

Also included in other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. Due to the uncertainties inherent
in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. Therefore, this table does not include
any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits. Additionally, other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet include long-term deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in business combinations and fixed
assets. We have excluded these liabilities from this table as well, as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.

We have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon
various events such as the achievement of certain product R&D milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. Since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have
to be made, we have not included them in this table. These payments could range from $0 to $60 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our financial
results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. Significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below.

Excess Inventory and Instruments

– We must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may
ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Accordingly, inventory and instruments
are written down to their net realizable value. To determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and
components. The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for

work-in-process

inventory, which is
recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. Management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions, competitive offerings and
other factors on a regular basis.

Income Taxes

- Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in
determining the consolidated income tax expense.

We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by
taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide
valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to
the U.S.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We record
our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.

We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) guidance on income taxes and we
adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially
different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.

Commitments and Contingencies

– Accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of
internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an
appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.

In addition to our general product liability, we have recorded provisions totaling $471.7 million related to the

Durom

Cup,
including $21.5 million in 2014. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the

Durom

Cup.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

– We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may
not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and
intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these
assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined our U.S. Spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its
estimated fair value. Fair value was determined using a weighting of income and market approaches. Fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair value
under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our U.S. Spine reporting unit.

As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the U.S. Spine reporting unit of $96.0 million in 2012. See Note 8 to our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment. In 2014 and 2013, we employed a similar combination of income and market
approaches to estimate this reporting unit’s fair value and determined there were no

impairment charges necessary. For our annual impairment test in 2014, the goodwill balance of the U.S. Spine reporting unit was $41.0 million. Due to improved operating performance of our U.S.
Spine reporting unit and improving macroenomic conditions, including higher valuation indicators used in our market approach, the U.S. Spine reporting unit’s estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 24 percent
for our 2014 impairment test. Our international Spine goodwill and related net assets are not tested separately for goodwill impairment as they are part of reporting units that contain other product categories.

We have four other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. Our 2013 annual impairment test indicated the estimated fair value
of the U.S. Dental reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 11 percent. For the annual impairment test in 2014, the goodwill balance of the U.S. Dental reporting unit was $169.1 million. In our 2014 annual impairment test,
due to improved operating performance and improving macroenomic conditions, including higher valuation indicators used in our market approach, the U.S. Dental reporting unit’s estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net
assets by 24 percent.

In 2014, for our three other reporting units’ annual impairment test, we performed a qualitative
assessment of changes in fair value from the 2013 income approach. A qualitative assessment was performed because the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its net assets in the 2013
impairment test.

Share-based Payment –

We measure share-based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair
value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of
our stock. Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock. The expected life of stock
options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements to see how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market
risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

prices that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities
and through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be
adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian
Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees. We manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net
exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign
currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. These forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for
periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products sold when the
hedged item affects net earnings.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2014, we had obligations to purchase U.S.
Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees and purchase Swiss Francs and sell
U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January 2015 through June 2017. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2014 were $1,289.8 million. The
notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at December 31, 2014 were $306.3 million. The weighted average contract rates outstanding at December 31, 2014 were Euro:USD 1.34,
USD:Swiss Franc: 0.91, USD:Japanese Yen 97.30, British Pound:USD 1.62, USD:Canadian Dollar 1.08, Australian Dollar:USD 0.89, USD:Korean Won 1,115, USD:Swedish Krona 6.74, USD:Czech Koruna 19.98, USD:Thai Baht 33.01, USD:Taiwan Dollar 29.48,
USD:South African Rand 11.11, USD:Russian Ruble 37.37 and USD:Indian Ruppee 67.14.

We maintain written policies and procedures
governing our risk management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash

flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk
management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in
the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2014 indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies, with no change in the
interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through June 2017, depending on the direction of the change, by the following average approximate amounts (in millions):

Any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation
in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and
losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged.

We had net assets
in legal entities with non-U.S. Dollar functional currencies of $2,113.5 million at December 31, 2014, primarily in Euros, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars. $1,221.0 million of the net asset exposure at December 31, 2014 related to
goodwill recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange
contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency. As a result, foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in
earnings are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

We purchase raw material
commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in
prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

INTEREST RATE RISK

In the normal course of business,
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities.

We invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highly-rated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits. We also have short-term
and long-term investments in highly-rated corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt securities, U.S. government treasury funds, municipal bonds, foreign government debt securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The
primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

We are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents.

We have multiple fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements that we have designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate
obligations on our senior notes due 2019 and 2021. The total notional amounts are $250 million and $300 million for the senior notes due 2019 and 2021, respectively. On the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2019, we receive a
fixed interest rate of 4.625 percent and pay variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average of 133 basis points. On the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2021, we receive a fixed interest rate of 3.375 percent
and pay variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average of 99 basis points.

The interest rate swap agreements
are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. The objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash
equivalents.

These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under GAAP. Changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument.

In 2014, we
entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that we have designated as cash flow hedges of our anticipated issuance of senior notes related to the pending Biomet merger that we anticipate will mature in March 2045.

The forward starting interest rate swaps mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates prior to completion of the senior notes offering. The total notional amounts of the forward starting
interest rate swaps are $1 billion and will settle in March 2015. On the forward starting interest rate swaps, we receive variable interest equal to three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed interest weighted average rate of 3.01 percent. We will defer the
effective portion of the forward starting interest rate swaps over the maturity period of the hedged senior notes, which is thirty years, and recognize any ineffective portion immediately in earnings.

Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2014, a change of 10 percent in interest rates, assuming the
principal amount outstanding remains constant, would not have a material effect on net interest expense. This analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.

CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term
and long-term investments, derivative instruments, counterparty transactions and accounts receivable.

We place our investments
in highly-rated financial institutions or highly-rated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments.

We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform. However, this
loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial
institutions. We manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their
dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. Substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public
and private hospital and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables.

Our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital
and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems. Most notably, in Europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government. Since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries,



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints. The ongoing financial uncertainties in the Euro zone impact the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their
public hospitals. As of December 31, 2014, in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk, our gross short-term and long-term trade accounts receivable combined were $183.1
million. With allowances for doubtful accounts of $9.4 million recorded in those countries, the net balance was $173.7 million, representing 20 percent of our total consolidated short-term and long-term trade accounts receivable balance, net. Italy
and Spain accounted for $164.4 million of that net amount. We are actively monitoring the situations in these countries. We maintain contact with

customers in these countries on a regular basis. We continue to receive payments, albeit at a slower rate than in the past. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate in these
countries, as ultimately we believe the governments in these countries will be able to pay. To the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates, we may have to record significant bad debt
expenses in the future.

While we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in Europe and around the world,
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Zimmer Holdings,
Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the
company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, the
company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management
assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. In making this assessment, the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal

Control-Integrated

Framework (2013)

.

Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, as stated in its report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Zimmer Holdings, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2014, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in

Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

appearing under Part II, Item 7A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Business

We design,
develop, manufacture and market orthopaedic reconstructive, spinal and trauma devices, biologics, dental implants and related surgical products. We also provide other healthcare related services. Orthopaedic reconstructive devices restore function
lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients who have lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal devices are utilized by orthopaedic
surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural
healing process. Our related surgical products include surgical supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation rehabilitation. We have operations in more than 25 countries and market our products in
more than 100 countries. We operate in a single industry but have three reportable geographic segments, the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.

The words “we,” “us,” “our” and similar words refer to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

On April 24, 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement to merge with LVB, the parent company of Biomet, in a cash and stock
transaction valued at approximately $13.35 billion. We will pay $10.35 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and issue 32.7 million shares of our common stock which had a value of approximately $3.0 billion, based on a stock price of
$91.73 per share using the five day volume weighted average price immediately preceding the signing of the agreement. In connection with the merger, we will pay off all of LVB’s outstanding funded debt, and the aggregate cash merger
consideration will be reduced by such amount. The merger, which is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. The merger will position the combined company as a leader in the
$45 billion musculoskeletal industry.

Biomet’s product portfolio includes knee and hip reconstructive products; sports
medicine, extremities and trauma products; spine, bone healing and microfixation products; dental reconstructive products; and cement, biologics and other products. The combination will enhance enterprise diversification with broader franchises in
the Knee, Hip, Surgical, Spine and Dental categories, as well as in the faster-growing Sports Medicine, Extremities and Trauma categories.

We expect to fund the cash portion of the purchase price with existing cash on hand, as well as proceeds obtained from a committed $3.0 billion senior unsecured term loan and up to $7.66 billion in senior
unsecured notes we intend to issue. In May 2014, we entered into a $7.66 billion 364-day bridge credit facility. To the extent the senior unsecured notes are not

issued and sold on or prior to the closing date of the merger, we intend to draw on the bridge credit facility to finance, in part, the cash consideration for the merger and to pay fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the merger. The commitments of the bridge lenders to provide the bridge loan will be permanently reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of net cash proceeds we receive from the issuance of senior unsecured
notes. See Note 11 and Item 7 in this Form 10-K for further information regarding these debt instruments.

Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation

– The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zimmer Holdings and its subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated. Certain amounts in the 2013 and 2012 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation.

Use of Estimates

– The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. which require us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

– The financial statements of
our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for operating results. Unrealized translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. When a transaction is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary’s functional currency, we recognize a transaction gain or loss when the transaction is settled. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses included in net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were not significant.

Revenue Recognition

– We sell product through three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare institutions, referred to as direct channel accounts; 2) through stocking distributors
and healthcare dealers; and 3) directly to dental practices and dental laboratories. The direct channel accounts represented approximately 75 percent of our net sales in 2014. Through this channel, inventory is generally consigned to sales
agents or customers so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures. No revenue is recognized upon the placement of inventory into consignment as we retain title and maintain the inventory on our balance sheet. Upon implantation,
we issue an invoice and revenue is recognized. Pricing for products is generally predetermined by contracts with customers, agents acting on behalf of customer groups or by government regulatory bodies, depending on the market.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

Price discounts under group purchasing contracts are generally linked to volume of implant purchases by customer healthcare institutions within a specified group. At negotiated thresholds within
a contract buying period, price discounts may increase.

Sales to stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices
and dental laboratories accounted for approximately 25 percent of our net sales in 2014. With these types of sales, revenue is recognized when title to product passes, either upon shipment of the product or in some cases upon implantation of
the product. Product is generally sold at contractually fixed prices for specified periods. Payment terms vary by customer, but are typically less than 90 days.

If sales incentives are earned by a customer for purchasing a specified amount of our product, we estimate whether such incentives will be achieved and, if so, recognize these incentives as a reduction in
revenue in the same period the underlying revenue transaction is recognized. Occasionally products are returned and, accordingly, we maintain an estimated sales return reserve that is recorded as a reduction in revenue. Product returns were not
significant for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to
governmental authorities are presented on a net basis and excluded from revenues.

Shipping and
Handling

– Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling of products are reflected in net sales and are not significant. Expenses incurred related to shipping and handling of products are reflected in selling, general and
administrative and were $181.9 million, $163.6 million and $139.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Research and Development

– We expense all research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs include salaries, prototypes, depreciation of equipment used in
research and development, consultant fees and service fees paid to collaborative partners. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when
the milestone results are achieved.

Litigation

– We record a liability for contingent losses, including
future legal costs, settlements and judgments, when we consider it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Special Items

– We recognize expenses resulting directly from our
business combinations, employee termination benefits, certain R&D agreements, certain contract terminations, consulting and professional fees and asset impairment or loss on disposal charges connected with global restructuring, operational and
quality excellence initiatives, and other items as “Special items” in our consolidated statement of earnings. “Special items” included (in millions):

Impairment/loss on disposal of assets relates to impairment of intangible assets that were acquired in
business combinations or impairment of or a loss on the disposal of other assets. This caption also includes the effect of reducing the estimated useful life of certain intangible assets to zero, which resulted in the remaining net book values of
those assets being amortized immediately.

Consulting and professional fees relate to third-party consulting, professional fees
and contract labor related to our quality and operational excellence initiatives, third-party consulting fees related to certain information system implementations, third-party integration consulting performed in a variety of areas such as tax,
compliance, logistics and human resources for our business combinations and pending merger with Biomet, third-party fees related to severance and termination benefits matters and legal fees related to certain litigation matters. Our quality and
operational excellence initiatives are company-wide and include improvements in quality, distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and information technology, among other areas.

In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we eliminated positions as we reduced management layers, restructured certain areas, announced closures of certain facilities, and commenced initiatives to focus on business
opportunities that best support our strategic priorities. As a result of these changes in our work force and headcount reductions in connection with acquisitions, we incurred expenses related to severance benefits, redundant salaries as we worked
through transition periods, share-based compensation acceleration and other employee termination-related costs. The majority of these termination benefits were provided in accordance with our existing or local government policies and are considered



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

ongoing benefits. These costs were accrued when they became probable and estimable and were recorded as part of other current liabilities. The majority of these costs were paid during the year
they were incurred.

Dedicated project personnel expenses include the salary, benefits, travel expenses and other costs
directly associated with employees who are 100 percent dedicated to our operational and quality excellence initiatives or integration of acquired businesses.

Certain R&D agreements relate to agreements with upfront payments to obtain intellectual property to be used in R&D projects that have no alternative future use in other projects.

Relocated facilities expenses are the moving costs and the lease expenses incurred during the relocation period in connection with
relocating certain facilities.

Over the past few years we have acquired a number of U.S. and foreign-based distributors. We
have incurred various costs related to the consummation and integration of those businesses.

Certain litigation matters relate
to net expenses recognized during the year for the estimated or actual settlement of certain pending litigation and similar claims, including matters where we recognized income from a settlement on more favorable terms than our previous estimate, or
we reduced our estimate of a previously recorded contingent liability. These litigation matters have included royalty disputes, patent litigation matters, commercial litigation matters and matters arising from our acquisitions of certain competitive
distributorships in prior years.

Contract termination costs relate to terminated agreements in connection with the integration
of acquired companies and changes to our distribution model as part of business restructuring and operational excellence initiatives. The terminated contracts primarily relate to sales agents and distribution agreements.

Contingent consideration adjustments represent the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations to be paid to the
prior owners of acquired businesses.

Accelerated software amortization is the incremental amortization resulting from a
reduction in the estimated life of certain software. Due to an approved plan to replace certain software, the estimated economic useful life of the existing software was decreased to represent the period of time expected to implement replacement
software. As a result, the amortization from the shortened life of this software is substantially higher than the previous amortization being recognized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

– We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates their fair value.

Investments

– We invest our excess cash and cash equivalents in debt
securities. Our investments include corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt securities, foreign government debt securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit, and are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Investments with a contractual maturity of less than one year are classified as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheet, or in other
non-current assets if the contractual maturity is greater than one year. Changes in fair value for available-for-sale securities are recorded, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet. We
review our investments for other-than-temporary impairment at each reporting period. If an unrealized loss for any investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the loss will be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in the
period the determination is made. See Note 7 for more information regarding our investments.

Accounts
Receivable

– Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables. We grant credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses. We
determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by geographic market and take into consideration historical credit experience, creditworthiness of the customer and other pertinent information. We make concerted efforts to collect all accounts
receivable, but sometimes we have to write-off the account against the allowance when we determine the account is uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $22.3 million and $22.7 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

Inventories

– Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined
on a first-in first-out basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

– Property, plant and equipment is carried
at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and improvements and three to eight years for machinery and equipment. Maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred. We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value.

Software Costs

– We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with
developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs generally include external direct



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software and compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project.
Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line or weighted average estimated user basis when the software is ready for its intended use over the estimated useful lives
of the software, which approximate three to fifteen years.

Instruments

– Instruments are hand-held
devices used by surgeons during total joint replacement and other surgical procedures. Instruments are recognized as long-lived assets and are included in property, plant and equipment. Undeployed instruments are carried at cost or realizable value.
Instruments in the field are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on average estimated useful lives, determined principally in reference to associated product life cycles,
primarily five years. We review instruments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an instrument may not be recoverable. Depreciation of instruments is recognized as selling, general and
administrative expense.

Goodwill

– Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests.
Goodwill has been assigned to reporting units. We perform annual impairment tests by either comparing a reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying amount or doing a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit’s fair value from
the last quantitative assessment to determine if there is potential impairment. We may do a qualitative assessment when the results of the previous quantitative test indicated the reporting unit’s estimated fair value was significantly in
excess of the carrying value of its net assets and we do not believe there have been significant changes in the reporting unit’s operations that would significantly decrease its estimated fair value or significantly increase its net assets. If
a quantitative assessment is performed, the fair value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value of goodwill are determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and/or use of a market approach by looking at market values of comparable
companies. Significant assumptions are incorporated into our discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth rates and risk-adjusted discount rates. We perform this test in the fourth quarter of the year or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit’s assets may not be recoverable. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair
value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $96.0 million related to our U.S. Spine reporting unit. We
did not record a goodwill impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013. See Notes 8 and 9 for more information regarding goodwill and goodwill impairment.

Intangible Assets

– Intangible assets are initially measured at their
fair value. We have determined the fair value of our intangible assets either by the fair value of the consideration exchanged for the intangible asset or the estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the
intangible asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite life, including certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized. Indefinite life intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support
an indefinite life. Intangible assets with a finite life, including core and developed technology, certain trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangibles, intellectual property rights and patents and licenses are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, ranging from less than one year to 40 years. Intangible assets with a finite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds
the estimated fair value of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be determined based upon the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. The fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are
determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis using the relief from royalty method or a qualitative assessment may be performed for any changes to the asset’s fair value from the last quantitative assessment. The relief from royalty
method estimates the cost savings associated with owning, rather than licensing, assets. Significant assumptions are incorporated into these discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth rates, royalty rates and risk-adjusted discount
rates. We may do a qualitative assessment when the results of the previous quantitative test indicated that the asset’s fair value was significantly in excess of its carrying value.

In determining the useful lives of intangible assets, we consider the expected use of the assets and the effects of obsolescence, demand,
competition, anticipated technological advances, changes in surgical techniques, market influences and other economic factors. For technology-based intangible assets, we consider the expected life cycles of products, absent unforeseen technological
advances, which incorporate the corresponding technology. Trademarks and trade names that do not have a wasting characteristic (i.e., there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the useful life)
are assigned an indefinite life. Trademarks and trade names that are related to products expected to be phased out are assigned lives consistent with the period in which the products bearing each brand are expected to be sold. For customer
relationship intangible assets, we assign useful lives based upon historical levels of customer attrition. Intellectual property rights are assigned useful lives that approximate the contractual life of any related patent or the period for which we
maintain exclusivity over the intellectual property.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes under the asset and
liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on
deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

We reduce our
deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets
in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries
that is expected to be remitted to the U.S.

We operate on a global basis and are subject to numerous and complex tax laws and
regulations. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit in multiple federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Income tax audits may require an extended period of time to reach resolution and may result in significant income tax adjustments
when interpretation of tax laws or allocation of company profits is disputed. Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, we record accruals representing management’s best estimate of the probable resolution of
these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We measure all derivative instruments at fair value and report them on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. We maintain written
policies and procedures that permit, under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization, the use of derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes. The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes is prohibited by our policy. See Note 13 for more information regarding our derivative and hedging activities.

Other Comprehensive Income

– Other comprehensive income (OCI) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that
under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net earnings as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. Our OCI is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale securities and amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions.

Treasury Stock

– We account for repurchases of common stock under the cost method and present treasury stock as a
reduction of stockholders’ equity. We reissue common stock held in treasury only for limited purposes.

Noncontrolling
Interest

– In 2011, we made an investment in a company in which we acquired a controlling financial interest, but not 100 percent of the equity. In 2013, we purchased additional shares of the company from the minority
shareholders. Further information related to the noncontrolling interests of that investment has not been provided as it is not significant to our consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Pronouncements

– In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update
(ASU) No. 2014-09 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The ASU provides a five-step model for revenue recognition that all industries will apply to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of a good or service. The
ASU will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. We are in the initial phases of our adoption plans and, accordingly, we are unable to estimate any effect this may have on our revenue recognition practices.

There are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that are expected to have a material effect on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Share-Based Compensation

Our share-based
payments primarily consist of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). Share-based compensation expense was as follows (in millions):

Stock Options

We had two equity compensation plans in effect at December 31, 2014: the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (2009 Plan) and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2009 Plan succeeded the 2006 Stock
Incentive Plan (2006 Plan) and the TeamShare Stock Option Plan (TeamShare Plan). No further awards have been granted under the 2006 Plan or under the TeamShare Plan since May 2009, and shares remaining available for grant under those plans have been
merged into



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

the 2009 Plan. Vested stock options previously granted under the 2006 Plan, the TeamShare Plan and another prior plan, the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, remained outstanding as of December 31,
2014. We have reserved the maximum number of shares of common stock available for award under the terms of each of these plans. We have registered 57.9 million shares of common stock under these plans. The 2009 Plan provides for the grant
of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options, long-term performance awards in the form of performance shares or units, restricted stock, RSUs and stock appreciation rights. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the
Board of Directors determines the grant date for annual grants under our equity compensation plans. The date for annual grants under the 2009 Plan to our executive officers is expected to occur in the first quarter of each year following the
earnings announcements for the previous quarter and full year. The Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides for awards of stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to non-employee directors. It has been our practice to issue shares of common

stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued shares, except in limited circumstances where they are issued from treasury stock. The total number of awards which may be granted in
a given year and/or over the life of the plan under each of our equity compensation plans is limited. At December 31, 2014, an aggregate of 8.7 million shares were available for future grants and awards under these plans.

Stock options granted to date under our plans vest over four years and have a maximum contractual life of 10 years. As established under
our equity compensation plans, vesting may accelerate upon retirement after the first anniversary date of the award if certain criteria are met. We recognize expense related to stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, less awards expected to be forfeited using estimated forfeiture rates. Due to the accelerated retirement provisions, the requisite service period of our stock options range from one to four years. Stock options are granted with an exercise
price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, except in limited circumstances where local law may dictate otherwise.

A summary of stock
option activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows (options in thousands):

We use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock
options. For stock options granted in 2012, expected volatility was derived from the implied volatility of traded options on our stock that were actively traded around the grant date of the stock options with exercise prices similar to the stock
options and maturities of over one year. In 2013 and 2014, we used a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility because the traded options that were actively traded around the grant date of our stock options did not have maturities
of over one year. The expected term of the stock options has been derived from

historical employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term
approximating the expected life of the options. The dividend yield was determined by using an estimated annual dividend and dividing it by the market price of our stock on the grant date.

The following table presents information regarding the weighted average fair value for
stock options granted, the assumptions used to determine fair value, and the intrinsic value of options exercised in the indicated year:

As of December 31, 2014, there was $33.8 million of unrecognized share-based payment expense related
to nonvested stock options granted under our plans. That expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.

RSUs

We have
awarded RSUs to our employees. The terms of the awards have been three to four years. Some of the awards have only service conditions while some have performance and market conditions in addition to service conditions. The service condition-only
awards vest ratably on the anniversary date of the award. The awards that have performance and market conditions vest all at once on the third anniversary date. Future service conditions may be waived if an employee retires after the first
anniversary date of the award, but performance and market conditions continue to apply. Accordingly, the requisite service period used for share-based payment expense on our RSUs range from one to four years.

A summary of nonvested RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows (RSUs in thousands):

For the RSUs with service conditions only, the fair value of the awards was determined based upon the fair
market value of our common stock on the date of grant. For the RSUs with market conditions, a Monte Carlo valuation technique was used to simulate the market conditions of the awards. The outcome of the simulation was used to determine the fair
value of the awards.

We are required to estimate the number of RSUs that will vest and recognize share-based
payment expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2014, we estimate that approximately 866,000 outstanding RSUs will vest. If our estimate were to change in the future, the cumulative effect of the
change in estimate will be recorded in that period. Based upon the number of RSUs that we expect to vest, the unrecognized share-based payment expense as of December 31, 2014 was $31.7 million and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2.2 years. The fair value of RSUs vesting during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 based upon our stock price on the date of vesting was $29.3 million, $32.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively.

The following nonfinancial assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in
millions):

We conduct our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of every year or whenever events
occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In 2012, it was determined that our U.S. Spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its fair value.
The goodwill for this reporting unit was written down to its implied fair value of $41.0 million, resulting in a $96.0 million non-cash impairment charge. The implied fair value of goodwill equals the estimated fair value of a reporting unit minus
the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets. In determining the implied fair value of the U.S. Spine reporting unit’s goodwill, we used unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and its assets and
liabilities. Fair value was determined using a weighting of income and market approaches.

Fair value under the income approach
was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators from publicly traded
companies that are similar to our U.S. Spine reporting unit and considers control premiums that would result from a sale of the reporting unit and the level of assets in the reporting unit versus the comparable companies.

In estimating the future cash flows of the reporting unit, we utilized a combination of market and company specific inputs that a market
participant would use in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. The primary market input was revenue growth rates. These rates were based upon historical trends and estimated future growth drivers such as an aging global population, obesity
and more active lifestyles. Significant company specific inputs included assumptions

regarding how the reporting unit could leverage operating expenses as revenue grows and the impact any new products will have on revenues.

Under the guideline public company methodology, we took into consideration specific risk differences between our reporting unit and the
comparable companies, such as recent financial performance, size risks and product portfolios, among other considerations. Based upon our reporting unit’s recent financial performance, market share and product portfolio, we valued the reporting
unit near the bottom of the valuation indicators of the comparable companies.

The fair value of the reporting unit’s
assets and liabilities were determined by using the same methods that are used in business combination purchase accounting.

Factors that contributed to the 2012 impairment of the U.S. Spine reporting unit included broader market issues as well as company
specific issues. The U.S. spine market was under pressure due to a constrained economic environment leading to continuing high unemployment and payer pushback on the necessity of certain procedures. Additionally, pricing was declining across the
industry. Company specific issues included turnover with our independent sales agents and lack of execution in developing new, competitive products which resulted in a less than optimal product portfolio in our U.S. Spine reporting unit.

Before the economic downturn in 2008, we estimated the U.S. spine market was growing in the low double digits, but declined to flat or in
the low single digits in 2012. Previous goodwill impairment tests forecasted some recovery in the market which did not occur. As we completed our annual operating plan in the fourth quarter of 2012, it became clearer that the U.S. spine market
recovery would take longer than we planned, including the persistence of significant negative pricing pressures. Additionally, we concluded that new product introductions made in 2012 would not have as significant of a positive effect as we had
previously forecasted. As a result, we tempered our expectations of recovery in the U.S. market and for our U.S. Spine reporting unit and recognized an impairment charge.

In our 2013 and 2014 annual goodwill impairment tests of our U.S. Spine reporting unit, we concluded no impairment charge was necessary. In our 2014 annual impairment test, the U.S. Spine reporting
unit’s estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 24 percent.

We have four other reporting
units with goodwill assigned to them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit or a combination of the income approach
and market approach utilizing the guideline public company methodology. Due to challenging market conditions associated with our U.S. Dental reporting unit, our 2013 annual impairment test indicated the estimated fair value of the U.S. Dental
reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by only 11 percent. For the annual impairment test in 2014, the goodwill balance of



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2014 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

the U.S. Dental reporting unit was $169.1 million. In our 2014 annual impairment test, due to improved operating performance and improving macroenomic conditions, including higher valuation
indicators used in our market approach, the U.S. Dental reporting unit’s estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 24 percent.

In 2014, for our three other reporting units’ annual impairment test, we performed a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the 2013 income approach. A qualitative assessment was
performed because the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its net assets in the 2013 impairment test.

We will continue to monitor the fair value of our U.S. Spine and U.S. Dental reporting units as well as our other three reporting units in our interim and annual reporting periods. If estimated cash
flows for these reporting units decrease, we may be required to record further impairment charges in the future. Factors that could result in our cash flows being lower than our current estimates include: 1) decreased revenues caused by unforeseen
changes in the healthcare market, or our inability to generate new product

revenue from our research and development activities, and 2) our inability to achieve the estimated operating margins in our forecasts due to unforeseen factors. Additionally, changes in the
broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates or comparable company valuation indicators, which may impact our estimated fair values.

In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we also recorded $14.2 million, $2.8 million and $11.6 million, respectively, of impairment charges in “Special items” related to certain indefinite lived intangible
assets. The impairment was a result of lower future estimated revenues from products using certain trademarks. The lower future estimated revenues resulted from new competitive products in the marketplace, a trend towards newer, less invasive
products, a decrease in projected revenues in U.S. Dollar terms due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus foreign currencies, negative publicity in the marketplace related to certain hip devices and our challenges in the global
spine market. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2014 the intangible assets that were impaired have been reclassified as a finite lived intangible asset and will be amortized.

Debt

Our debt
consisted of the following (in millions):

In May 2014, we entered into a new credit agreement (Senior Credit Facility). The Senior Credit Facility
contains: (i) a 5-year unsecured term loan facility in the principal amount of $3.0 billion (Term Loan), and (ii) a 5-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility in the principal amount of $1.35 billion (Multicurrency Revolving
Facility). The Senior Credit Facility replaced a previous agreement that provided for a $1.35 billion revolving credit facility that would have matured in May 2017. The Multicurrency Revolving Facility will mature in May 2019, with two one-year
extensions available at our option. Borrowings under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. The availability of the Term Loan is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the Biomet merger. The
Term Loan requires us to reduce unused commitments and prepay the borrowings under the Term Loan with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset sales, issuances or sales of equity and incurrences of borrowed money indebtedness, subject to
certain exceptions. Commitments under the Term Loan automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of: (i) the funding and disbursement of the Term Loan funds to us, (ii) April 24, 2015, as such date may be extended pursuant to the
merger agreement, or (iii) termination of the merger agreement. The Term Loan will mature five years after the initial borrowing. Borrowings under the Term Loan may only be used by us to fund, in part, the Biomet merger, including the payment
of any indebtedness of LVB and its subsidiaries, and to pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the Biomet merger. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2014.

In May 2014, we also entered into a 364-Day Credit Agreement (Bridge Credit Agreement). The Bridge Credit Agreement is a
364-day unsecured committed bridge facility in the principal amount of $7.66 billion. Funding of loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the Biomet merger. Any loans under the Bridge Credit
Agreement will mature 364 days after the funding date of the loans. The Bridge Credit Agreement

requires us to reduce unused commitments and prepay the loans with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset sales, issuances or sales of equity and incurrences of borrowed money
indebtedness, such as new senior notes we intend to issue, subject to certain exceptions. Commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of: (i) the funding and disbursement of the loans,
(ii) April 24, 2015, as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, or (iii) termination of the merger agreement. Proceeds of loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement may only be used to fund, in part, the Biomet
merger, including the payment of any indebtedness of LVB and its subsidiaries, and to pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the Biomet merger.

We have a term loan agreement (Japan Term Loan) with one of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility for 11.7 billion Japanese Yen that will mature on May 31, 2018. Borrowings under the Japan
Term Loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.61 percent per annum until maturity. The estimated fair value of the Japan Term Loan as of December 31, 2014, based upon publicly available market yield curves and the terms of the debt (Level 2),
was $97.6 million.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates based upon indices determined by the currency of the borrowings plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an
alternate base rate, or, in the case of borrowings under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility only, at a fixed-rate determined through a competitive bid process. The Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and
events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio of no greater
than 3.0 to 1.0 in periods prior to any Term Loan funding and no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 in periods after the Term Loan is funded. If our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on
investments and payment of dividends. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2014.

Commitments under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees. On the Multicurrency Revolving Facility, we pay a facility fee at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term
credit rating. On the Term Loan, we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including July 23, 2014 through the day the commitments under the Term Loan terminate.

Zimmer Holdings is the borrower under the Bridge Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement bear interest at floating
rates based upon LIBOR plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior

(Continued)

unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate. The Bridge Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing
arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with
all covenants under the Bridge Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2014. If our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends.

We will pay a funding fee if we borrow under the Bridge Credit Agreement as well as duration fees based on the outstanding principal
amount of the loans in the amount and on the dates specified in the Bridge Credit Agreement. In addition, we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including July 23, 2014 through the day the commitments under
the Bridge Credit Agreement terminate.

In association with the Senior Credit Facility and Bridge Credit Agreement, we incurred
debt issuance costs paid to the lenders. These debt issuance costs, to the extent paid, were recognized as financing cash flows on our consolidated statement of cash flows. For the debt issuance costs related to the Bridge Credit Agreement, we are
recognizing expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated commitment period, which is one year. If we borrow under the Bridge Credit Agreement in the future, any remaining unamortized debt issuance costs will be recognized as interest expense
over the period debt is outstanding under the Bridge Credit Agreement. The related expense for the Bridge Credit Agreement debt issuance costs and the Bridge Credit Agreement and Term Loan unused commitment fees has been presented as “Other
expense” on our consolidated statement of earnings since we have not borrowed against these agreements. The debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan portion of the Senior Credit Facility will be recognized as interest expense under the
effective interest rate method once we borrow on the Term Loan. The debt issuance costs related to the Multicurrency Revolving Facility are being recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the 5-year commitment period of the facility.

We have three tranches of senior notes outstanding: $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent notes due
November 30, 2019, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 percent notes due November 30, 2021 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent notes due November 30, 2039. Interest on each series is payable on
May 30 and November 30 of each year until maturity. The estimated fair value of our senior notes as of December 31, 2014, based on quoted prices for the specific securities from transactions in over-the-counter markets (Level 2), was
$1,460.2 million.

We may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to
maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed; or 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (not including any portion
of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 notes and 2021
notes, and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes. We would also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to the redemption date.

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements which we designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed-rate obligations on our senior notes due 2019 and 2021. See Note 13 for additional
information regarding the interest rate swap agreements.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
$31.9 million.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the weighted average interest rate for our long-term borrowings was
3.5 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. We paid $67.5 million, $68.1 million and $67.8 million in interest during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

OCI refers to
certain gains and losses that under GAAP are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net earnings as these amounts are initially recorded as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. Amounts in OCI may be reclassified to net
earnings upon the occurrence of certain events.

Our OCI is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized
gains and losses on cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions on our defined benefit plans. Foreign currency
translation adjustments are reclassified to net earnings upon sale or upon a complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity. Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges are reclassified to net earnings when
the hedged item affects net earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reclassified to net earnings if we sell the security before maturity or if the unrealized loss is considered to be other-than-temporary. Amounts
related to defined benefit plans that are in OCI are reclassified over the service periods of employees in the plan. The reclassification amounts are allocated to all employees in the plans and, therefore, the reclassified amounts may become part of
inventory to the extent they are considered direct labor costs. See Note 14 for more information on our defined benefit plans.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We are exposed
to certain market risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular
operating and financing activities. Currently, the only risks that we manage through the use of derivative instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Interest Rate Risk

Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges

We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed-rate debt into
variable-rate debt. Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The objective of the
instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents. These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under GAAP. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are
recorded in current earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument.

We have multiple
fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements that we have designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate obligations on our senior notes due 2019 and 2021. The total notional amounts are $250 million and $300 million for the senior
notes due 2019 and 2021, respectively. On the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2019, we receive a fixed interest rate of 4.625 percent and pay variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average of 133 basis
points. On the interest rate swap agreements for the senior notes due 2021, we receive a fixed interest rate of 3.375 percent and pay variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average of 99 basis points.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

In 2014, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that we have designated as cash flow hedges of our anticipated issuance of senior notes related to the pending Biomet merger that we
anticipate will mature in March 2045. The forward starting interest rate swaps mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates prior to completion of the senior notes offering. The total notional amounts of the forward starting interest rate swaps
are $1 billion and will settle in March 2015. On the forward starting interest rate swaps, we receive variable interest equal to three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed interest weighted average rate of 3.01 percent. We will defer the effective portion of
the forward starting interest rate swaps over the maturity period of the hedged senior notes, which is thirty years, and recognize any ineffective portion immediately in earnings.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be
adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To reduce the potential effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on net earnings, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange
forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian
Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

Our revenues are generated in various currencies throughout the world. However, a significant amount of our inventory is produced in U.S. Dollars. Therefore, movements in foreign currency exchange rates
may have different proportional effects on our revenues compared to our cost of products sold. To minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on cash flows, we hedge intercompany sales of inventory expected to occur within the
next 30 months with foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options. We designate these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges.

We perform quarterly assessments of hedge effectiveness by verifying and documenting the critical terms of the hedge instrument and that forecasted transactions have not changed significantly. We also
assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been adverse developments regarding the risk of a counterparty default. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily
recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value, if any, is immediately reported in cost of products
sold.

For foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options outstanding at December 31, 2014, we had obligations to
purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees and obligations to
purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars. These derivatives mature at dates ranging from January 2015 through June 2017. As of December 31, 2014, the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts and options entered into with third
parties to purchase U.S. Dollars were $1,289.8 million. As of December 31, 2014, the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts and options entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs were $306.3 million.

liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency. As a result, any foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward
exchange contracts in the same reporting period. These offsetting gains/losses are recorded in cost of products sold as the underlying assets and liabilities exposed to remeasurement include inventory-related transactions. These contracts are
settled on the last day of each reporting period. Therefore, there is no outstanding balance related to these contracts recorded on the balance sheet as of the end of the reporting period. The notional amounts of these contracts are typically in a
range of $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion per quarter.

Foreign Currency Exchange and Interest Rate Risk

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

In 2011, our subsidiary in Japan, with a functional currency of Japanese Yen, borrowed variable-rate debt of $143.0 million denominated in U.S. Dollars under our previous credit facility. To manage the
foreign currency exchange risk associated with remeasuring the debt to Japanese Yen and the interest rate risk associated with the variable-rate debt, we entered into multiple cross-currency interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount
of 11,798 million Japanese Yen. We designated these swaps as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps was temporarily
recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in interest expense when the hedged item affected net earnings. The cross-currency interest rate swap agreements matured in 2012 and we paid off the subsidiary’s U.S. Dollar debt
with Japanese Yen debt borrowed under our previous credit facility.

The fair value of outstanding derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and
recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2014, together with settled derivatives where the hedged item has not yet affected earnings, was a net unrealized gain of $87.9 million, or $70.0 million after taxes, which is deferred in
accumulated other comprehensive income. Of the net unrealized gain, $89.5 million, or $66.0 million after taxes, is expected to be reclassified to earnings in cost of products sold and a loss of $0.7 million, or $0.5 million after taxes, is expected
to be reclassified to earnings in interest expense over the next twelve months.

Balance Sheet Presentation

As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, all derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. On our
consolidated balance sheets, we recognize individual forward contracts and options with the same counterparty on a net asset/liability basis if we have a master netting agreement with the counterparty. Under these master netting agreements, we are
able to settle derivative instrument assets and liabilities with the same counterparty in a single transaction, instead of settling each derivative instrument separately. We have master netting agreements with all of our counterparties. The fair
value of derivative instruments on a gross basis is as follows (in millions):

Retirement Benefit Plans

We have defined
benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. The employees who are not participating in the defined benefit plans receive additional benefits under our defined contribution plans. Plan benefits are primarily based on years
of credited service and the participant’s average eligible compensation. In addition to the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit pension plans, we sponsor various foreign pension arrangements, including retirement and termination benefit plans
required by local law or coordinated with government sponsored plans.

We use a December 31 measurement date for our
benefit plans.

Defined Benefit Plans

The components of net pension expense for our defined benefit retirement plans were as follows (in millions):

The weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine net pension expense for our defined benefit
retirement plans were as follows:

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the historical and estimated future rates
of return on the different asset classes held in the plans. The expected long-term rate of return is the weighted average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset class. We believe that historical asset results approximate expected
market returns applicable to the funding of a long-term benefit obligation.

Discount rates were determined for each of our
defined benefit retirement plans at their measurement date to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefit payments.

The benefits expected to be paid out in each of the next five years and for the five
years combined thereafter are as follows (in millions):

The U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement plans’ overall investment strategy is to
maximize total returns by emphasizing long-term growth of capital while mitigating risk. We have established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 40 to 45 percent for equity securities, 30 to 35 percent

for debt securities and 20 to 25 percent in non-traditional investments. The plans strive to have sufficiently diversified assets so that adverse or unexpected results from one asset class will
not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We regularly review the investments in the plans and we may rebalance them from time-to-time based upon the target asset allocation of the plans.

For the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans, we maintain an investment policy statement that guides the investment allocation in the plans. The
investment policy statement describes the target asset allocation positions described above. Our benefits committee, along with our investment advisor, monitor compliance with and administer the investment policy statement and the plans’ assets
and oversee the general investment strategy and objectives of the plans. Our benefits committee generally meets quarterly to review performance and to ensure that the current investment allocation is within the parameters of the investment policy
statement.

The investment strategies of foreign based plans vary according to the plan provisions and
local laws. The majority of the assets in foreign based plans are located in Switzerland-based plans. These assets are held in trusts and are commingled with the assets of other Swiss companies with representatives of all the companies making the
investment decisions. The overall strategy is to maximize total returns while avoiding risk. The trustees of the assets have established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 30 to 50 percent in debt securities, 20 to 37 percent in equity
securities, 15 to 24 percent in real estate, 3 to 15 percent in cash funds and 0 to 12 percent in other funds.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our defined benefit pension plans’ assets did
not hold any direct investment in Zimmer Holdings common stock.

Equity securities are valued using a market approach, based on
quoted prices for the specific security from transactions in active exchange markets (Level 1), or in some cases where we are invested in mutual or collective funds, based upon the net asset value per unit of the fund which is determined from quoted
market prices of the underlying securities in the fund’s portfolio (Level 2). Fixed income securities are valued using a market approach, based upon quoted prices for the specific security or from institutional bid evaluations. Some fixed
income securities are in funds with a net asset value per unit which is determined using similar techniques for the underlying securities in the fund’s portfolio. Real estate is valued by discounting to present value the cash flows expected to
be generated by the specific properties.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of
our foreign pension plan assets measured at fair value that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):

We expect that we will have no legally required minimum funding requirements in 2015 for the qualified
U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement plans, nor do we expect to voluntarily contribute to these plans during 2015. Contributions to foreign defined benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $14.0 million in 2015. We do not expect
the assets in any of our plans to be returned to us in the next year.

Defined Contribution Plans

We also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all of the U.S. and Puerto Rico employees and certain employees in other
countries. The benefits offered under these plans are reflective of local customs and practices in the countries concerned. We expensed $32.8 million, $29.6 million and $26.5 million related to these plans for the years ended December 31,
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that an income tax benefit will not be realized.

The components of deferred taxes consisted of the following (in millions):

During the first quarter of 2014, we established a $70.5 million deferred tax asset (and offsetting
valuation allowance) for indefinite lived net operating loss carryforwards in a Luxembourg domiciled holding company. These losses primarily relate to interest deductions on intercompany debt and were generated in periods prior to 2014. Previously,
we were unable to realize a tax benefit for the losses due to the absence of current and future operating income within the Luxembourg subsidiary.

The net operating loss carryovers are available to reduce future federal, state and foreign taxable earnings. At December 31, 2014, $47.8 million of these net operating loss carryovers generally
expire within a period of 1 to 20 years and $69.1 million have an indefinite life. Valuation allowances for net operating loss carryovers have been established in the amount of $99.0 million and $17.3 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. The tax credit carryovers are available to offset future federal, state and foreign tax liabilities. At December 31, 2014, these tax credit carryovers generally expire within a period of 1 to 10 years. We have established
valuation allowances for certain tax credit carryovers in the amount of $11.5 million and $14.9 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The capital loss carryover is also available to reduce future federal capital gains. At
December 31, 2014, these capital loss carryovers generally expire within a period of 2 to 4 years. We have established valuation allowances for certain capital loss carryovers in the amount of $7.4 million and $7.8 million at

December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The remaining valuation allowances of $4.9 million and $2.7 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, relate primarily to potential
capital losses.

At December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate of approximately $3,204.0 million of unremitted earnings of
foreign subsidiaries that have been, or are intended to be, indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. If the total undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted, a significant amount of the additional tax would
be offset by the allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practical for us to determine the additional tax related to remitting these earnings.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

We recognize accrued interest and penalties, related to unrecognized tax benefits, as income tax expense.
During 2014, we accrued interest and penalties of $5.7 million, and as of December 31, 2014, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $47.8 million.

During 2013, we accrued interest and penalties of $8.2 million, and as of December 31, 2013, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $42.1 million. During 2012, we accrued interest
and penalties of $23.2 million, and as of December 31, 2012, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $33.9 million.

We operate on a global basis and are subject to numerous and complex tax laws and regulations. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit in multiple federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Income
tax audits may require an extended period of time to reach resolution and may result in significant income tax adjustments when interpretation of tax laws or allocation of company profits is disputed. The net amount of tax liability for unrecognized
tax benefits may change within the next twelve months due to changes in audit status, expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements of tax assessments and other events which could impact our determination of unrecognized tax benefits.
Currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount by which our unrecognized tax benefits will change.

During the second quarter of 2014, the IRS began the audit of our U.S. federal returns for
the years 2010 through 2012. During the second quarter of 2011, the IRS concluded its examination of our U.S. federal returns for years 2005 through 2007 and during the fourth quarter of 2013, the IRS concluded its examination of our U.S. federal
returns for years 2008 through 2009. For years 2006 through 2009, the IRS has proposed adjustments reallocating profits between certain of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. During the second quarter of 2014, the IRS issued a corrected Revenue Agent
Report for years 2008 through 2009, assessing a penalty with respect to a 2008 uncertain tax position. We have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the IRS. During the second quarter of 2014, the IRS issued a
statutory notice of deficiency for the years 2005 through 2007. We are contesting this deficiency notice and we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court during the third quarter of 2014. Although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed
tax issues is uncertain, we may resolve certain tax matters with the IRS within the next twelve months and pay amounts for other unresolved tax matters in order to limit the potential impact of IRS interest charges. Final resolution of these matters
could have a material impact on our income tax expense, results of operations and cash flows for future periods.

State income
tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective return. The state impact of any federal changes generally remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year
after formal notification to the states. We have various state income tax returns in the process of examination, administrative appeals or litigation.

Our tax returns are currently under examination in various foreign jurisdictions. Foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from 3 to 5 years. Years still open to examination by
foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include: Australia (2010 onward), Canada (2008 onward), France (2011 onward), Germany (2009 onward), Ireland (2010 onward), Italy (2010 onward), Japan (2010 onward), Korea (2010 onward), Puerto Rico

Product Liability-Related Claims

We are subject to product liability claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We establish standard accruals
for product liability claims in conjunction with outside counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for open claims, related legal fees and claims incurred but not reported. These standard product liability accruals
are recognized in selling, general and administrative expense. We may also establish provisions for certain product liability claims outside of the standard accruals that are recorded separately on our statement of earnings, such as the provision
for claims related to the

Durom

Cup discussed below. We maintain insurance, subject to self-insured retention requirements, for losses from these and other claims.

On July 22, 2008, we temporarily suspended marketing and distribution of the

Durom

Cup in the U.S. Subsequently, a number of product liability lawsuits were filed against us in various
U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury, and they generally allege that the

Cup contains defects that result in complications and premature revision of the device. We have settled some of these
claims and others are still pending. The majority of the pending U.S. lawsuits are currently in a federal Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) in the District of New Jersey (

Cup-related claims, including $21.5 million, $47.0 million and $15.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

We maintain insurance for product liability claims, subject to self-insurance retention requirements. In 2008, we notified our insurance
carriers of potential claims related to the

Durom

Cup. As of December 31, 2014, we have exhausted our self-insured retention under our insurance program and have a claim for insurance proceeds for ultimate losses which exceed the
self-insured retention amount, subject to a 20 percent co-payment requirement and a cap. We believe our contracts with the insurance carriers are enforceable for these claims and, therefore, it is probable that we will recover some amount from our
insurance carriers. We have received an initial amount of the insurance proceeds we estimate to recover and expect to receive more in the near future. We have a $170.3 million receivable in “Other assets” remaining on our consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 for estimated insurance recoveries. As is customary in this process, our insurance carriers have reserved all rights under their respective policies and could still ultimately deny coverage for some or all
of our insurance claims.

Our estimate as of December 31, 2014 of the remaining liability for
all

Durom

Cup-related claims is $357.2 million, of which $50.0 million is classified as short-term in “Other current liabilities” and $307.2 million is classified as long-term in “Other long-term
liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to pay the majority of the

Durom

Cup-related claims within the next few years.

Our understanding of clinical outcomes with the

Durom

Cup and other large diameter hip cups continues to evolve. We rely on significant estimates in determining the provisions
for

Durom

Cup-related claims, including our estimate of the number of claims that we will receive and the average amount we will pay per claim. The actual number of claims and the actual amount we pay per claim may differ from our
estimates. Among other factors, since our understanding of the clinical outcomes is still evolving, we cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from

Durom

Cup-related claims in excess of the
losses we have accrued.

On August 20, 2008, Margo and Daniel Polett filed an action against us and an unrelated third
party, Public Communications, Inc. (PCI), in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania seeking an unspecified amount of damages for injuries and loss of consortium allegedly suffered by Mrs. Polett and her spouse, respectively. The
complaint alleged that defendants were negligent in connection with Mrs. Polett’s participation in a promotional video featuring one of our knee products. The case was tried in November 2010 and the jury returned a verdict in favor of
plaintiffs. The jury awarded $27.6 million in compensatory damages and apportioned fault 30 percent to plaintiffs, 34 percent to us and 36 percent to PCI. Under applicable law, we may be liable for

any portion of the damages apportioned to PCI that it does not pay. On December 2, 2010, we and PCI filed a Motion for Post-Trial Relief seeking a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new
trial or a remittitur. On June 10, 2011, the trial court entered an order denying our Motion for Post-Trial Relief and affirming the jury verdict in full and entered judgment for $20.3 million against us and PCI. On June 29, 2011, we filed
a Notice of Appeal to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania and posted a bond for the verdict amount plus interest. Oral argument before the appellate court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was held on March 13, 2012. On March 1, 2013, the
Superior Court of Pennsylvania vacated the $27.6 million judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. On March 15, 2013, plaintiffs filed a motion for re-argument

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which was granted on May 21, 2014. Oral argument before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania took place on October 8, 2014. Although we are defending this lawsuit vigorously, its ultimate resolution is
uncertain.

Following a wide-spread advertising campaign conducted by certain law firms beginning in 2010, a number of product
liability lawsuits have been filed against us in various jurisdictions. The plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury, alleging that certain products within the

NexGen

Knee System suffer from defects that cause them to loosen prematurely.
The majority of the cases are currently pending in a federal Multidistrict Litigation in the Northern District of Illinois (

In Re: Zimmer NexGen Knee Implant Products Liability Litigation

). Other cases are pending in other state and federal
courts, and additional lawsuits may be filed. As of December 31, 2014, discovery in these lawsuits was on-going. Bellwether trials are expected to commence in the third quarter of 2015. We have not accrued an estimated loss relating to these
lawsuits because we believe the plaintiffs’ allegations are not consistent with the record of clinical success for these products. As a result, we do not believe that it is probable that we have incurred a liability, and we cannot reasonably
estimate any loss that might eventually be incurred. Although we are vigorously defending these lawsuits, their ultimate resolution is uncertain.

damages award and vacating and remanding the attorneys’ fees award. We accrued an estimated loss of $70.0 million related to this matter in the year ended December 31, 2014. On January 20, 2015, Stryker filed a motion with the Federal
Circuit for a rehearing en banc. Although we are defending this lawsuit vigorously, its ultimate resolution is uncertain.

Shareholder
Derivative Action

On June 16, 2014, a shareholder derivative action,

Hays v. Dvorak et al.

, was filed in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The plaintiff sought to maintain the action purportedly on our behalf against certain of our current and former directors and two non-director executive officers. The plaintiff alleged, among other things,
breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, unjust enrichment and gross mismanagement by the named defendants based on the trial court’s ruling in the patent infringement lawsuit brought by Stryker described above relating to certain of
our

Pulsavac

Plus Wound Debridement Products. The plaintiff did not seek damages from us, but instead requested damages of an unspecified amount on our behalf. The plaintiff also sought

equitable relief to remedy the individual defendants’ alleged misconduct, attorneys’ fees, costs and other relief. On August 18, 2014, we filed a motion to stay or dismiss the
complaint, and the individual defendants filed a joinder motion. On December 15, 2014, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted our motion to stay pending a ruling from the Federal Circuit on the appeal in the Stryker patent infringement case.
The Federal Circuit issued a ruling on December 19, 2014, as described above. On February 6, 2015, all claims pending in this shareholder derivative action were dismissed without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation of dismissal.

Regulatory Matters

In September 2012, we received a warning letter from the FDA citing concerns relating to certain manufacturing and validation processes pertaining to

Trilogy

Acetabular System products
manufactured at our Ponce, Puerto Rico manufacturing facility. We have provided detailed responses to the FDA as to our corrective actions and will continue to work expeditiously to address the issues identified by the FDA during inspections in
Ponce. As of December 31, 2014, the warning letter remains pending. Until the violations are corrected, we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA, including seizure, injunction and/or civil monetary penalties. Additionally,
requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments related to products manufactured at the Ponce facility may not be granted and premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the quality system regulation deviations are reasonably
related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. In addition to responding to the warning letter described above, we are in the process of addressing various FDA Form 483 inspectional observations at certain of our
manufacturing facilities. The ultimate outcome of these matters is presently uncertain.
