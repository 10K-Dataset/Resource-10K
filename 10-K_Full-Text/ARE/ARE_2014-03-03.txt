ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”).  We are the largest and leading REIT focused principally on owning, operating, developing, redeveloping, and acquiring high-quality, sustainable real estate for the broad and diverse life science industry.  Founded in 1994, Alexandria pioneered the laboratory/office niche and has become the leading life science real estate brand and dominant market presence in the top life science clusters, including Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Greater New York City, Maryland, Seattle, and Research Triangle Park.  Alexandria manages its properties through fully integrated regional and life science teams with unparalleled real estate and life science expertise.  As the Landlord of Choice to the Life Science Industry

®

, Alexandria is known for its high-quality and diverse client tenant base.  Our high-credit client tenants span the life science industry, including renowned academic and medical institutions, multinational pharmaceutical companies, public and private biotechnology entities, United States (“U.S.”) government research agencies, medical device companies, industrial biotech companies, venture capital firms, and life science product and service companies.  Alexandria has a proven and superior track record of developing Class A laboratory/office assets focused primarily in key urban science and technology center campuses in AAA cluster locations adjacent to leading academic medical research centers, and offering highly creative amenities that drive client tenant productivity and foster innovation.  We believe these advantages result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term value.  We executed our initial public offering in 1997 and received our investment-grade ratings in 2011.

As of

December 31, 2013

, Alexandria’s asset base consisted of

30.9 million

square feet, including

17.5 million

rentable square feet (“RSF”) of operating and value-creation development/redevelopment assets, as well as land supporting an additional

13.4 million

square feet of ground-up development projects.  The occupancy percentage of our operating properties was approximately

94.4%

as of

December 31, 2013

.  Investment-grade client tenants represented

51%

of our total annualized base rent (“ABR”) as of

December 31, 2013

.  The comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of our property acquisition, development, and redevelopment activities.


Business objective and strategies

Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term asset value based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth.  Key elements of our strategy are our consistent focus on Class A laboratory/office assets and operations focused primarily in key urban science and technology center campuses in AAA life science cluster locations adjacent to life science entities driving growth and technological advances within each cluster.  These key urban science and technology center campus locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for client tenants, and a limited supply of available space.  They represent highly desirable locations for tenancy by life science entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses.  Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep and broad life science and real estate relationships in order to identify and attract new and leading life science client tenants and to source additional value-creation real estate.

The following chart summarizes the growth of the ABR of our assets in our key cluster submarkets:

Our client tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science industry and reflects our focus on regional, national, and international client tenants with substantial financial and operational resources.  For a more detailed description of our properties and client tenants, see “Item 2. Properties.”  We have an experienced Board of Directors and are led by a senior management team with extensive experience in both the real estate and life science industries.

Acquisitions

We seek to identify and acquire high-quality life science properties in our target life science cluster markets.  Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy.  When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective property or properties, including:

Ÿ

Adjacency to centers of innovation and technological advances;

Ÿ

Location of the property and our strategy in the relevant market;

Ÿ

Quality of existing and prospective client tenants;

Ÿ

Condition and capacity of the building infrastructure;

Ÿ

Quality and generic characteristics of the laboratory facilities;

Ÿ

Physical condition of the structure and common area improvements;

Ÿ

Opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for re-tenanting occupied space;

Ÿ

Availability of land for future ground-up development of new laboratory/office space; and

Ÿ

Opportunities to redevelop existing space into higher-rent, generic, and reusable laboratory/office space.


Development

A key component of our long-term business model is ground-up development projects.  Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects with significant pre-leasing where we expect to achieve appropriate investment returns and generally match a source of funds for this use.  Our ground-up development projects focus primarily on investment in generic and reusable laboratory/office improvements, rather than tenant-specific improvements.

Redevelopment

Another key component of our long-term business model is the redevelopment of existing office, warehouse, or shell space into generic and reusable laboratory/office space that can be leased at higher rates.  Our redevelopment strategy includes significant pre-leasing of certain projects prior to the commencement of redevelopment.

Balance sheet and financial strategy

We seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders through the ownership, operation, management, and selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of life science properties, as well as management of our balance sheet.  In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution by:

Ÿ

Maintaining significant liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit, available commitments under secured construction loans, and cash and cash equivalents;

Ÿ

Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year;

Ÿ

Maintaining low to modest leverage;

Ÿ

Minimizing variable interest rate risk;

Ÿ

Maintaining strong and stable operating cash flows;

Ÿ

Renewing existing client tenant space at higher rental rates to the extent possible;

Ÿ

Minimizing tenant improvement costs;

Ÿ

Improving investment returns through leasing of vacant space and replacing existing client tenants with new client tenants at higher rental rates;

Ÿ

Maintaining solid occupancy while also maintaining high lease rental rates;

Ÿ

Realizing contractual rental rate escalations, which are currently provided for in approximately

95%

of our leases (on an RSF basis);

Ÿ

Implementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in client tenant leases for operating expenses and certain capital expenditures;

Ÿ

Selectively selling real estate assets, primarily non-income-producing land parcels;

Ÿ

Selectively acquiring high-quality life science properties in our target life science cluster markets at prices that enable us to realize attractive returns;

Ÿ

Selectively developing properties in our target life science cluster markets; and

Ÿ

Selectively redeveloping existing office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into generic laboratory/office space that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target life science cluster markets.


Client tenants

Competition

In general, other life science properties are located in close proximity to our properties.  The amount of rentable space available in any market could have a material effect on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can earn.  In addition, we compete for investment opportunities with other REITs, insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies, and owners/occupants.  Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to invest more than we can or accept more risk than we are willing to accept.  These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a client tenant or the geographic concentration of their investments.  In addition, as a result of their financial resources, our competitors may offer more free rent concessions, lower rental rates, or higher tenant improvement allowances, in order to attract tenants. These leasing incentives could hinder our ability to maintain or raise rents and attract or retain tenants.  Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.  Competition in acquiring existing properties and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other REITs, has been very strong over the past several years.  However, we believe we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors, as we are the first publicly traded REIT to focus primarily on the life science real estate niche; we are the largest owner, manager, and developer of life science properties, in key life science markets; and we have the most important relationships in the life science industry.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions and successfully operate required properties” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors – We face substantial competition in our target markets.”

Financial information about our operating segment

See Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements for information about our operating segment.

Regulation

General

Properties in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas.  We believe we have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties.


Americans with Disabilities Act

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA.  The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable.  We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA.  However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors -

We may incur significant costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws.

”

Environmental matters

Under various environmental protection laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property, and may be required to investigate and clean up contamination located on or emanating from that property.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several.  Previous owners used some of our properties for industrial and other purposes, so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination.  The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or may materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.

Some of our properties may have asbestos-containing building materials.  Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements.  These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.

In addition, some of our client tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties.  Environmental laws and regulations subject our client tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities or from previous uses of those properties.  Environmental liabilities could also affect a client tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us.  We require our client tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors -

We could be held liable for damages resulting from our client tenants’ use of hazardous materials.

”

Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on the properties in our portfolio.  Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties, and do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations, or an asbestos survey.  To date, these assessments have not revealed any material environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed all environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns, which may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances, or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors -

We may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws.

”

Insurance

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties.  We select policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice.  In the opinion of management, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured.  In addition, we have obtained earthquake insurance for certain properties located in the vicinity of known active earthquake faults.  We also carry environmental remediation insurance and title insurance on our properties.  We generally obtain our title insurance policies when we acquire the property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property.  Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors –

Our insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors

may adversely affect our overall business,

financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to make distributions to our stockholders, access to capital, or the market price of our common stock, as further described in each risk factor below.  In addition to the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, one should carefully review and consider the information contained in our other reports and periodic filings that we make with the SEC.  Those risk factors could materially affect our overall business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to make distributions to our stockholders, access to capital, or the market price of our common stock.  The risks that we describe in our public filings are not the only risks that we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

A global financial crisis, high structural unemployment, and other events or circumstances beyond the control of the Company may adversely affect its industry, business, results of operations, contractual commitments, and access to capital.

What began initially in 2007 and 2008 as a “subprime” mortgage crisis turned into an extraordinary U.S. and worldwide structural economic and financial crisis coupled with the rapid decline of the consumer economy.  From 2008 through 2010, significant concerns over energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, and a declining real estate market in the U.S. contributed to increased volatility, diminished expectations for the economy and the markets, and high levels of structural unemployment by historical standards.  These factors, combined with volatile oil prices and fluctuating business and consumer confidence, precipitated a steep economic decline.  From 2011 through 2013, the economy showed signs of improvement, but recovery has been slow and volatile.  Further, severe financial and structural strains on the banking and financial systems have led to significant lack of trust and confidence in the global credit and financial system.  Consumers and money managers have liquidated and may liquidate equity investments, and consumers and banks have held and may hold cash and other lower-risk investments, resulting in significant and, in some cases, catastrophic declines in the equity capitalization of companies and failures of financial institutions.  Although U.S. bank earnings and liquidity are on the rebound, the potential of significant future bank credit losses creates uncertainty for the lending outlook.  Additionally, job growth remains sluggish, and sustained high unemployment can further hinder economic growth.


Recent financial and economic trouble in emerging-market economies may adversely impact the U.S. and global economies.

Since the beginning of 2014, several emerging-market economies, including Argentina, Venezuela, Ukraine, Hungary, and Thailand are experiencing severe economic and political turmoil.  Other emerging economies, including India, Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa are also reporting significant economic issues including fiscal deficits, falling growth rates, above target-inflation and political uncertainty from upcoming legislative and/or presidential elections.  It is not possible to predict whether this economic and political turmoil might negatively impact the developed economies around the world, including the U.S.  If these macro-economic and political issues are not managed appropriately, they could lead to currency, sovereign debt or banking crises and other financial turmoil and uncertainty.  Continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of federal income tax increases, debt policy, and government spending restrictions may adversely affect our results of operations.

Global macroeconomic conditions affect our client tenants’ businesses.  Developments such as the recent recession and instability in the banking and government sectors of the U.S. and Europe, and/or the negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of government tax increases, debt policy, and spending restrictions, may have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.  Volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions could undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets and cause our client tenants to reduce or defer their spending, which would negatively affect our business.  Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time.  Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographic regions in which we operate and the industries we serve may in the future affect demand for our services.  A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our client tenants in North America.  Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and effectively build our revenue and spending plans.  Economic volatility and uncertainty are particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and resulting changes in demand patterns to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations.  Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.  These risks may impact our overall liquidity, our borrowing costs, or the market price of our common stock.

Failure of the U.S. federal government to manage its fiscal matters or to raise or further suspend the debt ceiling, and changes in the amount of federal debt, may negatively impact the economic environment and adversely impact our results of operations.

The Budget Control Act of 2011 provides for a reduction of $1.1 trillion of U.S. federal government discretionary spending over the next decade through a series of automatic across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration.  Although the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was enacted on January 2, 2013, delayed the effective date of sequestration to provide an additional opportunity for the U.S. Congress and the President to agree on alternative deficit reduction options, sequestration went into effect on March 1, 2013, and will remain in effect in the absence of further legislative action.

The U.S. federal government has established a limit on the level of federal debt that the U.S. federal government can have outstanding, often referred to as the debt ceiling.  U.S. federal debt is expected to reach the current debt ceiling in the coming months.  The U.S. Congress has authority to raise the debt ceiling, and has done so in the past.  For example, in 2011, the U.S. Congress raised the debt ceiling by enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011, resulting in sequestration and the lowering of the credit rating of the U.S. federal government.  More recently, the U.S. Congress temporarily increased the debt ceiling following a partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government in October 2013.  Absent an increase in, or suspensions to, the debt ceiling in 2014, the U.S. federal government may partially shut down again and/or default on its existing loans as a result of reaching the debt ceiling.

An inability of the U.S. federal government to manage its fiscal matters, reduce the duration and scope of sequestration, or manage its debt may result in the loss of economic confidence domestically and globally, reduce investment spending, increase borrowing costs, impact availability and cost of capital, and significantly reduce economic activity.  Furthermore, a failure by the U.S. federal government to enact appropriate fiscal legislation may significantly impact the national and global economic and financial environment and affect our business and the businesses of our client tenants.  If economic conditions severely deteriorate as a result of government fiscal gridlock, our ability to lease space to our client tenants may be significantly impacted.


The downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and the economic crisis in Europe could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition, and earnings.

Recent U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns, together with sovereign debt conditions in Europe, have increased the possibility of additional downgrades of sovereign credit ratings and economic slowdowns.  Although U.S. lawmakers had passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. from “AAA” to “AA+” in August 2011.  The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. government’s sovereign credit rating, or its perceived creditworthiness, is inherently unpredictable and could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions.  In addition, certain European nations have recently experienced varying degrees of financial stress, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.  Despite assistance packages to Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, and the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, we do not know whether the recent sovereign financial difficulties within the European Union governments will reemerge with a higher degree of negative impact to the financial markets.  Market concerns over the direct and indirect exposure of European banks and insurers to these European Union peripheral nations have resulted in a widening of credit spreads and increased costs of funding for some European financial institutions.  There can be no assurance that government or other measures to aid economic recovery will be effective.  These developments, and the U.S. government’s credit concerns in general, could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms.  In addition, the lowered credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which may exert downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.  Continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve could adversely impact our financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

In recent years, various monetary policies undertaken by the Federal Reserve have involved quantitative easing, which involves open market transactions by monetary authorities to stimulate economic activity through the purchase of assets with longer maturities than short-term government bonds.  Among other things, quantitative easing is intended to create or maintain a low-interest-rate environment and to stimulate economic activity.

In May 2013, the financial markets began interpreting comments by members of the Federal Reserve, including its chairman, that its quantitative easing would begin to be reduced sometime in 2013. The Federal Reserve commenced the so-called “tapering” of quantitative easing in January 2014 and may cease quantitative easing entirely in 2014, depending upon, among other factors, the Federal Reserve’s assessment of the performance of the U.S. economy.  Because of expectations for near-term tapering of quantitative easing, the markets experienced an abrupt transition to higher long-term interest rates in May and June 2013, and market interest rates may continue to rise if the Federal Reserve follows through with its current tapering policy.  Increases in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under our unhedged variable rate borrowings and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt.  In addition, increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and a decrease in the market price of our common stock.  Increases in market interest rates may also adversely affect the securities markets generally, which could reduce the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance.  Accordingly, unfavorable changes to our borrowing costs and stock price could significantly impact our ability to raise new debt and equity capital going forward.

Changes in laws, regulations, and financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations.

As a response, in large part, to perceived abuses and deficiencies in current regulations believed to have caused or exacerbated the recent global financial crisis, legislative, regulatory, and accounting standard-setting bodies around the world are engaged in an intensive, wide-ranging examination and rewriting of the laws, regulations, and accounting standards that have constituted the basic playing field of global and domestic business for several decades.  In many jurisdictions, including the U.S., the legislative and regulatory response has included the extensive reorganization of existing regulatory and rule-making agencies and organizations, and the establishment of new agencies with broad powers.  This reorganization has disturbed longstanding regulatory and industry relationships and established procedures.

The rule-making and administrative efforts have focused principally on the areas perceived as having contributed to the financial crisis, including banking, investment banking, securities regulation, and real estate finance, with spillover impacts on many other areas.  These initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the U.S. at least since the wave of lawmaking, regulatory reform, and government reorganization that followed the Great Depression.


The global financial crisis and the aggressive government and accounting profession reaction thereto have occurred against a backdrop of increasing globalization and internationalization of financial and securities regulation that began prior to the recent financial crisis.  As a result of this ongoing trend, financial and investment activities previously regulated almost exclusively at a local or national level are increasingly being regulated, or at least coordinated, on an international basis, with national rule-making and standard-setting groups relinquishing varying degrees of local and national control to achieve more uniform regulation and reduce the ability of market participants to engage in regulatory arbitrage between jurisdictions.  This globalization trend has continued, arguably with an increased sense of urgency and importance, since the financial crisis.

This high degree of regulatory uncertainty, coupled with considerable additional uncertainty regarding the underlying condition and prospects of global, domestic, and local economies, has created a business environment that makes business planning and projections even more uncertain than is ordinarily the case for businesses in the financial and real estate sectors.

In the commercial real estate sector in which we operate, the uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting authorities to fundamentally rewrite major bodies of accounting literature constitute a significant source of uncertainty as to the basic rules of business engagement.  Changes in accounting standards and requirements, including the potential requirement that U.S. public companies prepare financial statements in accordance with international standards, proposed lease and investment property accounting standards, and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of “fair value” measures, may have a significant effect on our financial results and on the results of our client tenants, which would have a secondary impact on us.  New accounting pronouncements and interpretations of existing pronouncements are likely to continue to occur at an accelerated pace as a result of recent Congressional and regulatory actions and continuing efforts by the accounting profession itself to reform and modernize its principles and procedures.

Although we have not been as directly affected by the wave of new legislation and regulation as banks and investment banks, we may also be adversely affected by new or amended laws or regulations; by changes in federal, state, or foreign tax laws and regulations; and by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations.  In the U.S., the financial crisis and continuing economic slowdown prompted a variety of legislative, regulatory, and accounting profession responses.

The federal legislative response culminated in the enactment on July 21, 2010, of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”).  The Dodd-Frank Act contains far-reaching provisions that substantially revise, or provide for the revision of, longstanding, fundamental rules governing the banking and investment banking industries, and provide for the broad restructuring of the regulatory authorities in these areas.  The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, profound changes in the ground rules for financial business activities in the U.S.

To a large degree, the impacts of the legislative, regulatory, and accounting reforms to date are still not clear.  Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rule making by regulatory authorities.  While we do not currently expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant direct effect on us, the Dodd-Frank Act’s impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time.  The Dodd-Frank Act, including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals directed at the financial or real estate industries or affecting taxation that are proposed or pending in the U.S. Congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework within which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable.  The Dodd-Frank Act also has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, substantial changes and dislocations in the banking industry and the financial services sector in ways that could have significant effects on, for example, the availability and pricing of unsecured credit, commercial mortgage credit, and derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, which are important aspects of our business.  Accordingly, new laws, regulations, and accounting standards, as well as changes to, or new interpretations of, currently accepted accounting practices in the real estate industry may adversely affect our results of operations.


The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, and we cannot predict the effect of such regulation on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required, and continue to require, the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas.  For example, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments.  Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities.  In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that directly affect other participants in the real estate and capital markets, such as banks, investment funds, and interest rate hedge providers, could have indirect, but material, impacts on our business that cannot now be predicted.  Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear.  The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of business activities, require changes to certain business practices, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

Changes in the system for establishing U.S. accounting standards may result in adverse fluctuations in our reported asset and liability values and earnings, and may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations.

Accounting for public companies in the U.S. has historically been conducted in accordance with GAAP as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held companies.  The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) is a London-based independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).  IFRS generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in Europe and in developed nations in other parts of the world.

IFRS differs in material respects from GAAP.  Among other things, IFRS has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities than GAAP.  “Fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to GAAP, which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation.

The SEC released a final report on its IFRS work plan, which indicates the SEC still needs to analyze and consider whether IFRS should be incorporated into the U.S. financial reporting system.  It is unclear at this time how and when the SEC will propose that GAAP and IFRS be harmonized if the decision to incorporate is adopted.  In addition, incorporating a new method of accounting and adopting IFRS will be a complex undertaking.  We may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of IFRS.  Since these are new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion is uncertain.

We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of IFRS on our financial position and results of operations.  Such evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity regarding the specific proposed standards that will be adopted.  Until there is more certainty with respect to the standards to be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to IFRS could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations.

Changes in financial accounting standards related to accounting for leases and investments in real estate may adversely impact us.

The regulatory boards and government agencies which determine financial accounting standards and disclosures in the U.S., including the FASB and the IASB (collectively, the “Boards”) and the SEC, continually change and update the financial accounting standards we must follow.  Currently, the Boards are considering, among other items, proposed changes to the following:

Ÿ

The accounting standards for leases for both lessees and lessors; and

Ÿ

The accounting standards for investments in real estate.

These proposals may or may not ultimately be implemented by the Boards.  If some or all of the current proposals were to become final standards, our balance sheet, results of operations, or market price of common stock could be significantly impacted.  Such potential impacts include, without limitation:

Ÿ

Significant changes to our balance sheet relating to the recognition of operating leases as assets or liabilities based on existing lease terms and whether we are the lessor or lessee;


Ÿ

Significant fluctuations in our reported results of operations, including fluctuations in our expenses related to amortization of new lease-related assets and/or liabilities and assumed interest costs with leases; and

Ÿ

The recognition of gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation changes in investments in real estate.

Changes in lease accounting standards could also potentially impact the structure and terms of future leases since our client tenants may seek to limit lease terms to avoid recognizing lease obligations on their financial statements.

Changes in financial accounting standards may adversely impact our financial debt covenants

.

Certain debt agreements, including those related to our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans, contain financial covenants whose calculations are based on current GAAP.  Our unsecured senior notes payable contain financial covenants that are calculated based on GAAP at the date the bonds were issued.  Our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan agreements provide that our financial debt covenants be renegotiated in good faith to preserve the original intent of the existing financial covenant when such covenant is affected by an accounting standard change.  For those debt agreements that require the renegotiation of financial covenants upon changes in accounting standards, there is no assurance that we will be successful in such negotiations or that the renegotiated covenants will not be more restrictive to us.

Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented.

The capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption for several years.  In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial and/or operating strength.  If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to capital from financial institutions on favorable terms, or altogether, and our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities could be adversely affected by causes beyond our control through ongoing extraordinary disruptions in the global economy and financial systems or other events.

We may not be able to obtain additional capital to further our business objectives.

Our ability to acquire, develop, or redevelop properties depends upon our ability to obtain capital.  The real estate industry has recently experienced volatile debt and equity capital markets with periods of extreme illiquidity.  A prolonged period in which we cannot effectively access the public equity or debt markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing sources to undertake new investments.  An inability to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from acquiring, financing, and completing desirable investments, and could otherwise adversely affect our business.  Also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or interests in subsidiaries to fund future operations could dilute the ownership of our then-existing stockholders.  Even as liquidity returns to the market, debt and equity capital may be more expensive than in prior years.

Possible future sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect its market price.

We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of shares of our common stock on the market price of our common stock from time to time.  Sales of substantial amounts of capital stock (including the conversion or redemption of preferred stock), or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.

We have reserved a number of shares of common stock for issuance to our directors, officers, and employees pursuant to our Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (sometimes referred to herein as our equity incentive plan).  We have filed a registration statement with respect to the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to grants under our equity incentive plan.  In addition, any shares issued under our equity incentive plan will be available for sale in the public market from time to time without restriction by persons who are not our “affiliates” (as defined in Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act).  Affiliates will be able to sell shares of our common stock subject to restrictions under Rule 144.


The price per share of our stock may fluctuate significantly.

The market price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including, but not limited to:

Ÿ

The availability and cost of debt and/or equity capital;

Ÿ

The condition of our balance sheet;

Ÿ

Actual or anticipated capital requirements;

Ÿ

The condition of the financial and banking industries;

Ÿ

Actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends;

Ÿ

The amount and timing of debt maturities and other contractual obligations;

Ÿ

Changes in our funds from operations (“FFO”), adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”), or earnings estimates;

Ÿ

The publication of research reports about us, the real estate industry, or the life science industry;

Ÿ

The general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other debt or equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate-based companies);

Ÿ

General stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;

Ÿ

Changes in our analyst ratings;

Ÿ

Changes in our corporate credit rating or credit ratings of our debt or other securities;

Ÿ

Changes in market valuations of similar companies;

Ÿ

Adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;

Ÿ

Additions or departures of key management personnel;

Ÿ

Actions by institutional stockholders;

Ÿ

Speculation in the press or investment community;

Ÿ

Terrorist activity adversely affecting the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending;

Ÿ

Government regulatory action and changes in tax laws;

Ÿ

The realization of any of the other risk factors included in this annual report on Form 10-K; and

Ÿ

General market and economic conditions.

Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control.  These factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects.

Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.

Our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.  This may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited to:

Ÿ

The status of the economy;

Ÿ

The status of capital markets, including availability and cost of capital;

Ÿ

Changes in financing terms available to us;

Ÿ

Negative developments in the operating results or financial condition of client tenants, including, but not limited to, their ability to pay rent;

Ÿ

Our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies occur;

Ÿ

Our ability to reinvest sale proceeds in a timely manner at rates similar to those of assets sold;

Ÿ

Regulatory approval and market acceptance of the products and technologies of life science client tenants;

Ÿ

Liability or contract claims by or against client tenants;

Ÿ

Unanticipated difficulties and/or expenditures relating to future acquisitions;

Ÿ

Environmental laws affecting our properties;

Ÿ

Changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting; and

Ÿ

Other legal and operational matters, including REIT qualification and key management personnel recruitment and retention.

Failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to FFO per share, AFFO per share, earnings estimates, operating cash flows, and revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our common stock or other outstanding securities.


Our debt service obligations may have adverse consequences on our business operations.

We use debt to finance our operations, including the acquisition, development, and redevelopment of properties.  Our use of debt may have adverse consequences, including the following:

Ÿ

Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest;

Ÿ

We may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on our debt;

Ÿ

We may default on our debt obligations, and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure those loans;

Ÿ

A foreclosure on one of our properties could create taxable income without any accompanying cash proceeds to pay the tax;

Ÿ

A default under a mortgage loan that has cross-default provisions may cause us to automatically default on another loan;

Ÿ

We may not be able to refinance or extend our existing debt;

Ÿ

The terms of any refinancing or extension may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt;

Ÿ

We may be subject to a significant increase in the variable interest rates on our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans and certain other borrowings, which could adversely impact our cash flows and operations; and

Ÿ

The terms of our debt obligations may require a reduction in our distributions to stockholders.

We may not be able to refinance our debt and/or our debt may not be assumable.

Due to the high volume of real estate debt financing in recent years, the real estate industry may require more funds to refinance debt maturities than are available from lenders.  This potential shortage of available funds from lenders and stricter credit underwriting guidelines may limit our ability to refinance our debt as it matures, our cash flows, or our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or may adversely affect our financial condition, our results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing ability.

Our credit ratings may affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event that our current credit ratings are downgraded or removed, we would most likely incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty in obtaining additional financing, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

We may not be able to borrow additional amounts through the issuance of unsecured bonds.

There is no assurance that we will be able to access the investment-grade unsecured bond market on favorable terms while we maintain our investment-grade ratings.  Our ability to borrow additional amounts through the issuance of unsecured bonds may be negatively impacted by periods of illiquidity in the bond market.  Our inability to borrow additional amounts through the issuance of unsecured bonds will require us to borrow under other arrangements and could delay or prevent us from acquiring, financing, and completing desirable investments, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, ability to make distributions to our stockholders, financial condition, and results of operations.


We may not be able to borrow additional amounts under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans.

Aggregate unsecured borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans are limited to an amount based primarily on the net operating income (“NOI”) derived from a pool of unencumbered properties and the cost basis of certain of our land and construction projects and compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants.  Borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans are funded by a group of banks.  Our ability to borrow additional amounts under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans may be negatively impacted by a decrease in cash flows from our properties, a default or cross-default under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans, non-compliance with one or more loan covenants, and non-performance or failure of one or more lenders under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans.  In addition, we may not be able to refinance or repay outstanding borrowings on our unsecured senior line of credit or unsecured senior bank term loans.  Our inability to borrow additional amounts could delay or prevent us from acquiring, financing, and completing desirable investments, which could adversely affect our business; and our inability to refinance or repay amounts under our unsecured senior line of credit or unsecured senior bank term loans may adversely affect our cash flows, ability to make distributions to our stockholders, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans restrict our ability to engage in some business activities.

Our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans contain customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that, among other things:

Ÿ

Restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;

Ÿ

Restrict our ability to make certain investments;

Ÿ

Restrict our ability to merge with another company;

Ÿ

Restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders;

Ÿ

Require us to maintain financial coverage ratios; and

Ÿ

Require us to maintain a pool of unencumbered assets approved by the lenders.

These restrictions could cause us to default on our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans or could negatively affect our operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

We could become highly leveraged, and our debt service obligations could increase.

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur.  Therefore, we could become highly leveraged.  This would result in an increase in our debt service obligations that could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.  Higher leverage could also increase the risk of default on our debt obligations.

If interest rates rise, our debt service costs will increase and the value of our properties may decrease.

Our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and certain other borrowings bear interest at variable rates, and we may incur additional debt in the future.  Increases in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt.  Additionally, increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and decrease the market price of our common stock.  Accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.

The interest rate hedge agreements we use to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements.  In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.  These risk factors may lead to failure to hedge effectively against changes in interest rates and therefore may adversely affect our results of operations.


The adoption of derivatives legislation by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.

The Dodd-Frank Act regulates derivative transactions, which include certain instruments used in our risk management activities.  The Dodd-Frank Act contemplates that most swaps will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility.  There are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk.  While we may ultimately be eligible for such exceptions, the scope of these exceptions is currently uncertain, pending further definition through rule-making proceedings.  Among the other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may affect derivative transactions are those relating to establishment of capital and margin requirements for certain derivative participants; establishment of business conduct standards, recordkeeping requirements, and reporting requirements; and imposition of position limits.  Although the Dodd-Frank Act includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives, the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until all regulations have been adopted by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The new legislation and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of hedge counterparties available to us.

The conversion rights of our convertible preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock.

As of December 31, 2013, we had $250.0 million outstanding of our 7.00% series D cumulative convertible preferred stock (“Series D Convertible Preferred Stock”).  Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions.  As of December 31, 2013, the conversion rate for the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock was 0.2480 shares of our common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $100.81 per share of common stock.  The conversion rate for the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.78 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock.  In addition, we may, at our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically converted if the closing sale price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds 150% of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to our issuance of a press release announcing the exercise of our conversion option.  Holders of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their outstanding shares.

The conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into our common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in our company, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.  Any adjustments that increase the conversion rate of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock would increase their dilutive effect.  Further, the conversion rights by the holders of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock might be triggered in situations in which we need to conserve our cash reserves, in which event, our election, under certain conditions, to repurchase such Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in lieu of converting it into common stock might adversely affect us and our stockholders.

We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures.

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in non-wholly owned partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint ventures.  Partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture investments involve certain risks, including, but not limited to:

Ÿ

Upon bankruptcy of non-wholly owned partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint venture entities, we may become liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture;

Ÿ

We may share certain approval rights over major decisions with third parties;

Ÿ

We may be required to contribute additional capital if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions;

Ÿ

Our partners, co-members, or joint ventures might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and that could affect our ability to operate the property or our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT;

Ÿ

Our ability to sell the interest on advantageous terms when we so desire may be limited or restricted under the terms of our agreements with our partners; and

Ÿ

We may not continue to own or operate the interests or assets underlying such relationships or may need to purchase such interests or assets at an above market price to continue ownership.


We generally seek to maintain control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures sufficient to permit us to achieve our business objectives.  However, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, or ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or the market price of our common stock.

We may not be able to sell our properties quickly to raise money.

Investments in real estate are relatively illiquid compared to other investments.  Accordingly, we may not be able to sell our properties when we desire or at prices acceptable to us in response to changes in economic or other conditions.  In addition, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”) limits our ability to sell properties held for less than two years.  These limitations on our ability to sell our properties may adversely affect our cash flows, our ability to repay debt, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

If our revenues are less than our expenses, we may have to borrow additional funds, and we may not be able to make distributions to our stockholders.

If our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including our debt service obligations and capital expenditures, we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and cash flow needs.  This could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.  Factors that could adversely affect the revenues we generate from, and the values of, our properties include:

Ÿ

National, local, and worldwide economic conditions;

Ÿ

Competition from other life science properties;

Ÿ

Changes in the life science industry;

Ÿ

Real estate conditions in our target markets;

Ÿ

Our ability to collect rent payments;

Ÿ

The availability of financing;

Ÿ

Changes to the financial and banking industries;

Ÿ

Changes in interest rate levels;

Ÿ

Vacancies at our properties and our ability to re-lease space;

Ÿ

Changes in tax or other regulatory laws;

Ÿ

The costs of compliance with government regulation;

Ÿ

The lack of liquidity of real estate investments; and

Ÿ

Increases in operating costs.

In addition, if a lease at a property is not a triple net lease, we will have greater expenses associated with that property and greater exposure to increases in such expenses.  Significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and insurance, and maintenance costs, are generally fixed and do not decrease when revenues at the related property decrease.

Our distributions to stockholders may decline at any time.

We may not continue our current level of distributions to our stockholders.  Our Board of Directors will determine future distributions based on a number of factors, including:

Ÿ

The amount of cash provided by operating activities available for distribution;

Ÿ

Our financial condition and capital requirements;

Ÿ

Any decision to reinvest funds rather than to distribute such funds;

Ÿ

Our capital expenditures;

Ÿ

The annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;

Ÿ

Restrictions under Maryland law; and

Ÿ

Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.

A reduction in distributions to stockholders may negatively impact our stock price.


Distributions on our common stock may be made in the form of cash, stock, or a combination of both

.

As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders.  Typically, we generate cash for distributions through our operations, the disposition of assets, or the incurrence of additional debt.  Our Board of Directors may determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock.  For example, we may declare dividends payable in cash or stock at the election of each stockholder, subject to a limit on the aggregate cash that could be paid.  Any such dividend would be distributed in a manner intended to count in full toward satisfaction of our annual distribution requirements and to qualify for the dividends paid deduction.  While the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) privately has ruled that such a dividend would so qualify if certain requirements are met, no assurances can be provided that the IRS would not assert a contrary position in the future.  Moreover, a reduction in the cash yield on our common stock may negatively impact our stock price.

We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions and successfully operate acquired properties.

We continually evaluate the market of available properties and may acquire properties when opportunities exist.  Our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully operate them may be exposed to the following significant risks:

Ÿ

We may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including both publicly traded REITs and institutional investment funds;

Ÿ

Even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price or result in other less favorable terms;

Ÿ

Even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties, these agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction;

Ÿ

We may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

Ÿ

We may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;

Ÿ

We may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of operating properties or portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected;

Ÿ

Acquired properties may be subject to reassessment, which may result in higher-than-expected property tax payments;

Ÿ

Market conditions may result in higher-than-expected vacancy rates and lower-than-expected rental rates; and

Ÿ

We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination; claims by client tenants, vendors, or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties; and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers, and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

If we cannot finance property acquisitions on favorable terms, or operate acquired properties to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to make distributions to our stockholders, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, and the market price of our common stock, could be materially adversely affected.

We may suffer economic harm as a result of making unsuccessful acquisitions in new markets.

We may pursue selective acquisitions of properties in markets where we have not previously owned properties.  These acquisitions may entail risks in addition to those we face in other acquisitions where we are familiar with the markets, such as the risk of not correctly anticipating conditions or trends in a new market and therefore not being able to generate profit from the acquired property.  If this occurs, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, ability to make distributions to our stockholders, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, and the market price of our common stock.

The acquisition of new properties or the development of new properties may give rise to difficulties in predicting revenue potential.

We may continue to acquire additional properties and may seek to develop our existing land holdings strategically as warranted by market conditions.  These acquisitions and developments could fail to perform in accordance with expectations.  If we fail to accurately estimate occupancy levels, lease commencement dates, operating costs, or costs of improvements to bring an acquired property or a development property up to the standards established for our intended market position, the performance of the property may be below expectations.  Acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies affecting their valuation or revenue potential that we have not yet discovered.  We cannot assure our stockholders that the performance of properties acquired or developed by us will increase or be maintained under our management.


We may fail to obtain the financial results expected from development or redevelopment projects.

There are significant risks associated with development and redevelopment projects, including the possibility that:

Ÿ

We may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;

Ÿ

We may be unable to lease development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;

Ÿ

We may expend funds on and devote management’s time to development and redevelopment projects that we may not complete;

Ÿ

We may abandon development or redevelopment projects after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover costs already incurred;

Ÿ

Market and economic conditions may result in lower-than-expected rental rates;

Ÿ

We may face higher operating costs than we anticipated for development or redevelopment projects, including insurance premiums, utilities, real estate taxes, and costs of complying with changes in government regulations;

Ÿ

We may face higher requirements for capital improvements than we anticipated for development or redevelopment projects, particularly in older structures;

Ÿ

We may be unable to proceed with development or redevelopment projects because we cannot obtain debt and/or equity financing on favorable terms or at all;

Ÿ

We may fail to retain tenants that have pre-leased our development or redevelopment projects if we do not complete the construction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants’ specifications;

Ÿ

The bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants that have pre-leased our development or redevelopment projects may adversely affect the income produced by and the value of our properties; or may require us to change the scope of the project, potentially resulting in higher construction costs and lower financial returns;

Ÿ

We may encounter delays, refusals, unforeseen cost increases, and other impairments resulting from third-party litigation or severe weather conditions;

Ÿ

We may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required government permits and authorizations; and

Ÿ

Development or redevelopment projects may have defects we do not discover through our inspection processes, including latent defects that may not reveal themselves until many years after we put a property in service.

The realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.

Improvements to life science properties are significantly more costly than improvements to traditional office space.

Our properties contain infrastructure improvements that are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types.  Although we have historically been able to recover the additional investment in infrastructure improvements through higher rental rates, there is the risk that we will not be able to continue to do so in the future.  Typical improvements include:

Ÿ

Reinforced concrete floors;

Ÿ

Upgraded roof loading capacity;

Ÿ

Increased floor-to-ceiling heights;

Ÿ

Heavy-duty heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) systems;

Ÿ

Enhanced environmental control technology;

Ÿ

Significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and

Ÿ

Laboratory benches.

We could default on leases for land on which some of our properties are located or held for future development.

As of December 31, 2013, we held ground lease obligations that included leases for


properties that accounted for approximately

16%

of our total number of properties and

two

land development parcels.  Excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in


with a net book value of approximately

$8.9 million

at December 31, 2013, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms generally ranging from


to


years, including extension options.  If we default under the terms of any particular ground lease, we may lose the ownership rights to the property subject to the lease.  Upon expiration of a ground lease and all of its options, we may not be able to renegotiate a new lease on favorable terms, if at all.  The loss of the ownership rights to these properties or an increase of rental expense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders, as well as the market price of our common stock.


We may not be able to operate properties successfully.

Our success depends in large part upon our ability to operate our properties successfully.  If we are unable to do so, our business could be adversely affected.  The ownership and operation of real estate is subject to many risks that may adversely affect our business and our ability to make payments to our stockholders, including the risks that:

Ÿ

Our properties may not perform as we expect;

Ÿ

We may have to lease space at rates below our expectations;

Ÿ

We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms; and

Ÿ

We may underestimate the cost of improvements required to maintain or improve space to meet standards established for the market position intended for that property.

If we encounter any of these risks, our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.

We may experience increased operating costs, which may reduce profitability.

Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses including insurance, property taxes, utilities, administrative costs, and other costs associated with security, landscaping, and repairs and maintenance of our properties.  As of December 31, 2013, approximately

94%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.  However, we cannot be certain that our client tenants will be able to bear the full burden of these higher costs, or that such increased costs will not lead them, or other prospective client tenants, to seek space elsewhere.  If operating expenses increase, the availability of other comparable space in the markets we operate in may hinder or limit our ability to increase our rents; if operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

In order to maintain the quality of our properties and successfully compete against other properties, we must periodically spend money to maintain, repair, and renovate our properties, which reduces our cash flows.

If our properties are not as attractive to current and prospective client tenants in terms of rent, services, condition, or location as properties owned by our competitors, we

could lose client tenants or suffer lower rental rates.  As a result, we may from time to time be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain the competitiveness of our

properties.  However, there can be no assurances that any such expenditures would result in higher occupancy or higher rental rates, or deter existing client tenants from relocating to properties

owned by our competitors.

We face substantial competition in our target markets.

The significant competition for business in our target markets could have an adverse effect on our operations.  We compete for investment opportunities with:

Ÿ

Other REITs;

Ÿ

Insurance companies;

Ÿ

Pension and investment funds;

Ÿ

Private equity entities;

Ÿ

Partnerships;

Ÿ

Developers;

Ÿ

Investment companies; and

Ÿ

Owners/occupants.

Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more than we can or accept more risk than we are willing to accept.  These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a client tenant or the geographic concentration of their investments.  Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.


Poor economic conditions in our markets could adversely affect our business.

Our properties are primarily located in the following markets:

Ÿ

Greater Boston;

Ÿ

San Francisco Bay Area;

Ÿ

San Diego;

Ÿ

Greater New York City;

Ÿ

Maryland;

Ÿ

Seattle;

Ÿ

Research Triangle Park; and

Ÿ

Canada.

As a result of our geographic concentration, we depend upon the local economic and real estate conditions in these markets.  We are, therefore, subject to increased exposure (positive or negative) to economic, tax, and other competitive factors specific to markets in confined geographic areas.  Our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these markets.  An economic downturn in any of these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.  We cannot assure our stockholders that these markets will continue to grow or remain favorable to the life science industry.

We are dependent on the life science industry, and changes within the industry may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations.

In general, our business strategy is to invest primarily in properties used by client tenants in the life science industry.  Our business could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic, financial, or banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the U.S. to other countries.  Because of our industry focus, events within the life science industry may have a more pronounced effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders than if we had more diversified investments.  Also, some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry client tenant and could require modification before we are able to re-lease vacant space to another life science industry client tenant.  Generally, our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office client tenants without significant expenditures on renovations.

Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed.

Many life science entities have completed mergers or consolidations.  Mergers or consolidations of life science entities in the future could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants, which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations.

Our inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire may significantly affect our business.

Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases.  If a client tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely payments under its lease.  Also, if our client tenants terminate early or decide not to renew their leases, we may not be able to re-lease the space.  Even if client tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions, and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms.  Consequently, we could generate less cash flow from the affected properties than expected, which could negatively impact our business.  We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our debt service payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected properties.


Our life science industry client tenants are subject to a number of risks unique to the life science industry, including (i) high levels of regulation, (ii) failures in the safety and efficacy of their products, (iii) significant funding requirements for product research and development, and (iv) changes in technology, patent expiration, and intellectual property protection.  These risks, including the following, may adversely affect their ability to make rental payments to us or satisfy their other lease obligations, and consequently, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.

High levels of regulation

Ÿ

Drugs that are developed and manufactured by some of our client tenants require regulatory approval, including the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), prior to being made, marketed, sold, and used. The regulatory approval process to manufacture and market drugs is costly, typically takes several years, requires validation through clinical trials and the use of substantial resources, and is often unpredictable. A client tenant may fail to obtain or may experience significant delays in obtaining these approvals.  Even if the client tenant obtains regulatory approvals, marketed products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review and potential loss of approvals.

Ÿ

The ability of some of our client tenants to commercialize any future products successfully will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by government authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payers.  Additionally, reimbursements may decrease in the future.

Failures in the safety and efficacy of their products

Ÿ

Some of our client tenants developing potential products may find that their products are not effective, or even are harmful, when tested in humans.

Ÿ

Some of our client tenants are dependent upon the commercial success of certain products.  Even if a product made by a client tenant is successfully developed and proven safe and effective in human clinical trials, and the requisite regulatory approvals are obtained, subsequent discovery of safety issues with these products could cause product liability events, additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, loss of approval, withdrawal of products from the market, and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties.

Ÿ

A drug made by a client tenant may not be well accepted by doctors and patients, or may be less effective or accepted than a competitor’s drug, even if it is successfully developed.

Ÿ

The negative results of safety signals arising from the clinical trials of the competitors of our client tenants may prompt regulatory agencies to take actions that may adversely affect the clinical trials or products of our client tenants.

Significant funding requirements for product research and development

Ÿ

Some of our client tenants require significant funding to develop and commercialize their products and technologies, which funding must be obtained from venture capital firms; private investors; the public markets; companies in the life science industry; or federal, state, and local governments. Such funding may become unavailable or difficult to obtain. The ability of each client tenant to raise capital will depend on its financial and operating condition and the overall condition of the financial, banking, and economic environment.

Ÿ

Even with sufficient funding, some of our client tenants may not be able to discover or identify potential drug targets in humans, or potential drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or technologies that are commercially useful in the discovery or identification of potential drug targets or drugs.

Ÿ

Some of our client tenants may not be able to successfully manufacture their drugs economically, even if such drugs are proven through human clinical trials to be safe and effective in humans.

Ÿ

Marketed products also face commercialization risk, and client tenants may never realize projected levels of product utilization or revenues.

Ÿ

Negative news regarding the products, the clinical trials, or other business developments of our client tenants may cause their stock price or credit profile to deteriorate.


Changes in technology, patent expiration, and intellectual property protection

Ÿ

Our client tenants sell products and services in an industry that is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, evolving industry standards, and uncertainty over the implementation of new healthcare reform legislation, which may cause them to lose competitive positions and adversely affect their operations.

Ÿ

Some of our client tenants and their licensors require patent, copyright, or trade secret protection to develop, make, market, and sell their products and technologies. A client tenant may be unable to commercialize its products or technologies if patents covering such products or technologies are not issued, or are successfully challenged, narrowed, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties, or if the client tenant fails to obtain licenses to the discoveries of third parties necessary to commercialize its products or technologies.

We cannot assure our stockholders that our client tenants will be able to develop, make, market, or sell their products and technologies due to the risks inherent in the life science industry. Any client tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above may have difficulty making rental payments to us or satisfying their other lease obligations to us. Such risks may also decrease the credit quality of our client tenants, or cause us to expend more funds and resources on the space leased by these client tenants than we originally anticipated.  The increased burden on our resources due to adverse developments relating to our client tenants may cause us to achieve lower-than-expected yields on the space leased by these client tenants.  Negative news relating to our more significant client tenants may also adversely impact our stock price.

Government changes to the healthcare system may have a negative impact on the pricing of drugs, cost of healthcare coverage, and reimbursement of healthcare services and products.

Life science entities are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions.  The FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many critical activities of life science and healthcare industries, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting, and product risk management.  In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of life science industry products depend, in part, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third-party payers, including governments and private health plans.  Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement, and pricing of products to control cost or affect utilization of products.  Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations.  Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the reimbursement by third-party payers of newly approved healthcare products.  The U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect healthcare coverage and costs.  Such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of healthcare services and products.  Government and other regulatory oversight and future regulatory and government interference with the healthcare systems may adversely impact our client tenants’ businesses and our business.

Our results of operations depend on our client tenants’ research and development efforts and their ability to obtain funding for these efforts.

Our client tenant base includes entities in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, life science, and related industries; academic institutions; government institutions; and private foundations.  Our client tenants base their research and development budgets on several factors, including the need to develop new products, the availability of government and other funding, competition, and the general availability of resources.

Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, research priorities, general economic conditions, institutional and government budgetary limitations, and mergers and consolidations of entities in the life science industry.  Our business could be adversely impacted by a significant decrease in life science research and development expenditures by either our client tenants or the life science industry.

Additionally, our client tenants include research institutions whose funding is largely dependent on grants from government agencies such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), the National Science Foundation, and similar agencies or organizations.  Government funding of research and development is subject to the political process, which is often unpredictable.  Other programs, such as Homeland Security or defense, could be viewed by the government as higher priorities.  Additionally, proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the NIH and other government agencies that fund research and development activities.  Any shift away from funding of life science research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may adversely impact our client tenants’ operations, which in turn may impact their ability to make lease payments to us, and thus adversely impact our results of operations.


The inability of a client tenant to pay us rent could adversely affect our business.

Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases.  If our client tenants, especially significant client tenants, fail to make rental payments under their leases, our financial condition, cash flows, and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.

The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major client tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property.  If any of our client tenants becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as amended, we cannot evict that client tenant solely because of its bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court may authorize the client tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us.  Our claim against such a client tenant for uncollectible future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the client tenant’s lease.  Any shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

U.S. government client tenants may not receive government funding, which could hinder their ability to pay us.

U.S. government tenants are subject to government funding.  If one of our U.S. government tenants fails to receive its government funding, we may not be able to collect rental amounts due to us.  In addition, recent budgetary pressures have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities, such as the NIH.  For instance, the NIH budget has been, and may continue to be, significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011 that became effective on March 1, 2013.  Past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced NIH and other research and development budgets.  Any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development, or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals, may cause our client tenants to default on rental payments, or delay or forgo leasing our rental space, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  In addition, defaults under leases with U.S. federal government tenants are governed by federal statute and not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws.  As of December 31, 2013, leases with U.S. government tenants at our properties accounted for approximately

3.6%

of our aggregate ABR.

Some of our client tenants may be subject to increasing government price controls and other healthcare cost-containment measures.

Government healthcare cost-containment measures can significantly affect our client tenants’ revenue and profitability.  In many countries outside the U.S., government agencies strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which our pharmaceutical industry client tenants’ products are sold.  In the U.S., our pharmaceutical industry client tenants are subject to substantial pricing pressures from state Medicaid programs and private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers, and implementation of the recently enacted U.S. healthcare reform legislation is increasing these pricing pressures.  In addition, many state legislative proposals could further negatively affect pricing and/or reimbursement for our pharmaceutical industry client tenants’ products.  We anticipate pricing pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the U.S. to become more severe over time.

We could be held liable for damages resulting from our client tenants’ use of hazardous materials.

Many of our life science industry client tenants engage in research and development activities that involve controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, and biological and radioactive compounds.  In the event of contamination or injury from the use of these hazardous materials, we could be held liable for damages that result.  This liability could exceed our resources and any recovery available through any applicable insurance coverage, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Together with our client tenants, we must comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes in them, could adversely affect our business or our client tenants’ businesses and their ability to make rental payments to us.

Our properties may have defects that are unknown to us.

Although we review the physical condition of our properties before they are acquired, as they are developed and redeveloped, any of our properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could adversely affect the property’s value or revenue potential.


We may incur significant costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws.

Under the ADA, places of public accommodation and/or commercial facilities must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures at our properties to comply with this law.  In addition, non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.

A number of additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations exist regarding access by disabled persons.  These regulations may require modifications to our properties or may affect future renovations.  These expenditures may have an adverse impact on overall returns on our investments.

We may incur significant costs if we fail to comply with laws or if laws change.

Our properties are subject to many federal, state, and local regulatory requirements and to state and local fire, life-safety, and other requirements.  If we do not comply with all of these requirements, we may have to pay fines to government authorities or damage awards to private litigants.  We do not know whether these requirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed.  Changes in these regulatory requirements could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures.  These expenditures could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

We may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws.

Federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations may require us, as a current or prior owner or operator of real estate, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products released at or from any of our properties.  The cost of investigating and cleaning up contamination could be substantial and could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage available to us.  In addition, the presence of contamination, or the failure to properly clean it up, may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell an affected property, or to borrow funds using that property as collateral.

Under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay government entities or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties regardless of whether we knew of or caused the contamination.  Even if more than one party was responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs.  In addition, third parties may sue us for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination, or jointly responsible parties may contest their responsibility or be financially unable to pay their share of such costs.

Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing materials.  These laws may impose fines and penalties on us for the release of asbestos-containing materials and may allow third parties to seek recovery from us for personal injury from exposure to asbestos fibers.  We have detected asbestos-containing materials at some of our properties, but we do not expect that they will result in material environmental costs or liabilities to us.

Environmental laws and regulations also require the removal or upgrading of certain underground storage tanks and regulate:

Ÿ

The discharge of stormwater, wastewater, and any water pollutants;

Ÿ

The emission of air pollutants;

Ÿ

The generation, management, and disposal of hazardous or toxic chemicals, substances, or wastes; and

Ÿ

Workplace health and safety.

Many of our client tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties.  Environmental laws and regulations subject our client tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities.  Environmental liabilities could also affect a client tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us.  We require our client tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us against any related liabilities.

Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental assessments at our properties.  We intend to use consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future acquisitions.  This type of assessment generally includes a site inspection, interviews, and a public records review, but no subsurface sampling.  These assessments and certain additional investigations of our properties have not to date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations.


Additional investigations have included, as appropriate:

Ÿ

Asbestos surveys;

Ÿ

Radon surveys;

Ÿ

Lead surveys;

Ÿ

Mold surveys;

Ÿ

Additional public records review;

Ÿ

Subsurface sampling; and

Ÿ

Other testing.

Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our current properties have not revealed, and that assessments on future acquisitions will not reveal, all environmental liabilities.  Consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware that may result in substantial costs to us or our client tenants and that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs to remedy the problem.

When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold may grow, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time.  Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants.  Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses, and bacteria.  Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions.  As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation.  In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our client tenants, employees of our client tenants, and others if property damage or health concerns arise.

We could incur significant costs due to the financial condition of our insurance carriers.

We insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect.  The financial condition of one or more of the insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, resulting in their inability to pay on future insurance claims.  Their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results.  In addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the cost of renewing our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties.

Our insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses.

If we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not covered by insurance, that exceeds our insurance policy limits, or that is subject to a policy deductible, we could lose the capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues from that property.  In addition, we could continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the affected properties.  We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties.  We have obtained earthquake insurance for our properties that are located in the vicinity of active earthquake faults.  We also carry environmental remediation insurance and have title insurance policies for our properties.  We generally obtain our title insurance policies when we acquire the property; each policy covers an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property.  Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the covered property.

Our client tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive insurance, including liability and casualty insurance that is customarily obtained for similar properties.  There are, however, certain types of losses that we and our client tenants do not generally insure against because they are uninsurable or because it is not economical to insure against them.  The availability of coverage against certain types of losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold, has become more limited and, when available, carries a significantly higher cost.  We cannot predict whether insurance coverage against terrorism or toxic mold will remain available for our properties because insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against such losses, or such coverage, if offered, may become prohibitively expensive.  We have not had material problems with terrorism or toxic mold at any of our properties.


We face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change.

We cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress.  However, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business.  For example, most of our properties are located along the east and west coasts of the U.S.  To the extent that climate change impacts changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels.  Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for laboratory/office space at our properties or result in our inability to operate the buildings at all.  Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy, and increasing the cost of snow removal at our properties.  There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.

Extreme weather or natural disasters may cause property damage or disrupt business, which could harm our business and operating results.

We have properties located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural disasters, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, winds, floods, hurricanes, and fires.  Such conditions may damage our properties, disrupt our operations, and adversely impact our client tenants’ operations.  There can be no assurance that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.

Terrorist attacks may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets.

Terrorist attacks such as those that took place on September 11, 2001, could have a material adverse impact on our business, our operating results, and the market price of our common stock.  Future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties.  To the extent that future terrorist attacks impact our client tenants, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their lease obligations.

The loss of services of any of our senior officers could adversely affect us.

We depend upon the services of relatively few senior officers.  The loss of services of any one of them may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and prospects.  We use the extensive personal and business relationships that members of our management have developed over time with owners of life science properties and with major life science industry client tenants.  We cannot assure our stockholders that our senior officers will remain employed with us.

Competition for skilled personnel could increase labor costs.

We compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel.  We depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company.  Competitive pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel.  We may not be able to offset such additional costs by increasing the rates we charge client tenants.  If there is an increase in these costs or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be taxed at corporate rates and would not be able to take certain deductions when computing our taxable income.

If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify as a REIT:

Ÿ

We would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

Ÿ

We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to our stockholders in computing taxable income;

Ÿ

Unless we were entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification; and

Ÿ

We would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders.

As a result of any additional tax liability, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the applicable tax.  Accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years involved.


Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.  There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions.  Although we believe that we have operated in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure our stockholders that we are or will remain so qualified.

In addition, although we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a REIT, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders.

We may change our business policies without stockholder approval.

Our Board of Directors determines all of our material business policies, with management’s input, including those related to our:

Ÿ

Status as a REIT;

Ÿ

Incurrence of debt and debt management activities;

Ÿ

Selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment activities;

Ÿ

Stockholder distributions; and

Ÿ

Other policies, as appropriate.

Our Board of Directors may amend or revise these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders.  A change in these policies could adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.

Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control.  Changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially harmed, and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price.

Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures, and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may also incur additional significant costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.

There are limits on the ownership of our capital stock under which a stockholder may lose beneficial ownership of its shares and that may delay or prevent transactions that might otherwise be desired by our stockholders.

In order for a company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% of the value of its outstanding stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals or entities (as set forth in the Internal Revenue Code) during the last half of a taxable year.  Furthermore, shares of the company’s outstanding stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year.

In order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other things, our charter provides for an ownership limit, which prohibits, with certain exceptions, direct or constructive ownership of shares of stock representing more than 9.8% of the combined total value of our outstanding shares of stock by any person, as defined in our charter.  Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may waive the ownership limit for any person.  However, our Board of Directors may not grant such waiver if, after giving effect to such waiver, we would be “closely held” under section 856(h) of the Internal Revenue Code.  As a condition to


waiving the ownership limit, our Board of Directors may require a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel in order to determine our status as a REIT.  Notwithstanding the receipt of any such ruling or opinion, our Board of Directors may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with granting a waiver.

Our charter further prohibits transferring shares of our stock if such transfer would result in us being “closely held” under Section 856(h) of the Internal Revenue Code or would result in shares of our stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons.

The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of our common stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity.  A transfer of shares to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates these limits, shall be void, or the shares shall be exchanged for shares of excess stock and transferred to a trust, for the benefit of one or more qualified charitable organizations designated by us.  In that case, the intended transferee will have only a right to share, to the extent of the transferee’s original purchase price for such shares, in proceeds from the trust’s sale of those shares and will effectively forfeit its beneficial ownership of the shares.  These ownership limits could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the holders of our common stock or that might otherwise be desired by such holders.

In addition to the ownership limit, certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that may be deemed to be desirable to our stockholders.

As authorized by Maryland law, our charter allows our Board of Directors to cause us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of common or preferred stock without any stockholder approval.  Our Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that might, for other reasons, be desired by our common stockholders, or a series of preferred stock that has a dividend preference that may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.

Our charter permits the removal of a director only upon a two-thirds majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors, and our bylaws require advance notice of a stockholder’s intention to nominate directors or to present business for consideration by stockholders at an annual meeting of our stockholders.  Our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or change in control that involves a premium price for our common stock or that for other reasons may be desired by our stockholders.

External factors may adversely impact the valuation of investments.

We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry.  The valuation of these investments is affected by many external factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, market prices, market conditions, the effect of healthcare reform legislation, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, the manufacturing and distribution of new products, product safety and efficacy issues, and new collaborative agreements.  Unfavorable developments with respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the valuation of our investments.

We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.

From time to time, we may have significant cash balances that we invest in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income.  These investments may include (either directly or indirectly) obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks, money market funds, treasury bank securities, and other short-term securities.  Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal.  Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of these securities or funds at less than par value.  A decline in the value of our investments or delay or suspension of our right to redeem them may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay our obligations as they become due.


We have certain ownership interests outside the U.S. that may subject us to risks different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations.

We have five operating properties in Canada as well as five operating properties and four development/redevelopment projects in Asia.  Acquisition, development, redevelopment, ownership, and operating activities outside the U.S. involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations.  These risks include, but are not limited to:

Ÿ

Adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;

Ÿ

Challenges and/or taxation with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings or repatriation of proceeds from the sale of one or more of our foreign investments;

Ÿ

Changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions, including regionally, nationally, and locally;

Ÿ

Challenges in managing international operations;

Ÿ

Challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment, and legal proceedings;

Ÿ

Differences in lending practices;

Ÿ

Differences in languages, cultures, and time zones; and

Ÿ

Changes in applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations.

Our foreign investments are subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions based on existing international tax treaties.  We have invested in foreign markets under the assumption that our future earnings in each of those countries will be taxed at the current prevailing income tax rates.  There are no guarantees that foreign governments will continue to honor existing tax treaties which we have relied upon for our foreign investments, or that the current income tax rates will not increase significantly, thus impacting our ability to repatriate our foreign investments and related earnings.

Investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar foreign laws and regulations.  The FCPA and similar applicable anti-corruption laws prohibit individuals and entities from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing, or providing payments or anything of value, directly or indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain, retain, or direct business.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations or the value of our international investments.  In addition, if we fail to effectively manage our international operations, our overall financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow, and the market price of our common stock, could be adversely affected.

Further, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution rules of, another country or region.  In some cases, such a country or region might not have a forum that provides us an effective or efficient means for resolving disputes that may arise under these agreements.

We are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies.

We have properties and operations in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the local currency and we thus are subject to international currency risk from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currency.  A significant decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar, Indian rupee, Chinese renminbi, or other currencies in countries where we may have an investment could materially affect our results of operations.  We may attempt to mitigate such effects by borrowing in the local foreign currency in which we invest.  Any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT.


Security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information technology networks and related systems.

Risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, or other methods, against persons inside our organization, persons with access to systems inside our organization, the U.S. government, financial markets or institutions, or major businesses, including client tenants, could disrupt or disable networks and related systems, other critical infrastructures, and the normal operation of business.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.  Even though we may not be specifically targeted, cyber-attacks on the U.S. government, financial markets, financial institutions, or other major businesses, including client tenants, could disrupt our normal business operations and networks, which may in turn have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations, including managing our building systems.  They also may be critical to the operations of certain of our client tenants.  Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  While, to date, we have not experienced a cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventive measures.  A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could:

Ÿ

Disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our client tenants;

Ÿ

Result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines, and/or missed permitting deadlines;

Ÿ

Result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;

Ÿ

Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation, or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive, or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;

Ÿ

Result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our client tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;

Ÿ

Require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;

Ÿ

Subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties, or termination of leases or other agreements; or

Ÿ

Damage our reputation among our client tenants and investors generally.

Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.

We hold certain instruments in our debt profile on which interest rates move in direct relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of borrowing options.  Beginning in 2008, concerns have been raised that some of the member banks surveyed by the British Bankers’ Association (the “BBA”) in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR across a range of maturities and currencies may have underreported, overreported, or otherwise manipulated the interbank lending rate applicable to them in order to profit on their derivatives positions or to avoid an appearance of capital insufficiency or adverse reputational or other consequences that might have resulted from reporting interbank lending rates higher than those they actually submitted.  A number of BBA member banks have entered into settlements with a number of their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to alleged manipulation of LIBOR, and investigations have been instigated by regulators and government authorities in various jurisdictions.  Other member banks may also enter into such settlements with, or have proceedings brought by, their regulators or law enforcement agencies in the future.  If manipulation of LIBOR occurred, it may have resulted in LIBOR having been artificially lower (or higher) than it would otherwise have been.  Any such manipulation could have occurred over a substantial period of time.


On September 28, 2012, British regulators published a report on the review of LIBOR.  The report concluded that LIBOR should be retained as a benchmark, but recommended a comprehensive reform of LIBOR, including replacing the BBA with a new independent administrator of LIBOR.  Based on this report, final rules for the regulation and supervision of LIBOR by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) were published and came into effect on April 2, 2013 (the “FCA Rules”).  In particular, the FCA Rules include requirements that (1) an independent LIBOR administrator monitor and survey LIBOR submissions to identify breaches of practice standards and/or potentially manipulative behavior, and (2) firms submitting data to LIBOR establish and maintain a clear conflicts-of-interest policy and appropriate systems and controls.  On July 9, 2013, it was reported that NYSE Euronext had been awarded the contract to administer LIBOR beginning in 2014.  It is not possible to predict the effect of the FCA Rules, any changes in the methods pursuant to which LIBOR is determined, the administration of LIBOR by NYSE Euronext, and any other reforms to LIBOR that will be enacted in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  In addition, any changes announced by the FCA, the BBA, or any other successor governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to which LIBOR is determined, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the level of the index.  Fluctuation or discontinuation of LIBOR would affect our interest expense and earnings and the fair value of certain of our financial instruments.  We rely on interest rate swaps to help mitigate our exposure to such interest rate risk, on a portion of our debt obligations.  However, there is no assurance these arrangements will be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

General

As of

December 31, 2013

, we had


properties containing approximately

17.5 million

RSF of laboratory/office space.  The occupancy percentage of our operating properties was approximately

94.4%

as of

December 31, 2013

.  The exteriors of our properties typically resemble traditional office properties, but the interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science industry client tenants.  These improvements typically are generic to life science industry client tenants rather than being specific to a particular client tenant.  As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of life science industry client tenants.  Laboratory improvements to our life science properties typically include:

Ÿ

Reinforced concrete floors;

Ÿ

Upgraded roof loading capacity;

Ÿ

Increased floor-to-ceiling heights;

Ÿ

Heavy-duty HVAC systems;

Ÿ

Enhanced environmental control technology;

Ÿ

Significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and

Ÿ

Laboratory benches.

As of

December 31, 2013

, we held a fee simple interest in each of our properties, except for


properties that accounted for approximately

16%

of our total number of properties.  Of the


properties, we held


properties in the Greater Boston market,

five

properties in the San Francisco Bay Area market,

two

properties in the San Diego market,

two

properties in the Greater New York City market,

one

property in the Maryland market,

one

property in the Research Triangle Park market, and

four

properties in the International market pursuant to ground leasehold interests.  As of

December 31, 2013

, our asset base also contained

two

land parcels aggregating approximately

1.6 million

developable square feet in India, which we held pursuant to ground leasehold interests.  See further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”

As of

December 31, 2013

, we had


leases with a total of


client tenants, and


, or

43.9%

, of our


properties were single-tenant properties.  Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have terms of

four

to


years, while the single-tenant building leases typically have terms of

eight

to


years.  As of

December 31, 2013

:

Ÿ

Investment-grade client tenants represented

51%

of our total ABR;

Ÿ

Approximately

94%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent;

Ÿ

Approximately

95%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from

3%

to

3.5%

) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and

Ÿ

Approximately

92%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.

Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property.  Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the properties are reusable generic laboratory/office improvements and remain our property after termination of the lease at our election.  However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that the client tenant, at its expense, remove certain non-generic improvements and restore the premises to its original condition.

LEED Certifications

We strive to maximize the environmental efficiency of our properties.  We closely manage the different development, redevelopment, and operating stages of many of our properties, from design and construction to maintenance of the life cycle of our buildings to achieve environmentally responsible and resource-efficient assets.  The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) set of rating systems developed by the U.S. Green Building Council allows building owners to measure this efficiency. During 2013, we obtained LEED Gold certifications at seven projects.  As of

December 31, 2013

, our asset base had 25 LEED Certified projects, including two LEED Platinum projects, 16 LEED Gold projects, and seven LEED Silver projects.  Upon completion of an additional 21 in-process certifications, 50% of the total RSF (continuing operations) will be LEED Certified.


Location of properties

The locations of our properties are diversified among a number of top life science cluster submarkets.  The following table sets forth, as of

December 31, 2013

, the total RSF and ABR of our properties in each of our existing markets (dollars in thousands):

(dollars in thousands):

(1)

The book value for this unconsolidated joint venture represents our equity investment in the 360 Longwood Avenue project located in the Greater Boston market.

Current value-creation development and redevelopment projects

A key component of our business model is our value-creation development and redevelopment programs.  These programs are focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable laboratory/office space to meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of client tenants in the life science industry.  Upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate significant revenues and cash flows.  Our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to life science entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, and higher rental income and returns.

Development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable laboratory/office facilities.  Redevelopment projects generally consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into generic and reusable laboratory/office space.  We anticipate execution of new development projects for aboveground vertical construction of new laboratory/office space generally with significant pre-leasing.  We may commence predevelopment activities, including entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities, prior to commencement of vertical construction of aboveground shell and core improvements.  Our objective with predevelopment efforts is to reduce the time required to deliver projects to prospective client tenants.  These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings.  Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities for the life science industry and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows for the Company.


Our initial stabilized yield is calculated as the quotient of the estimated amount of NOI and our investment in the property.  Our initial stabilized yield excludes the impact of leverage.  Our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are expected to increase over time and our average cash yields are expected, in general, to be greater than our initial stabilized yields on a cash basis.  Our estimates for initial cash and GAAP yields, and total costs at completion, represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project.  Initial stabilized yield – cash basis reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed.  Initial stabilized yield – GAAP basis reflects cash rents, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.  Average cash yield reflects cash rents, including contractual rent escalations after initial rental concessions have elapsed, calculated on a straight-line basis.


The following table provides details on our development and redevelopment projects located in North America as of

In the third quarter of 2013, we completed the preliminary design and budget for interior improvements for use by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“ARIAD”).  Based upon our lease with ARIAD, we expected an increase in both estimated NOI and estimated cost at completion, with no significant change in our estimated yields.  We expect to finalize the design and budget for the interior improvements in the future and will provide an update on our estimated cost at completion and targeted yields.

PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “ARE.”  On

February 20, 2014

, the last reported sales price per share of our common stock was $72.09, and there were approximately 271 holders of record of our common stock (excluding beneficial owners whose shares are held in the name of Cede & Co.).  The following table sets forth the quarterly high and low trading prices per share of our common stock as reported on the NYSE and the distributions declared by us with respect to our common stock for each such period (distributions were paid in the quarter following the quarter in which the distribution was declared):

Future distributions on our common stock will be determined by and at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, restrictions under Maryland law, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.  To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income for the current taxable year, determined without regard to deductions for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains.  Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash flow available for distributions to meet these distribution requirements.  In such a case, we may borrow funds or may raise funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity capital.  No dividends can be paid on our common stock unless we have paid full cumulative dividends on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and our series E preferred stock (“Series E Preferred Stock”).  From the date of issuance of our preferred stock through December 31, 2013, we have paid full cumulative dividends on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock.  We cannot assure our stockholders that we will make any future distributions.

The income tax treatment of distributions on our common stock, series C preferred stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”), Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and Series E Preferred Stock for the years ended

December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

, was as follows:

, we are known for our high-quality and diverse client tenant base, which includes renowned academic and medical institutions, multinational pharmaceutical companies, public and private biotechnology entities, United States government research agencies, medical device companies, industrial biotech companies, venture capital firms, and life science product and service companies.  We have a proven and superior track record developing Class A laboratory/office assets focused primarily in key urban science center campus locations in AAA cluster locations adjacent to leading academic medical research centers, offering highly creative amenities that drive client tenant productivity and foster innovation, and cultivating our longstanding and expansive network in the life science community.  We believe these advantages result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.

Our average occupancy rate of operating properties as of December 31 of each year from 2000 to 2013 was approximately

94.9%

.  Our average occupancy rate of operating and redevelopment properties as of December 31 of each year from 2000 to 2013 was approximately

89.1%

.  Investment-grade client tenants represented

51%

of our total ABR as of December 31, 2013.

Executive Summary

Our per share results for the year ended December 31, 2013, reflected (i) the strength of our core operations, (ii) completion of significant high-value Class A development projects in AAA locations in urban science and technology cluster markets, and (iii) the completion of many significant and important improvements in our long-term capital structure.  Monetization of significant non-income-producing land parcels (Alexandria Center™ for Science and Technology, located in Mission Bay, Alexandria Center™ at Kendall Square, located in Cambridge, and Alexandria Center™ for Life Science - New York City) through lease-up and development, and through selective sales, has generated significant long-term asset value.  In 2012 and 2013, we sold certain non-strategic income-producing assets and land for approximately $275 million.  Proceeds from these sales, including $55 million from the sale of a land parcel in late 2013, were invested into high-value Class A development projects with an estimated projected value of approximately $450 million, representing a projected increase of almost $175 million above the value of the properties sold.  We are also pleased with the successful execution of our second 10-year unsecured bond offering in early 2013 at a rate of 3.90%.  The capital generated from the sales of properties and issuance of long-term debt and common stock improved our long-term capital structure, and funded our Class A developments, among others, at Alexandria Center™ at Kendall Square located in Cambridge, but resulted in short-term per share dilution.  We are optimistic about our ability to deliver solid and stable per share earnings growth and continue to increase long-term asset value in 2014 and beyond.


The equity capital market for the year ended December 31, 2013, was extremely strong for biotech and pharmaceutical companies, with 46 U.S. biotech companies pricing initial public offerings, the most in over 13 years.  More important to us, these companies have continued the strong focus of performing mission-critical research in key intellectual centers where we own laboratory/office facilities, and we benefited greatly by that trend.

Our same property NOI growth for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, was solid, up

$17.3 million

, or

5.4%

, on a cash basis, and up

$6.0 million

, or

1.8%

, on a GAAP basis compared to the year ended

December 31, 2012

.  Our cash basis performance for


was driven primarily by our favorable lease structure.  As of

December 31, 2013

,

95%

of our existing leases contained annual contractual steps in rent, and

94%

of our leases were triple net, wherein tenants reimburse us for all or a majority of the operating expenses of the property.  Our same property performance also benefited from strong leasing performance in


, with increases on average in rental rates upon renewal or re-leasing of space and an increase in overall occupancy percentage.

Our non-same property NOI growth for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, was also very strong, up

$34.4 million

, or

55.8%

, compared to the year ended

December 31, 2012

.  Our non-same property performance for 2013 was driven primarily by our key value-creation project deliveries and lease-up of temporary vacant space.  We delivered a significant portion of our value

-

creation pipeline during the year with a major milestone in December, including, among others, the initial delivery of

45%

of our second Class A laboratory/office building in New York City to Roche and New York University, among others, and the delivery in September 2013 of our

305,212

RSF development project at 225 Binney Street in the Cambridge submarket of Greater Boston that was 100% leased to Biogen Idec.

Our leasing activity reached a new record level with a total of


leases aggregating

3.6 million

RSF executed in


.  Our rental rates increased

4.0%

and

16.2%

on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively, on renewed/re-leased space during


.  The occupancy percentage for our operating and redevelopment properties in North America increased by 390 basis points to 95.5% at

December 31, 2013

, compared to 91.6% at

December 31, 2012

.

In December 2013, we completed the sale of our final land parcel in the Mission Bay submarket of the San Francisco Bay Area at 1600 Owens Street, along with certain parking spaces, for an aggregate sales price of

$55.2 million

.  The delivery of completed development and redevelopment projects, combined with the sale of land parcels in 2013, allowed us to decrease our non-income-producing assets (CIP and land) as a percentage of gross investments in real estate by 600 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2013.

We achieved many of the long-term components of our capital strategy in 2013, including a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 6.6 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.2 times for the fourth quarter of 2013 on an annualized basis; completed the successful offering of $500 million of 10-year unsecured senior notes at 3.90% (“3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes”); reduced our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of gross investments in real estate to 17% as of December 31, 2013, compared to 23% as of December 31, 2012, due to the deliveries of value-creation development and redevelopment projects and land sales.

The buildings are currently undergoing redevelopment, see development and redevelopment table above.

On January 30, 2014, we acquired 3545 Cray Court, a 116,556 RSF laboratory/office property located in the Torrey Pines submarket of San Diego, for a total purchase price of $64.0 million.  The property is currently 100% occupied by The Scripps Research Institute.  The estimated initial stabilized yields for this property are 7.0% and 7.2%, on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively.  In connection with the acquisition, we assumed a $40.7 million non-recourse secured note payable with a contractual interest rate of 4.66% and a maturity date of January 2023.

Dispositions

During the

year ended December 31, 2013

, we sold seven income-producing assets for an aggregate sales price of

$128.6 million

, aggregating 826,824 RSF located primarily in the suburban markets of Seattle, Maryland, Greater New York City, and Greater Boston.  In addition, we completed the sale of

four

parcels of land for an aggregate sales price of

$73.3 million

, which included the sale of our final land parcel in the Mission Bay submarket of the San Francisco Bay Area, at 1600 Owens Street, for an aggregate sales price of

$55.2 million

.


Balance sheet

Over the past several years, we successfully completed important steps in order to improve our long-term capital structure and our credit profile.  We have a solid balance sheet that will allow us to deliver stable growth in per share earnings and net asset value.

We expect to continue the transition of our balance sheet debt from short-term and medium-term bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed-rate debt over the next several years.  However, some bank debt will remain a component of our long-term capital structure, primarily consisting of an unsecured senior line of credit for liquidity and flexibility, and if appropriate, unsecured senior bank term loans.  The transition from unhedged variable-rate bank debt to longer-term fixed-rate debt is expected to result in an increase in our interest costs.  Growth in earnings from core operations and completion of Class A development projects is expected to generate growth in per share earnings and FFO, even after consideration of projected increases in interest expense related to refinancing outstanding variable-rate bank debt.  Our capital structure will also continue to benefit from longer and laddered debt maturities, less LIBOR-based variable interest rate risk, and continued access to diverse sources of capital.  While this transition from unhedged variable-rate bank debt is in process, we expect to utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate risk.  We expect to keep our unhedged variable-rate debt at approximately 30% or less of our total debt over the short to medium term.  The transition of unhedged variable-rate bank debt to longer-term fixed-rate unsecured bonds is not expected to impact the “highly effective” designation of the existing interest rate swap agreements as of

December 31, 2013

.  Our forecasts assume outstanding unhedged variable-rate debt in an amount at least equal to our effective notional amount of interest rate swap agreements in effect at any point in time.

Secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small portion of our capital structure, and we may utilize secured construction loans for our value-creation development projects from time to time.  We believe perpetual preferred stock should remain as a component of our long-term capital structure.

As of

December 31, 2013

, we had four properties held for sale with an aggregate net book value of

$7.5 million

.  We may identify additional properties for potential sale in 2014 and thereafter.

As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

17%

of our gross real estate represented non-income-producing assets (CIP and land).  Our current development and redevelopment projects represented

8%

of our gross investments in real estate, a significant amount of which is pre-leased and expected to be delivered over the next two to eight quarters.  The completion and delivery of these projects will significantly reduce our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of gross investments in real estate.  Over the next few years, we may also identify certain land parcels for potential sale.  Our medium-term target is to reduce non-income-producing assets (CIP and land) as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate to 10%.

The chart below shows the historical trend of non-income-producing assets as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate:


Execution of capital strategy in 2013

During 2013, we achieved many of the long-term components of our capital strategy intended to provide a solid and flexible capital structure that enables stable and consistent future growth, highlighted by the following key accomplishments:

•

Improved our key credit metric ratios forecasted, including net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 6.6 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.2 times for the fourth quarter of 2013 on an annualized basis;

•

Reduced our non-income-producing assets (CIP and land) to 17% of our gross investment in real estate as of December 31, 2013, compared to 23% as of December 31, 2012, due to the deliveries of value-creation development and redevelopment projects and completed land sales;

•

Reduced our variable-rate bank debt by approximately $612 million;

•

Completed the successful offering of $500 million of 10-year unsecured senior notes at 3.90%; extended average remaining term of outstanding debt to 5.3 years;

•

Completed a $536 million common stock equity offering at $73.50 per share;

•

Maintained significant liquidity of approximately $1.65 billion, consisting of $1.30 billion available under our unsecured senior line of credit, $295 million available under our construction loan commitments, and $58 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2013;

•

Extended the maturity of a $76 million secured note payable from April 2014 to January 2017; and

•

Executed additional interest rate swap agreements to provide a minimum of hedged variable-rate debt of $750 million in 2014 and $500 million in both 2015 and 2016.

Results of operations

As a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented in the table in “Comparison of the Year Ended

December 31, 2013

, to the Year Ended

December 31, 2012

” shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period.  In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations, we analyze the operating performance for all properties that were fully operating for the entire periods presented (“Same Properties”) separate from properties acquired subsequent to the beginning of the earliest period presented, properties currently undergoing development or redevelopment, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from Same Property results (“Non-Same Properties”).  Additionally, rental revenues from lease termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of the Same Properties.

The following table presents information regarding our Same Properties as of

December 31, 2013

and

The following table reconciles Same Properties to total properties for the year ended

NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, before loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of land parcel, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and general and administrative expense.  We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level.  Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.  NOI on a cash basis is NOI on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent adjustments required by GAAP.  We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent adjustments to rental revenue.

The chart below shows our NOI for the years ended December 31, 2011, through December 31, 2013 (in millions):


Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure, because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations.  NOI excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties.  For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level.  In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level.  Real estate impairments have been excluded in deriving NOI because we do not consider impairment losses to be property-level operating expenses.  Real estate impairment losses relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses.  Our real estate impairments represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell.  These impairments result from investing decisions and the deterioration in market conditions that adversely impact underlying real estate values.  Our calculation of NOI also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to the timing of corporate strategy.  Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities; repairs and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries.  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management, and are excluded from NOI because they represent the ownership structure we have, and are not necessarily linked to the operating performance of our properties.  NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other equity REITs that define NOI differently.  We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statements of income.  NOI should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or a measure of our ability to make distributions.

The following table presents a comparison of the components of NOI for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, compared to the year ended

December 31, 2012

, and a reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure (dollars in thousands):


Rental revenues

Total rental revenues for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, increased by

$45.0 million

, or

10.6%

, to

$467.8 million

, compared to

$422.8 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including


development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2012, and

five

operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2012.  In addition, rental revenues from our Same Properties increased by

$8.5 million

.  Occupancy of Same Properties increased 80 basis points, to

93.5%

as of December 31, 2013, from

92.7%

as of December 31, 2012.

Tenant recoveries

Tenant recoveries for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, increased by

$16.8 million

, or

12.6%

, to

$150.1 million

, compared to

$133.3 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  This increase is consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses of

$16.3 million

.  Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by

$3.9 million

primarily as a result of an increase in Same Properties rental operating expenses of

$6.4 million

and higher occupancy for these properties in 2013.  Rental operating expenses increased during the

year ended December 31, 2013

, compared to the

year ended December 31, 2012

, primarily due to an increase in operating costs related to colder weather in 2013, property tax rate increases for our properties located in Massachusetts, an increase in repairs and maintenance projects completed in 2013 compared to 2012, and overall higher occupancy in 2013.  Non-Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by

$12.9 million

as a result of a Non-Same Properties rental operating expense increase of

$9.9 million

and higher occupancy for the development and redevelopment properties delivered since the beginning of 2012.  As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

94%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.

Other income

Other income for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


, of

$13.3 million

and

$18.4 million

, respectively, consisted of the following (in thousands):

Total other income for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, decreased by

$5.1 million

, or 27.9%, to

$13.3 million

, compared to

$18.4 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

, primarily due to lower investment income in 2013.  Investment income decreased largely due to a $5.8 million gain from an equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity during 2012.  The decrease in investment income was partially offset by an increase in interest income.

Rental operating expenses

Total rental operating expenses for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, increased by

$16.3 million

, or

9.4%

, to

$189.0 million

, compared to

$172.8 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  Approximately

$9.9 million

of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to


development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2012, and

five

operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2012.


General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent at

$48.5 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, compared to

$47.7 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  Property acquisition-related expenses of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, were offset by lower consulting fees in 2013.  In 2012, we implemented new enterprise-wide software, which required temporary consulting services.  The acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2013 were related to the acquisition of  properties with in-place leases.  The temporary consulting services were primarily related to data conversion costs and internal and external enterprise-software training costs.  As a percentage of total assets, our general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at 0.64% for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, and 0.67% for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.

Interest expense

Interest expense for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, decreased by

$1.2 million

, or

1.8%

, to

$68.0 million

, compared to

$69.2 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

, detailed as follows (in thousands):

The total interest incurred decreased by

$3.4 million

during the

year ended December 31, 2013

, compared to the

year ended December 31, 2012

, primarily as a result of a $612.0 million reduction in our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans in 2013 and the decrease in expense related to the expiration, at various dates from September 2012 through September 2013, of certain interest rate swap agreements aggregating

$250 million

with rates ranging from 4.546% to 5.015%.  As these interest rate swaps ended, we opted to leave a portion of the underlying debt unhedged in anticipation of a reduction of outstanding variable-rate debt that occurred during May 2013, when we issued

$500.0 million

of unsecured notes payable at a fixed rate of 3.90%.  In addition, we reduced the outstanding principal balance outstanding on our unsecured senior bank term loans by

$500 million

in 2012 and 2013 and we amended our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans in 2013 to reduce our interest rate on outstanding borrowings.  These decreases in interest costs have been partially offset by the increase in interest expense from the issuances of unsecured senior notes payable.  Since the beginning of 2012, we have issued

$1.05 billion

of unsecured senior notes payable.  The amended terms and corresponding interest rates of our senior bank term loans and our senior line of credit are as follows:


Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, increased by

$3.4 million

, or

1.9%

, to

$189.1 million

, compared to

$185.7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

.  Depreciation increased due to building improvements, including


development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1,


, and

five

operating properties that were acquired in North America after January 1,


.  The increase in depreciation expense from 2012 to 2013 was partially offset by adjustments recognized in 2012 which were necessary to reduce the carrying amount of buildings and improvements in connection with planned redevelopments.

Impairment of land parcel

During the three months ended

December 31, 2012

, we committed to sell a land parcel with 50,000 developable square feet rather than hold it on a long-term basis for future development.  Upon our decision to sell, we reduced the costs of the land parcel to the anticipated sales price, less cost to sell.  As a result, in the three months ended

December 31, 2012

, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $2.1 million.  We completed the sale of this land parcel in May 2013 at an aggregate sales price of $2.7 million, and a gain upon sale of $391 thousand.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt

During the

year ended December 31, 2013

, in conjunction with the refinancing of our unsecured senior bank term loans and the partial repayment of $250.0 million of our unsecured senior bank term loan due in 2016 (“2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan”), we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating

$2.0 million

, related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees.  During the

year ended December 31, 2012

, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately

$2.2 million

, including $1.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees upon modification of our unsecured senior line of credit and $0.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees resulting from the early repayment of our $250.0 million unsecured senior bank term loan due in 2012 (“2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan”).

Income from discontinued operations

Income from discontinued operations, of

$900 thousand

and

$8.8 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and 2012, respectively, includes the results of operations of

four

operating properties that were classified as “held for sale” as of

December 31, 2013

, as well as the results of operations (prior to disposition) and gain/loss on sale of real estate attributable to 13 properties sold subsequent to January 1, 2012, as well as any related impairment losses.  During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized an impairment loss aggregating $11.4 million related to our decision to sell rather than hold our investment in 1124 Columbia Street in the Seattle market and One Innovation Drive, 377 Plantation Street, and 381 Plantation Street in the Greater Boston market.  We completed the sale of these assets in 2013 along with our sale of 25/35/45 West Watkins Mill Road and 1201 Clopper Road in the Maryland market and 702 Electronic Drive in Pennsylvania, for an aggregate sales price of

$128.6 million

and a net loss on sale of

$121 thousand

.

Gain on sale of land parcel

During the

year ended December 31, 2013

, we sold

four

parcels of land for aggregate consideration of

$73.3 million

and recognized an aggregate gain of

$4.8 million

, which included a gain of $4.1 million on the sale of our final land parcel in the Mission Bay submarket of the San Francisco Bay Area at 1600 Owens Street for

$55.2 million

.

In March 2012, we completed an in-substance partial sale of our interest in a joint venture that owned a land parcel, resulting in a $1.9 million gain on sale of land parcel.  See the “Comparison of the year ended

December 31, 2012

, to the year ended

December 31, 2011

” for further information.

The land parcels sold did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition.  Pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains/losses on sales or disposals by REITs required by the SEC, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a REIT that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the income statement.  Accordingly, we classified the gain on sale of land parcel below income from discontinued operations, in the consolidated statements of income, and included the gain in income from continuing operations attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders in the “control number,” or numerator for the computation of earnings per share.


Comparison of the year ended

December 31, 2012

, to the year ended

December 31, 2011

The following table presents a comparison of the components of NOI for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, compared to the year ended

December 31, 2011

, and a reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure (dollars in thousands):


Rental revenues

Total rental revenues for the

year ended December 31, 2012

, increased by

$18.0 million

, or

4.4%

, to

$422.8 million

, compared to

$404.8 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2011

.  The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including 21 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2011, and six operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2011.

Tenant recoveries

Tenant recoveries for the

year ended December 31, 2012

, increased by

$7.1 million

, or

5.6%

, to

$133.3 million

, compared to

$126.2 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2011

, due to an increase of

$15.1 million

, or

9.6%

, of rental operating expenses.  Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by

$1.2 million

, while Same Properties rental operating expenses increased by

$4.9 million

, primarily due to normal temporary vacancies throughout our Same Properties portfolio.  Our Same Properties rental operating expenses increased primarily due to year-over-year increases in property taxes, property insurance rates, and the timing of repairs and maintenance expenses.  Occupancy of Same Properties was 93.9% and 93.7% as of December 31,


and


, respectively.  Non-Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by

$5.9 million

, while Non-Same Properties rental operating expenses increased by

$10.3 million

, primarily due to some vacancies related to development and redevelopment properties delivered since January 1, 2011, and an increase in certain non-recoverable expenses.  As of

December 31, 2012

, approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.

Other income

Other income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, of

$18.4 million

and

$5.8 million

, respectively, was as follows (in thousands):

Total other income for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, increased by

$12.7 million

, or 219.9%, to

$18.4 million

, compared to

$5.8 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2011

.  Investment income increased primarily due to a $5.8 million gain from an equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity and an overall increase in the investment income earned.  Interest income also increased primarily as a result of the increase in interest earned from higher bank account balances.

Rental operating expenses

Total rental operating expenses for the

year ended December 31, 2012

, increased by

$15.1 million

, or

9.6%

, to

$172.8 million

, compared to

$157.6 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2011

.  Approximately

$10.3 million

of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to 21 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2011, and six operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2011.  Rental operating expenses at our Same Properties increased

$4.9 million

primarily due to increases in property taxes, property insurance, and repairs and maintenance expenses, as discussed in Tenant Recoveries above.  In October 2012, our property at 450 East 29th Street, the East Tower of the Alexandria Center™ for Life Science – New York City, a multi-tenant building with 309,141 RSF, experienced water damage, along with many other properties owned by other landlords in New York City.  Our assessment identified water damage in the underground parking area at our property, with no structural damage.  The total estimated water damage and cleanup costs were approximately $800 thousand.


General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses for the

year ended December 31, 2012

, increased by

$6.6 million

, or

16.1%

, to

$47.7 million

, compared to $41.1 million for the

year ended December 31, 2011

.  The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with our Chief Executive Officer to provide a performance-based compensation program.  Additionally, the increase in general and administrative expenses was related to an increase in the number of employees due to the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets.  During the

year ended December 31, 2012

, our average number of employees increased by 25 employees, or 13%, to 221, compared to an average of 196 for the

year ended December 31, 2011

.  As a percentage of total assets, general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at 0.67% for the

year ended December 31, 2012

, compared to 0.63% for the

year ended December 31, 2011

.

Interest expense

Interest expense for the

year ended December 31, 2012

, increased by

$5.8 million

, or

9.2%

, to

$69.2 million

, compared to

$63.4 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2011

, detailed as follows (in thousands):

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of our unsecured senior notes payable since January 1, 2011, and an increase in the balance outstanding on our unsecured senior bank term loans from a weighted average outstanding balance of $1.0 billion for the

year ended December 31, 2011

, to a weighted average outstanding balance of $1.4 billion for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  This increase was partially offset by repayments of nine secured notes payable approximating $71.2 million and repurchases of our 3.70% unsecured senior convertible notes (“3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes”) aggregating $84.7 million since January 1, 2011.  Interest expense related to our unsecured senior line of credit also decreased, primarily due to a lower average outstanding balance of

$414.8 million

during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to

$746.8 million

during the

year ended December 31, 2011

, and a decrease in the effective interest rate of our unsecured senior line of credit from 2.6% as of

December 31, 2011

, to 1.4% as of

December 31, 2012

.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization for the

year ended December 31, 2012

, increased by

$34.8 million

, or

23.0%

, to

$185.7 million

, compared to

$150.9 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2011

.  The increase resulted primarily from increased depreciation related to building improvements, including 21 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2011, and six operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2011.  Depreciation also increased as a result of depreciation adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying amount of buildings and improvements in connection with planned redevelopments.

Impairment of land parcel

During the three months ended

December 31, 2012

, we committed to sell a land parcel with 50,000 developable square feet rather than hold it on a long-term basis for future development.  Upon our decision to sell, we reduced the costs of the land parcel to our estimate of fair value, based on the anticipated sales price, less cost to sell.  As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $2.1 million.  We completed the sale of this land parcel in May 2013 at an aggregate sales price of $2.7 million and a gain upon sale of approximately $391 thousand.


Loss on early extinguishment of debt

During the

year ended December 31, 2012

, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately

$2.2 million

, including $1.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees upon modification of our unsecured senior line of credit and $0.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees resulting from the early repayment of $250.0 million of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan.  During the

year ended December 31, 2011

, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately

$6.5 million

related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $217.1 million principal amount of our 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes and the partial and early repayment of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan.

Income from discontinued operations

Income from discontinued operations of

$8.8 million

and

$18.1 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and 2011, respectively, includes the results of operations of

four

operating properties that were classified as “held for sale” as of

December 31, 2013

, as well as the results of operations (prior to disposition) and gain/loss on sale of real estate attributable to


properties sold subsequent to January 1, 2011, as well as any related impairment losses.  During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we committed to sell four operating properties: 1124 Columbia Street in the Seattle market and One Innovation Drive, 377 Plantation Street, and 381 Plantation Street in the suburban Greater Boston market, aggregating 504,130 RSF, rather than to hold them on a long-term basis.  At the time of our commitment to dispose of these assets, these four properties were on average 94% occupied and generated approximately $12.8 million in annual operating income.  Upon our commitment to sell, we reduced the net book value of these assets to the anticipated sales price, less cost to sell.  As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $9.8 million.  In December 2012, we entered into an agreement with a third party for the sale of 1124 Columbia Street at a price of $42.6 million, which was below our reduced carrying costs as of September 30, 2012.  As a result, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $1.6 million in order to reduce the carrying costs to our revised estimated fair value less cost to sell.  We completed the sale of these assets in 2013 along with our sale of 25/35/45 West Watkins Mill Road and 1201 Clopper Road in the Maryland market and 702 Electronic Drive in Pennsylvania, for an aggregate sales price of

$128.6 million

and a net loss upon sale of

$121 thousand

.

Gain on sale of land parcel

In March 2012, we completed an in-substance partial sale on a portion of our interest in a joint venture, and admitted as a 50% member Clarion Partners, LLC, resulting in a reduction of our ownership interest from 55% to 27.5%.  The transfer of one-half of our 55% ownership interest in this real estate venture to Clarion Partners, LLC, was accounted for as an in-substance partial sale of an interest in the underlying real estate.  In connection with the sale of one-half of our 55% ownership interest in the land parcel, we received a special distribution of approximately $22.3 million, which included the recognition of a $1.9 million gain on sale of land and approximately $5.4 million from our share of loan refinancing proceeds.

In August 2011, we completed the sale of a land parcel in our San Diego market for an aggregate sales price of approximately $17.3 million, at a gain on sale of approximately $46,000.

The land parcels sold did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition.  Pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains/losses on sales or disposals by REITs required by the SEC, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a REIT that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the income statement.  Accordingly, in the consolidated statements of income, we classified the gain on sale of land parcel below income from discontinued operations and included the gain in income from continuing operations attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders in the “control number,” or numerator, for the computation of earnings per share.


Projected results

Based on our current view of existing market conditions and certain current assumptions, we have updated guidance for earnings per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted and reaffirmed guidance for FFO per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, each for the year ended December 31, 2014, as set forth in the table below.  The table below provides a reconciliation of FFO per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, a non-GAAP measure, to earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and other key assumptions included in our guidance for the year ended December 31, 2014.

As of

December 31, 2013

, we had construction in progress related to our

five

North American development projects and

one

North American redevelopment project, respectively.  The completion of these projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contributions from Same Properties, is expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, NOI, and cash flows.  Operating performance assumptions related to the completion of our development and redevelopment projects in North America, including the timing of initial occupancy, stabilization dates, and Initial Stabilized Yield, are included in “Item 2. Properties – Investments in Real Estate.”  Certain key assumptions regarding our projections, including the impact of various development and redevelopment projects, are included in the tables above and in the “Development and Redevelopment Projects in North America” table in “Item 2. Properties – Investments in Real Estate” and in “Sources and Uses of Capital,” including the “Projected Construction Spending ” table.

The completion of our development and redevelopment projects will result in the increase of interest expense and other project costs, because these project costs will no longer qualify for capitalization and these costs will be expensed as incurred.  Our projection assumptions for straight-line rents, general and administrative expenses, capitalization of interest, interest expense, and Same Property NOI growth are included in the tables on this page and are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under the “Forward-looking Statements” section of Part I, the “Risk Factors” section of Item 1A, and the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section under Item 7, of this annual report on Form 10-K for the

year ended December 31, 2013

.  To the extent our full-year earnings guidance is updated during the year, we will provide additional disclosure supporting reasons for any significant changes to such guidance.


Liquidity and capital resources

Overview

We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for property acquisitions, development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing costs, non-revenue-generating expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic joint venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.

We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities.  We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT.

Over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:

•

Reduce our amount of unsecured bank debt;

•

Maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective asset sales, joint ventures, preferred stock, and common stock;

•

Manage the amount of debt maturing in a single year;

•

Mitigate unhedged variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate bank debt;

•

Maintain adequate liquidity from net cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit and available commitments under secured construction loans;

•

Maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;

•

Fund preferred stock and common stock dividends from net cash provided by operating activities;

•

Retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends for reinvestment in acquisitions and/or development and redevelopment projects;

•

Continue to reduce our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of our gross investment in real estate through our continued delivery of development and redevelopment projects, and selective land sales; and

•

Maintain solid key credit metrics, including net debt to adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratio, with some variation from quarter to quarter and year to year.


Unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans

On July 26, 2013, we amended our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan to reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings.  We expect to repay this loan over the next three years.  In addition, on August 30, 2013, we amended our $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit and our 2019 unsecured senior bank term loan (“2019 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan”) to reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings, extend the maturity dates, and amend certain financial covenants.  Also on August 30, 2013, we amended our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan to conform certain financial covenants to those contained in the amended credit agreement related to the unsecured senior line of credit and the 2019 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan.  The maturity dates below reflect available extension options that we control.

During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, in conjunction with aggregate paydown of $250.0 million of our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan and the refinancing of our unsecured senior bank term loans, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating

$2.0 million

, related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees.

The maturity date of the unsecured senior line of credit is January 2019, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the stated maturity date, twice, by an additional six months after each exercise.  Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at LIBOR or the base rate specified in the amended unsecured senior line of credit agreement, plus in either case a specified margin (“Applicable Margin”).  The Applicable Margin for LIBOR borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit is based on our existing credit rating as set by certain rating agencies.  As of

December 31, 2013

, we had

$204.0 million

of borrowings outstanding.  See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report for the Applicable Margin in effect at

December 31, 2013

.  In addition to the Applicable Margin, our unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20%.

The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans as of

December 31, 2013

, were as follows:

(1)

For a definition of the ratios, refer to the amended unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan agreements, each dated as of August 30, 2013, which was filed as exhibits to the Quarterly Report for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, on Form 10-Q.

(2)

Actual covenants are calculated pursuant to the specific terms to our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan agreements.


Unsecured senior notes payable

The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our 3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes and 4.60% Unsecured Senior Notes as of

December 31, 2013

, were as follows:

(1)

For a definition of the ratios, refer to the most current indenture and related supplements, which are filed with the SEC as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K on February 29, 2012, and June 7, 2013.

In addition, the terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P., and the Company’s subsidiaries to (i) consummate a merger, or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, and (ii) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness.

Sources and uses of capital

We expect that our principal liquidity needs for the year ended December 31, 2014, will be satisfied by the following multiple sources of capital as shown in the table below.  There can be no assurance that our sources and uses of capital will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations.

(1)

Includes the assumption of a non-recourse secured note payable of $40.7 million in connection with the acquisition of a property in January 2014.

(2)

Represents the principal amortization payments on all of our secured notes payable, including one secured note payable related to Alexandria Technology Square

®

that was repaid on

January 31, 2014

.  This amount excludes $20.9 million that was funded by our 10% joint venture partner.

(3)

Projected joint venture of non-income-producing assets.

The key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above are a favorable capital market environment and performance of our core operations in areas such as delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, leasing activity, and renewals.  Our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under the “Forward-Looking Statements” section of Part I, the “Risk Factors” section of Item 1A, and the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section under Item 7, of our annual report on Form 10-K for the

year ended December 31, 2013

.  We expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.


Sources of capital

Real estate sales / strategic joint venture capital

We continue the disciplined execution of our asset recycling program to monetize non-strategic non-income-producing assets as a source of capital through asset sales or from joint venture proceeds.  During 2013 we sold

four

land parcels for aggregate consideration of

$73.3 million

.  For 2014, we expect to monetize $145 million to $245 million through the sale of land or from joint venture proceeds related to non-income-producing assets.

We completed substantially all significant sales of non-strategic income-producing assets targeted for 2013 aggregating

$128.6 million

.  As of December 31, 2013, we had

four

properties classified as “held for sale” with an aggregate book value of $7.6 million.

Secured construction loans

In May 2013, we closed a secured construction loan with aggregate commitments of $36.0 million for our 100% pre-leased development project at 269 East Grand Avenue in the San Francisco Bay Area market.  The construction loan matures in June 2016, and we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of June 1, 2016, by one year, twice, to June 1, 2018, subject to certain conditions.  The construction loan bears interest at LIBOR or the base rate specified in the construction loan agreement, defined as the higher of either the prime rate being offered by our lender or the federal funds rate in effect on the day of borrowing (“Base Rate”), plus in either case a specified margin of 1.40% for LIBOR borrowings or 0.25% for Base Rate borrowings.  As of December 31, 2013, commitments of $36.0 million were available under this loan.

In August 2013, we closed a secured construction loan for our development project at 75/125 Binney Street in the Greater Boston market.  The construction loan matures in August 2017, and we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of August 23, 2017, by

one year

, to August 23, 2018, subject to certain conditions.  The construction loan bears interest at the LIBOR or the Base Rate specified in the construction loan agreement, plus in either case a specified margin of 1.35% for LIBOR borrowings or 0.35% for Base Rate borrowings.  As of December 31, 2013,

100%

of commitments aggregating

$250.4 million

were available under this loan.

In June 2012, we closed a secured construction loan with aggregate commitments of

$55.0 million

.  The construction loan matures in July 2015, and we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of July 1, 2015, by

one year

, twice, to July 1, 2017, subject to certain conditions.  The construction loan bears interest at the LIBOR or the base rate specified in the construction loan agreement, defined as the higher of either the prime rate being offered by our lender or the Base Rate, plus in either case a specified margin of 1.50% for LIBOR borrowings or 0.25% for Base Rate borrowings.  As of December 31, 2013, the outstanding loan balance was

$46.0 million

and commitments of

$9.0 million

were available under this loan.

Unsecured senior line of credit

We use our unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties.  As of

December 31, 2013

, we had

$1.3 billion

available for borrowing under our $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit.

Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a “Eurocurrency Rate” or a “Base Rate” specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement, plus, in either case, the Applicable Margin.  The “Eurocurrency Rate” specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to (i) the LIBOR or a successor rate thereto as approved by the administrative agent for loans denominated in a LIBOR quoted currency (i.e., U.S. Dollars, Euro, Sterling, or Yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to Canadian dollar banker's acceptances for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, (iii) the Bank Bill Swap Reference Bid rate for loans denominated in Australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-LIBOR quoted currency (other than Canadian or Australian dollars). The “Base Rate” specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement means for any day a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the

federal funds rate

plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its “prime rate,” and (c) the

Eurocurrency Rate

plus

1.00%

.  The Applicable Margin for LIBOR borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit as of

December 31, 2013

, was

1.10%

, which is based on our existing credit rating as set by certain rating agencies.  As of

December 31, 2013

, we had

$204 million

in borrowings outstanding on our

$1.5 billion

unsecured senior line of credit.  Our unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of

0.20%

based on the aggregate commitments outstanding.


Liquidity

The following table presents the remaining availability under our unsecured senior line of credit, secured construction loans, and cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands):

Cash and cash equivalents

As of

December 31, 2013

, we had approximately

$57.7 million

of cash and cash equivalents.  We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, secured construction loan borrowings, issuances of unsecured notes payable, and issuances of common stock to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, scheduled debt repayments, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Restricted cash

Restricted cash consisted of the following as of

December 31, 2013

, and

December 31, 2012

(in thousands):

The funds held in escrow related to construction projects will be used to pay for certain construction costs.

Secured notes payable

In December 2013, we extended the maturity date of a $76.0 million secured note payable from April 20, 2014, to January 20, 2017.

3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes payable offering

In June 2013, we completed the issuance of our 3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes due in June 2023.  Net proceeds of approximately $498.6 million were initially used to prepay a portion of the outstanding principal balance of $750.0 million on our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan and to reduce the outstanding borrowings on our unsecured senior line of credit to zero.  As a result of the partial prepayment of our term loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees.  See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Report.


Other sources

Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities.  These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital.

We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements.  These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction-related and financing-related activities.  In January 2014, our joint venture partner funded approximately $20.9 million related to the repayment of our $208.7 million secured note payable collateralized by Alexandria Technology Square

Uses of capital

Summary of capital expenditures

The primary use of capital has historically been related to the development, redevelopment, and construction of properties.  In North America, we currently have development projects under way for

947,927

RSF of laboratory space.  In addition, we have a 27.5% interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that is currently developing a building aggregating

413,536

RSF in the Longwood Medical Area of the Greater Boston market.  We incur construction costs related to development, redevelopment, and other construction activities and additional project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development or construction of a project during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress.


The following tables summarize the total projected capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the components of our total actual capital expenditures for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, which include interest, property taxes, insurance, payroll, and other indirect project costs (in thousands):

(1)

Developments/redevelopments recently transferred to rental properties include certain vacancies, generally less than 10% of the project, that may require additional construction prior to occupancy.  For example, our recently delivered redevelopment projects at 4757 Nexus Center Drive, 400 Technology Square, 343 Oyster Point Boulevard, 1616 Eastlake Avenue, 1551 Eastlake Avenue, and 10300 Campus Point Drive generally have 15,000 to 30,000 RSF of value-creation activities to complete in connection with the lease-up and delivery of the space.

(2)

Includes, among others, generic infrastructure building improvement projects in North America, including 300 Technology Square, 5810/5820 Nancy Ridge Drive, 8000 Virginia Manor Road, and 44 Hartwell Avenue.

(3)

Near-term value-creation development projects include, among others, 5200 Illumina Way.

(4)

Near-term value-creation redevelopment projects include, among others, 3033 Science Park Road and 10121 Barnes Canyon Road. These projects were acquired in the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2013, respectively.

(5)

Includes traditional preconstruction costs plus predevelopment costs related to: (i) approximately $17 million of site and infrastructure costs for the 1.2 million RSF related to 50 Binney Street, 60 Binney Street, and 100 Binney Street at the Alexandria Center™ at Kendall Square, including utility access and roads, installation of storm drain systems, infiltration systems, traffic lighting/signals, streets, and sidewalks, and (ii) approximately $4 million related to the design, permitting, and construction drawings related to 50 Binney Street and 60 Binney Street. Site and infrastructure costs related to 75/125 Binney Street are included in our estimate of cost at completion and initial stabilized yields.

There can be no assurance that our projected capital expenditures will not be materially lower or higher than these expectations.

(1)

Includes revenue-enhancing projects and amounts shown in the table below related to non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures.


The tables below show the average per square foot property-related non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from client tenants, revenue-enhancing, or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) during the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


(dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts):

We expect our capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from client tenants, revenue-enhancing, or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) on a per square foot basis in 2014 to be approximately similar to the amounts shown in the preceding table.

We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred.  Capitalized interest for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


, of approximately

$60.6 million

and

$62.8 million

, respectively, is classified in investments in real estate, net.  Indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use.  We capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, and construction projects, aggregating approximately

$17.5 million

and

$13.4 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.  Additionally, should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred.  When construction activities cease, the asset is transferred out of construction in progress and classified as rental properties, net.  Also, if vertical aboveground construction is not initiated at completion of predevelopment activities, the land parcel will be classified as land held for future development.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income.  For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately

$7.7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

We also capitalize and defer initial direct costs to originate leases with independent third parties related to evaluating a prospective lessee’s financial condition, negotiating lease terms, preparing the lease agreement, and closing the lease transaction.  Costs that we have capitalized and deferred relate to successful leasing transactions, result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction, and would not have been incurred had that leasing transaction not occurred.  The initial direct costs capitalized and deferred also include the portion of our employees’ total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing activities previously described and related to the respective lease that would not have been performed but for that lease. Total initial direct leasing costs capitalized during the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


, were approximately

$43.8 million

and

$45.9 million

, respectively, of which approximately

$11.0 million

and

$10.6 million

, respectively, represented capitalized and deferred payroll costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities during such periods.

Acquisitions

On July 5, 2013, we agreed to invest $13.1 million at 10121/10151 Barnes Canyon Road, a 115,895 RSF office property located in the Sorrento Mesa submarket of San Diego.  Our investment of $5.4 million was funded in August 2013 and an additional $7.7 million will be funded no later than October 2014.  The property is currently 100% occupied with leases that expire in 2014 and 2015.  We intend to convert the existing office space into laboratory space through redevelopment when the spaces become available.  Initial stabilized yields and average cash yield will be provided in the future upon commencement of the redevelopment.


On September 16, 2013, we acquired 407 Davis Drive, a Class A laboratory/office property in our Research Triangle Park market for a total purchase price of $19.4 million.  The building consists of 81,956 RSF and is 100% leased to Bayer AG.  The initial stabilized cash and GAAP yields are 7.8% and 8.7%, respectively.  The estimated average cash yield for the project is 8.7%.

On

November 12, 2013

, we acquired three adjacent buildings aggregating

55,213

RSF at

11055, 11065, and 11075 Roselle Street

in the Sorrento Valley submarket of

San Diego

for a total purchase price of

$8.3 million

.  The buildings are currently undergoing redevelopment and we pre-leased

75%

of the space to

Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc.

The estimated initial stabilized yields for this project are

7.8%

and

7.9%

, on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively.  The estimated average cash yield for the project is

8.0%

.

On

November 27, 2013

, we acquired

150 Second Street

, a

123,210

RSF, newly developed Class A property in the Cambridge submarket of

Greater Boston

, for a total purchase price of

$94.5 million

.  The building is

85%

leased to two publicly traded life science companies.  The estimated initial stabilized yields for this property are

7.3%

and

7.5%

, on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively.  The estimated average cash yield for the project is 8.2%.

2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan repayment

As part of our continuing transition from bank debt financing to unsecured senior notes payable, and from variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt, and from short-term debt to long-term debt, we repaid $250.0 million of our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan during the

year ended December 31, 2013

.  As a result of this early prepayment, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees during the

year ended December 31, 2013

, aggregating

$2.0 million

.

Contractual obligations and commitments

Contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2013

, consisted of the following (in thousands):

(1)

Amounts represent principal amounts due and exclude unamortized premiums/discounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets.

(2)

Amounts include noncontrolling interests’ share of scheduled principal maturities of approximately $20.9 million, all of which matures in 2014. See discussion under Note 6, Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt, for additional information.

(3)

Payment dates include any extension options that we control.

(4)

Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt and hedged variable-rate debt were based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates.

(5)

The interest payments on variable-rate debt were based on the interest rates in effect as of

December 31, 2013

.

Secured notes payable

Secured notes payable as of

December 31, 2013

, consisted of 15 notes secured by 38 properties.  Our secured notes payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.45% as of

December 31, 2013

.  Noncontrolling interests’ share of consolidated secured notes payable aggregated approximately $20.9 million as of

December 31, 2013

.  The total book values of rental properties, net, land held for future development, and construction in progress securing debt were approximately $1.6 billion as of

December 31, 2013

.  As of

December 31, 2013

, our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts, were composed of approximately $586.6 million and $122.2 million of fixed and variable-rate debt, respectively.

On

January 31, 2014

, we repaid our

$208.7 million

secured note payable related to Alexandria Technology Square

®

.  Our joint venture partner funded $20.9 million of the proceeds required to repay the secured note payable.


Estimated interest payments

Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt and hedged variable-rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates.  As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

84%

of our debt was fixed-rate debt or variable-rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements.  See additional information regarding our interest rate swap agreements under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Contractual Obligations and Commitments – Interest Rate Swap Agreements.”  The remaining

16%

of our debt as of

December 31, 2013

, was unhedged variable-rate debt based primarily on LIBOR.  Interest payments on our unhedged variable-rate debt have been calculated based on interest rates in effect as of

December 31, 2013

.  See additional information regarding our debt under Note 6, Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt, to our consolidated financial statements appearing in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

Interest rate swap agreements

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans.  These agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our payment of fixed-rate amounts to the counterparty over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.  Interest received under all of our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR.  The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.

We have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty.  These master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between the Company and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate swap agreements.  In order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate swap agreements, our interest rate swap agreements are spread among various counterparties.  As of

December 31, 2013

, the largest aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty was $250.0 million.  If one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate swap agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable-rate LIBOR-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated.  We have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate swap agreements.

Other resources and liquidity requirements

Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital.  We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities.

Ground lease obligations

Ground lease obligations as of

December 31, 2013

, included leases for


of our properties, which accounted for approximately

16%

of our total number of properties, and

two

land development parcels.  Excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in


with a net book value of approximately

$8.9 million

at

December 31, 2013

, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms generally ranging from


to


years, including extension options.

A 100% owned subsidiary of the Company previously executed a ground lease, as ground lessee, for certain property in New York City.  The West Tower of the Alexandria Center™ for Life Science – New York City is being constructed on such ground-leased property.  In November 2012, we commenced vertical construction of the West Tower.  The ground lease provides that substantial completion of the West Tower occur by October 31, 2015, and requires satisfying conditions that include substantially completed construction in accordance with the plans.  The ground lease also provides that by October 31, 2016, the ground lessee shall obtain a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy for the core and shell of both the East Tower of the Alexandria Center™ for Life Science – New York City and the West Tower.  In each case, the target dates above are subject to force majeure, to contractual cure rights, to other legal remedies available to ground lessees generally, and to change for any reason by agreement between the two parties under the ground lease.  All of the required milestones have been met.


Commitments

As of

December 31, 2013

, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and generic life science infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases approximated

$272.0 million

.  We expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time.  We are also committed to funding approximately

$46.7 million

for certain investments over the next several years.  In addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations of

$13.9 million

primarily related to our construction management requirements.

We have minimum development requirements under project development agreements with government entities in some of our future value-creation projects.  At

December 31, 2013

, we have land and land improvements with an aggregate book value of approximately

$18.8 million

where we have construction commitment obligations aggregating approximately

300,000

RSF that need to be fulfilled by 2016.  The estimated cost to develop these projects will be approximately $115 to $145 per square foot.  If we do not meet, extend, or eliminate these commitments, we may default under our existing agreements.  The government entities in turn also have certain obligations to us under those project development agreements.  We are working with these entities to fulfill or amend certain existing obligations in a mutually beneficial manner.

Exposure to environmental liabilities

In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues.  The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed.  In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

Cash flows

We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.  The following table summarizes changes in the Company’s cash flows for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


(in thousands):

Operating activities

Cash flows provided by operating activities consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):


Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent on the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the delivery of development projects, and the timing and delivery of redevelopment projects.  Net cash provided by operating activities for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, increased to

$312.7 million

, compared to

$305.5 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities, for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, increased by approximately

$27.3 million

million, or

9.4%

, to

$317.5 million

, compared to

$290.2 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our Same Properties cash NOI of approximately

$17.3 million

, or

5.4%

, to

$340.8 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, compared to

$323.5 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  The remainder of our increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the delivery of significant development and redevelopment projects in 2013.  See the “Value-Creation Opportunities and External Growth” for a summary of key deliveries.

Investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, was

$591.4 million

, compared to

$558.1 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  This change consisted of the following (in thousands):

The change in net cash used in investing activities for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, is primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures for construction, including capital expenditures related to our development and redevelopment projects, and a higher investment in property acquisitions during the

year ended December 31, 2013

, as compared to the

year ended December 31, 2012

, offset by higher proceeds from sales of properties during the

year ended December 31, 2013

.  For additional information on the acquisition and disposition of real estate assets, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report.

Value-creation opportunities and external growth

As of

December 31, 2013

, we had

five

ground-up development projects in process in North America, including an unconsolidated joint venture development project, aggregating

1,361,463

RSF.  We also had

one

project in North America with

55,213

RSF undergoing conversion into laboratory space through redevelopment.  These projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contributions from Same Properties, are expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, NOI, and cash flows.  For further discussion, see “Sources and Uses of Capital – Uses of Capital – Summary of Capital Expenditures” above.

Our initial stabilized yield on a cash basis reflects cash rents at date of stabilization after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed.  We expect, on average, our cash rents related to our value-creation projects to increase over time pursuant to contractual rent escalations.  As of

December 31, 2013

,

95%

of our leases contained annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index.

During the

year ended December 31, 2013

, we executed leases aggregating

896,511

RSF and

277,795

RSF, respectively, related to our development and redevelopment projects.

For information on our key deliveries of development and redevelopment projects for the year ended December 31,

2013, see “Value-Creation Projects and External Growth” located earlier within Item 7 of this report.


Financing activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, decreased by

$117.3 million

, to

$197.6 million

, compared to

$314.9 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  This decrease consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):

Secured construction loans

See the “Secured construction loans” section in Sources and Uses of Capital in Item 7 of this report for details.

Debt repayments, refinancing, and losses on early extinguishment of debt

During the

year ended December 31, 2013

, in conjunction with the refinancing of our unsecured senior bank term loans and the partial repayment of $250.0 million of our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating

$2.0 million

, related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees.

Dividends

We are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred and common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities.  All such distributions are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.  We may be required to use borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status.  We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels.


During the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


, we paid the following dividends (in thousands):

The increase in dividends paid on our common stock was primarily due to an increase in the related dividends to

$2.49

per common share for the

year ended December 31, 2013

, from

$2.02

per common share for the

year ended December 31, 2012

.  The increase was also due to an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding to

71.2 million

shares as of

December 31, 2013

, compared to

63.2 million

shares as of

December 31, 2012

.

Inflation

As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

94%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.  Approximately

95%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from

3%

to

3.5%

) or indexed based on a consumer price index or another index.  Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flow or earnings from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation.  An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans.

Critical accounting policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.  The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses.  We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

REIT compliance

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.  Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.  We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT.  However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.  If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.


Investments in real estate, net, and discontinued operations

We recognize real estate acquired (including the intangible value of above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date.  If there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term, we evaluate factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew.  When we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider its impact in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period.  The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an “as if vacant” basis.  The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases, considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease.

We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  We also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.  Acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of businesses, including real estate acquired with in-place leases, are expensed as incurred.

The values allocated to land improvements, tenant improvements, equipment, buildings, and building improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of

20 years

for land improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, the estimated useful life for equipment, and the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease and up to

40 years

for buildings and building improvements.  The values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and recognized as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income.  The values of acquired in-place leases are classified in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.

A property is classified as “held for sale” when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.  When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as “held for sale”; and if (i) the operations and cash flows of the property have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations, and (ii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property after the sale, then its operations, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income; and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations.  Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as “held for sale.”

Impairment of long-lived assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, construction in progress, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions indicate that the amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.  Impairment indicators or triggering events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, and construction in progress, are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to, significantly adverse changes in NOI, vacancy, operating losses, cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, or previously unknown and materially adverse environmental matters, among other factors.  The amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based on our latest estimates of current and future economic conditions that may affect the property whenever indicators of impairment are present.  Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value.  If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used.  We may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.


We use the “held for sale” impairment model for our properties classified as “held for sale.”  The “held for sale” impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model.  Under the “held for sale” impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the amount of the long-lived asset classified as “held for sale” exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.  Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as “held for sale.”

Capitalization of costs

We are required to capitalize project costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment, or construction of a project.  Capitalization of development, redevelopment, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use.  Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred.  Should development, redevelopment, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance and demolition are expensed as incurred.  Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income.  For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in construction, development, and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately

$7.7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities.  These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases.  Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed as incurred.

Acquisition costs related to business acquisitions, including real estate acquired with in-place leases and abandoned projects, are expensed as incurred.  These costs are classified as general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  During the three months ended

December 31, 2013

, we incurred approximately $1.4 million of acquisition related costs, including abandoned projects.  We completed acquisitions in November 2013 and January 2014 for an aggregate purchase price of $166.8 million.  See “Subsequent Events” in the notes to consolidated financial statements under Item 15 to this report on Form 10-K.  These amounts aggregated approximately $1.1 million, and $1.0 million for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

Investments

We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry.  All of our investments in actively traded public companies are considered “available for sale” and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  Fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of comprehensive income.  The classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date.  The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains or losses classified in other income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies.  Certain investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method when our interest in the entity is not deemed so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies.  Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our investment initially at cost and adjust the amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment.  Additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%.  As of

December 31, 2013

and


, our ownership was in compliance with this limit.

Individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions may indicate an impairment exists.  The factors that we consider in making these assessments include market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements.  If there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate their fair value.  For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings.  We measure and disclose the estimated fair value of individual investments utilizing a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between data obtained from sources independent from us and our own assumptions about individual investments.  For a description of the methodology we use to determine the fair value of privately held entities, refer to Note 9, Fair Value Measurements.


Interest rate swap agreements

We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.  We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities.  We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate swap agreements.  Specifically, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  Our interest rate swap agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on LIBOR.  We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges.  Our objectives in using interest rate swap agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements.

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans.  We recognize our interest rate swap agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value.  The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship.  For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.  Our interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges as they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows.  Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge.  All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly effective” in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates.  We formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy.  We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are “highly effective” in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items.  The ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately recognized in earnings.  While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if swaps did not qualify as “highly effective,” the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.

The fair value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities (also referred to as “significant other observable inputs”).  The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts.  The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.  The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using “significant unobservable inputs” such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.

Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries

Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms.  We classify amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, as an asset in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  We commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the client tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property.

Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred.


Tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments, reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses, property taxes, and other expenses recoverable from client tenants.  Tenant receivables are expected to be collected within

one year

.  We may maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our client tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due.  If a client tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of uncollectible rent and deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent.  As of

December 31, 2013

and


, we had

no

allowance for estimated losses.

As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

94%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.  Approximately

95%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index.  Additionally, approximately

92%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures.

Monitoring client tenant credit quality

During the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality of our client tenants by (i) reviewing the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the client tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments. We have a team of employees who, among them, have graduate and undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, and industrial biotechnology and experience in the life science industry, as well as in finance. This life science research team is responsible for assessing and monitoring the credit quality of our tenants and any material changes in credit quality.

Non-GAAP measures

Funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted

GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time.  In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) established the measurement tool of FFO.  Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs.  We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT.  Moreover, we believe that FFO, as adjusted, is also helpful because it allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies between periods, and on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences caused by investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, terms of securities, capital structures, and capital market transactions.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper and related implementation guidance (“NAREIT White Paper”).  The NAREIT White Paper defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable real estate and land parcels and impairments of depreciable real estate (excluding land parcels), plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Impairments of real estate relate to decreases in the estimated fair value of real estate due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period.  Impairments of real estate represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value.  We compute FFO, as adjusted, as FFO calculated in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper, plus losses on early extinguishment of debt, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments of land parcels, impairments of investments, and deal costs less realized gain on equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards.  Our calculations of both FFO and FFO, as adjusted, may differ from those methodologies utilized by other equity REITs for similar performance measurements, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other equity REITs.  Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including funds available to make distributions.


Adjusted funds from operations

AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance.  We compute AFFO by adding to or deducting from FFO, as adjusted: (i) non-revenue-enhancing building improvements (excluding amounts recoverable from our client tenants), non-revenue-enhancing tenant improvements and leasing commissions (excludes revenue-enhancing and development and redevelopment expenditures); (ii) effects of straight-line rent and straight-line rent on ground leases; (iii) capitalized income from development projects; (iv) amortization of acquired above and below market leases, loan fees, and debt premiums/discounts; (v) stock compensation expense; and (vi) allocation of AFFO attributable to unvested restricted stock awards.

We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental performance measure because it further adjusts to: (i) deduct certain expenditures that, although capitalized and classified in depreciation expense, do not enhance the revenue or cash flows of our properties; (ii) eliminate the effect of straight-lining our rental income and capitalizing income from development projects; and (iii) eliminate the effect of items that are not indicative of our core operations and that do not actually reduce the amount of cash generated by our operations.  We believe that eliminating the effect of charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity REITs without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use.  We believe that AFFO provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results because such items are dependent upon historical costs or subject to judgmental valuation inputs and the timing of our decisions.

AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow for the period, and is intended only to provide an additional measure of performance.  We believe that net income attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO.  We believe that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of equity REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other equity REITs.  However, other equity REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO calculated by other equity REITs.  AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.


The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – basic, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – basic, FFO attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, as adjusted, and AFFO attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, for the periods below (in thousands):


The following table presents a reconciliation of net income per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – basic, to FFO per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, FFO per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, as adjusted, and AFFO per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, for the periods below.


Adjusted EBITDA

EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), a non-GAAP financial measure, and is used by us and others as a supplemental measure of performance.  We use adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to assess the performance of our core operations, for financial and operational decision making, and as a supplemental or additional means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis.  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA, excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate and land parcels, deal costs, and impairments. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate and land parcels, deal costs, and impairments.  By excluding interest expense and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA allow investors to measure our performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allow for a more meaningful comparison of our performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries.  We believe that excluding charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity REITs without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use.  We believe that adjusting for the effects of gains or losses on sales of real estate and land parcels, deal costs, and impairments provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results.  These items are dependent upon historical costs, and are subject to judgmental inputs and the timing of our decisions.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as measures of our performance.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant and widely used measures of performance, they do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and they should not be considered as alternatives to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.  Further, our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):


Adjusted EBITDA margins

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margins by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues. Because our total revenues exclude revenues from discontinued operations, for the purposes of calculating the margin ratio, we exclude the Adjusted EBITDA generated by our discontinued operations for each period presented. We believe excluding Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations improves the consistency and comparability of the Adjusted EBITDA margins from period to period.  The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA – excluding discontinued operations (dollars in thousands):

Fixed charge coverage ratio

The fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges.  This ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy financing obligations and preferred stock dividends.  Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and amortization of debt premiums/discounts.  The fixed charge coverage ratio calculation below is not directly comparable to the computation of “Consolidated Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Consolidated Ratio of Earnings to Combined Fixed Charges and Preferred Stock Dividends” included in Exhibit 12.1 to our annual report on Form 10-K, as of

December 31, 2013

.

The following table presents a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to cash interest and fixed charges (dollars in thousands):


Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating our balance sheet leverage.  Net debt is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.  See “Adjusted EBITDA” for further information on the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

The following table summarizes the calculation of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as of

December 31, 2013

and 2012 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

We believe the Adjusted EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the

three months ended December 31, 2013

and 2012, annualized, reflect the completion of many development and redevelopment projects and are indicative of the Company’s current operating trends.

NOI

NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, excluding loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of land parcel, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and general and administrative expense.  We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level.  Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.  NOI on a cash basis is NOI on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent adjustments required by GAAP.  We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent adjustments to rental revenue.

Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure, because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations.  NOI excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties.  For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level.  In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level.  Real estate impairments have been excluded in deriving NOI because we do not consider impairment losses to be property-level operating expenses.  Real estate impairment losses relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses.  Our real estate impairments represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell.  These impairments result from investing decisions and the deterioration in market conditions that adversely impact underlying real estate values.  Our calculation of NOI also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to the timing of corporate strategy.  Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs and maintenance, rental expense related to ground leases, contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping, property taxes and insurance, and property-level salaries.  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance,


professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management.  NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other equity REITs that define NOI differently.  We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income.  NOI should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions.

Same Property NOI

See discussion of Same Properties and reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations in “Results of Operations.”

Unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI

Unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of our results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets, as it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level.  We use unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI in order to assess our compliance with our financial covenants under our debt obligations because the measure serves as a proxy for a financial measure under such debt obligations.  Unencumbered NOI is derived from assets classified in continuing operations that are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest as of the period for which income is presented.  Unencumbered NOI for periods prior to the

three months ended December 31, 2013

, has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation related to discontinued operations.  See the reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations in “Results of Operations.”

The following table summarizes unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI for the years ended

December 31, 2013

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest rate risk

The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from many factors, including government monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control.

In order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate risks on our operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swap agreements, caps, floors, and other interest rate exchange contracts.  The use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts.

Our future earnings and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, such as LIBOR.  However, our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate changes.  The following table illustrates the effect of a 1% increase/decrease in interest rates, assuming a LIBOR floor of 0%, on our variable-rate debt, including our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans, after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements, secured debt, unsecured senior notes payable, and unsecured senior convertible notes as of

December 31, 2013

(in thousands):

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements in existence on

December 31, 2013

.  These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.  Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change.  However, because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analyses assume no changes in our capital structure.

Equity price risk

We have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities.  We classify investments in publicly traded companies as “available for sale” and, consequently, recognize them in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.  Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any of the operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest.  For all investments, we recognize other-than-temporary declines in value against earnings in the same period during which the decline in value was deemed to have occurred.  There is no assurance that future declines in value will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.  The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% change in the fair value of our equity investments would have on earnings as of

December 31, 2013

(in thousands):


Foreign currency exchange rate risk

We have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our subsidiaries operating in Canada and Asia.  The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the respective local currencies.  Gains or losses resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets and statements of income are classified in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of total equity.  Gains or losses will be reflected in our statements of income when there is a sale or partial sale of our investment in these operations or upon a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment.  The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar would have on our earnings, based on our current operating assets outside the U.S. as of

December 31, 2013

(in thousands):

This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the U.S. dollar; however, foreign currency exchange rates do not typically move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially.

Our exposure to market risk elements for the year ended

December 31, 2012

, was consistent with the risk elements presented above, including the effects of changes in interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

As of

December 31, 2013

, we had performed an evaluation, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  These controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that information required for disclosure is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the requisite time periods.  Based on our evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended

December 31, 2013

, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the CEO and CFO and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.  The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of


assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

We have audited Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

, based on criteria established in Internal Control − Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 framework (the COSO criteria).  Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of

December 31, 2013

, and

December 31, 2012

, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, change in stockholders’ equity and noncontrolling interests, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2013

, and our report dated

February 28, 2014

, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (the “Company”) as of

December 31, 2013

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and noncontrolling interests, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2013

.  Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15.  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. at

December 31, 2013

and


, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

Our asset base contains


properties approximating

17.5 million

RSF, consisting of the following, as of

December 31, 2013

:

As of

December 31, 2013

, we had


leases with a total of


client tenants, and


, or

44%

, of our


properties were single-tenant properties.  Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have terms of

four

to


years, while the single-tenant building leases typically have initial terms of

eight

to


years.  As of

December 31, 2013

:

Ÿ

Investment-grade client tenants represented

51%

of our total ABR;

Ÿ

Approximately

94%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent;

Ÿ

Approximately

95%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from

3%

to

3.5%

) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and

Ÿ

Approximately

92%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.

Any references to the number of buildings, square footage, number of leases, occupancy, and any amounts derived from these values in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are unaudited.

Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements.  We consolidate the companies because we exercise significant control over major decisions by these entities, such as investment activity and changes in financing.

Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Use of estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and equity; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Operating segment

We are engaged in the business of providing laboratory/office space for lease to the life science industry.  Our properties are similar in that they provide space for lease to the life science industry, consist of laboratory/office improvements that are generic and reusable for the life science industry, are located in key life science cluster markets, and have similar economic characteristics.  Our chief operating decision maker reviews financial information for our entire consolidated operations when making decisions on how to allocate resources and in assessing our operating performance or individual properties when determining real estate decisions.  The financial information disclosed herein represents all of the financial information related to our principal operating segment.

International operations

The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the U.S. is the U.S. dollar.  We have

five

operating properties in Canada,

two

operating properties in China,

five

operating properties in India, and various land parcels in India.  The functional currencies for our foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies in each respective country.  The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date.  Income statement accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the average exchange rate for the periods presented.  Gains or losses resulting from the translation are classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of total equity.

The appropriate amounts of foreign exchange rate gains or losses classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reflected in our consolidated statements of income when there is a sale or partial sale of our investment in these operations or upon a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment.

Investments in real estate, net, and discontinued operations

We recognize real estate acquired (including the intangible value of above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, client tenant relationships, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date.  If there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term, we evaluate factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew.  When we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider its impact in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period.  The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an “as if vacant” basis.  The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred in the execution of similar leases, considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease.  We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  We also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a

100%

interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.  Acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of businesses, including real estate acquired with in-place leases, are expensed as incurred.

F-10

2.

Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

The values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease and up to

40 years

for buildings and building improvements, an estimated life of

20 years

for land improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and recognized as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of acquired in-place leases are classified in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.

We are required to capitalize project costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, predevelopment or construction of a project.  Capitalization of development, redevelopment, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use.  Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income.  Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred.  Should development, redevelopment, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

A property is classified as “held for sale” when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within

one year

; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.  When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as “held for sale”; if (i) the operations and cash flows of the property have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations, and (ii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property after the sale, then its operations, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations.  Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as “held for sale.”

Impairment of long-lived assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for development, construction in progress, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.  The amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  Impairment indicators or triggering events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for development, and construction in progress, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated NOI, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors.  We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.  Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value.  If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used.  We may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.

We use the “held for sale” impairment model for our properties classified as “held for sale.”  The “held for sale” impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model.  Under the “held for sale” impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the amount of the long-lived asset classified as “held for sale” exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.  Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as “held for sale.”

Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Variable interest entity

We consolidate a variable interest entity (“VIE”) if it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary, an evaluation that we perform on an ongoing basis.  A VIE is broadly defined as an entity in which either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support.  We use qualitative analyses when determining whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  Factors considered include, but are not limited to, the purpose and design of the VIE, risks that the VIE was designed to create and pass through, the form of our ownership interest, our representation on the entity’s governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability to participate in policy-making decisions, and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision-making process and to replace us as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable.  Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at the inception of our involvement with the entity or upon reevaluation of the entity’s continuing status as a VIE and determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements.  As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had

no

VIEs consolidated in our financial statements.

Cash and cash equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents.  The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks in accounts that may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limit of

$250,000

.  We have not experienced any losses to date on our invested cash.

Restricted cash

Restricted cash primarily consists of funds held in trust under the terms of our secured bank loans, funds held in escrow related to construction projects, and funds held for various other deposits.

Investments

We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and investments in certain privately held entities and limited partnerships primarily involved in the life science industry.  All of our investments in actively traded public companies are considered “available for sale” and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  Fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of comprehensive income.  The classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date.  The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains or losses classified in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies.  Certain investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method when our interest in the entity is not deemed so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies.  Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our investment initially at cost and adjust the amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment.  Additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than

10%

.  As of

December 31, 2013

and 2012, our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity was less than

10%

.

We monitor each of our equity investments throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, results of clinical trials, capital-raising events, and M&A activities.  Individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions may indicate an impairment exists.  The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements.  If there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate the investment’s fair value.  For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings.

Leasing costs

Costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease.  Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed.

F-12

Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Loan fees and costs

Fees and costs incurred in obtaining long-term financing are capitalized.  Capitalized amounts are amortized over the term of the related loan, and the amortization is classified in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Interest rate swap agreements

We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.  We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities.  We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate swap agreements.  Specifically, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  Our interest rate swap agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on LIBOR primarily in our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans.  We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges.  Our objectives in using interest rate swap agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy.  All of our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges.  Interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount of interest rate swap agreements.

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans.  We recognize our interest rate swap agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value.  The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship.  For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.  Our interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges because they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows.  Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge.  All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly effective” in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates.  We formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy.  We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are “highly effective” in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items.  The ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately recognized in earnings.  While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if swaps did not qualify as “highly effective,” the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.

The fair value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts.  The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.  The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using “significant unobservable inputs” such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.

Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries

Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms.  We classify amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, as an asset in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  We commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the client tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property.

Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred.

Tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments, reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses, property taxes, and other expenses recoverable from client tenants.  Tenant receivables are expected to be collected within

one year

.  We may maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our client tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due.  If a client tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of uncollectible rent and deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent.  As of

December 31, 2013

and


, we had

no

allowance for estimated losses.

As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

94%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.  Approximately

95%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index.  Additionally, approximately

92%

of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures.

Monitoring client tenant credit quality

During the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality of our client tenants by (i) reviewing the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the client tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments. We have a team of employees who, among them, have graduate and undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, and industrial biotechnology and experience in the life science industry, as well as in finance. This life science research team is responsible for assessing and monitoring the credit quality of our tenants and any material changes in credit quality.

Interest income

, respectively.  Interest income is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Share-based compensation expense

We have historically issued two forms of share-based compensation under our equity incentive plan: options to purchase common stock (“options”) and restricted stock awards.  We have not granted any options since 2002.  We recognize all share-based compensation in the income statement based on the grant date fair value.  The fair value of restricted stock awards is recognized based on the market value of the common stock on the grant date and such cost is then recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award (the vesting period).  We are required to compute share-based compensation based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest; as a result, future forfeitures of awards are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments that are forfeited or are anticipated to be forfeited.

Impairment of real estate assets

During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we committed to sell 1124 Columbia Street, located in the Seattle market, a property with

203,817

RSF, rather than to hold it on a long-term basis.  At the time of our commitment to dispose of this asset, 1124 Columbia Street was

97%

occupied and generated approximately

$6.2 million

in annual operating income.  Upon our commitment to sell, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying amount of this asset under the “held for sale” impairment model.  Under the “held for sale” impairment model, we reduced the costs of this asset to our estimate of fair value, based on the anticipated sales price less cost to sell.  The anticipated sales price was based on unobservable inputs, classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately

$4.8 million

during the three months ended September 30, 2012.  In December 2012, we entered into an agreement with a third party to sell 1124 Columbia Street at a price of

$42.6 million

.  As a result, in December 2012, we recognized an additional impairment charge of

$1.6 million

in order to write down the value to approximately

$40.6 million

, based on the revised anticipated sales price less cost to sell.  In January 2013, we completed the sale of this property at a value consistent with our estimated fair value as of December 31, 2012, and no gain or loss was recognized.

During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we committed to sell One Innovation Drive, 377 Plantation Street, and 381 Plantation Street, located in the suburban Greater Boston market, with an aggregate of

300,313

RSF, rather than to hold them on a long-term basis.  At the time of our commitment to dispose of these assets, One Innovation Drive, 377 Plantation Street, and 381 Plantation Street were

92%

occupied and generated approximately

$6.6 million

in annual operating income.  Upon our commitment to sell, we evaluated the recoverability of the amounts of these assets under the “held for sale” impairment model.  Under the “held for sale” impairment model, we reduced the costs of these assets to the anticipated sales price less cost to sell.  The anticipated sales price was based on unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately

$5.0 million

in order to write down the value to approximately

$39.6 million

, based on the anticipated sales price less cost to sell.

During the three months ended September 30, 2011, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately

$1.0 million

related to a

30,000

RSF property, located in the suburban Greater Boston market, to adjust the carrying value to our estimate of fair value less costs to sell.  During the three months ended December 31, 2011, we sold the property for

Current development and redevelopment projects

As of

December 31, 2013

five

ground-up development projects in process in North America, including an unconsolidated joint venture development project, aggregating approximately

1,361,463

RSF.  We also had

Investment in unconsolidated real estate entity

We have a

27.5%

interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that is currently developing a building aggregating

413,536

RSF in the Longwood Medical Area of the Greater Boston market.  The project is

37%

pre-leased to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc.  Our total investment into this project is approximately

$46.6 million

as of

December 31, 2013

.  The total project costs are being funded primarily from a

$213.2

million non-recourse secured construction loan, of which

$87.9 million

was drawn and outstanding at

December 31, 2013

.  The loan bears interest at a rate of

LIBOR

+

3.75%

, with a floor of

5.25%

.  This loan has a maturity date of April 1, 2019, assuming the joint venture exercises its

two

separate one-year options to extend the stated maturity date of April 1, 2017.

We do not qualify as the primary beneficiary of the unconsolidated joint venture since we do not have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts its economic performance.  The decisions that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance require both our consent and that of our partners, including all major operating, investing, and financing decisions, as well as decisions involving major expenditures.  Consequently, we do not consolidate this joint venture, and we account for our investment under the equity method of accounting.

Land undergoing predevelopment activities (additional CIP)

Land undergoing predevelopment activities is classified as construction in progress and is undergoing activities prior to commencement of vertical construction of aboveground building improvements.  We generally will not commence ground-up development of any parcels undergoing predevelopment activities without first securing pre-leasing for such space, except when there is significant market demand for high-quality laboratory/office or tech office facilities.  If vertical aboveground construction is not initiated at completion of predevelopment activities, the land parcel will be classified as land held for development.  Our objective with predevelopment is to reduce the time it takes to deliver projects to prospective client tenants.  Additionally, during predevelopment, we focus on the design of cost-effective buildings with generic laboratory and office infrastructure to accommodate single and multi-tenancy.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we held land undergoing predevelopment activities in North America aggregating

2.7 million

and

2.9 million

RSF, respectively.  Land undergoing predevelopment activities (consisting of Building Information Modeling [BIM or 3-D virtual modeling], design development and construction drawings, sustainability and energy optimization review, budgeting, planning for future site and infrastructure work, and other activities prior to commencement of vertical construction of aboveground shell and core improvements) is also classified as construction in progress.  Project costs are capitalized as a cost of the project during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress.  The largest project included in land undergoing predevelopment consists of substantially all of our

1.2 million

square feet at the Alexandria Center™ at Kendall Square located in East Cambridge, Massachusetts.

We are required to capitalize project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development or construction of a project during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress.  Predevelopment costs generally include the following activities prior to commencement of vertical construction:

Ÿ

Traditional predevelopment costs, including entitlement, design, construction drawings, BIM (3-D virtual modeling), budgeting, sustainability and energy optimization reviews, permitting, and planning for all aspects of the project; and

Ÿ

Site and infrastructure construction costs including belowground site work, utility connections, land grading, drainage, egress and regress access points, foundation, and other costs to prepare the site for vertical construction of aboveground building improvements.  For example, site and infrastructure costs for the

1.2 million

RSF primarily related to 50 Binney Street and 100 Binney Street of the Alexandria Center™ at Kendall Square are classified as predevelopment prior to commencement of vertical construction.

Land held for development

Land held for development represents real estate we plan to develop in the future, but on which, as of each period presented,

no

construction or predevelopment activities were ongoing.  As a result interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs are expensed as incurred.  As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we held land in North America supporting an aggregate of

3.0 million

and

4.7 million

RSF of ground-up development, respectively.

Sales of land parcels

During the

year ended December 31, 2013

, we sold

four

parcels of land for an aggregate price of

$73.3 million

and recognized gains on sale of

$4.8 million

, which included a gain of

$4.4 million

on the sale of

three

parcels in the San Francisco Bay Area market, and a gain of

$391 thousand

on the sale of

one

parcel in Mercer County, New Jersey.  These gains are classified in gains on sales of land parcels below income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we committed to sell a land parcel with

50,000

developable square feet. Prior to this determination, this land parcel was held for future development.  Upon our commitment to sell, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying amount of this land parcel under the “held for sale” impairment model.  Under the “held for sale” impairment model, we reduced the costs of this asset to the anticipated sales price less cost to sell.  The anticipated sales price was based in part on unobservable inputs, classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  As a result, during the three months ended December 31, 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately

$2.1 million

in order to reduce the value to fair value less cost to sell of approximately

$2.0 million

.  In May 2013, we completed the sale of this land parcel at a gain on sale of

$391 thousand

.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, we completed an in-substance partial sale on a portion of our interest in a joint venture, and admitted as a

50%

member Clarion Partners, LLC, resulting in a reduction of our ownership interest from

55%

to

27.5%

.  The transfer of one-half of our 55% ownership interest in this real estate venture to Clarion Partners, LLC, was accounted for as an in-substance partial sale of an interest in the underlying real estate.  In connection with the sale of one-half of our

55%

ownership interest in the land parcel, we received a special distribution of approximately

$22.3 million

, which included the recognition of a

$1.9 million

gain on sale of land and approximately

$5.4 million

from our share of loan refinancing proceeds.  The land parcel we sold in March 2012 did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations since the parcel did not have any significant operations prior to disposition.  Pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains/losses on sales or disposals by REITs required by the SEC, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a REIT that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the income statement.  Accordingly, we classified the

$1.9 million

gain on sale of land below income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income, and included the gain in income from continuing operations attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders in the “control number,” or numerator for computation of earnings per share.

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we completed the sale of a land parcel in San Diego for an aggregate sales price of approximately

$17.3 million

at a gain on sale of

$46 thousand

.  The land parcel sold during the year ended December 31, 2011, did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations because the parcel did not have any significant operations prior to disposition.  Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2011, we classified the

$46 thousand

gain on sale of the land parcel below income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income

Investments

We hold investments in certain publicly traded companies, privately held entities, and limited partnership funds involved primarily in life science and related industries.  Our investments in publicly traded companies are principally marketable equity securities which are accounted for as “available for sale” securities that are carried at their fair values.  Investments in “available for sale” securities with gross unrealized losses as of

December 31, 2013

, had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than

12 months

.  We have the ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of our investment.  We believe that these unrealized losses are temporary, and accordingly have not recognized other-than-temporary impairments related to “available for sale” securities as of

December 31, 2013

$2.2 million

.  See the following page for further discussion.

The unsecured senior notes payable are unsecured obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P., an indirectly

100%

owned subsidiary of the Company.  The unsecured senior notes payable rank equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness.  However, the unsecured senior notes payable are effectively subordinated to existing and future mortgages and other secured indebtedness (to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness) and to all existing and future preferred equity and liabilities, whether secured or unsecured, of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P.

Unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans

On July 26, 2013, we amended our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan to reduce the applicable interest rate margins with respect to the loan thereunder on outstanding borrowings.  We extended the maturity of this loan by one month, and we expect to repay the loan over the next few years.  In addition, on August 30, 2013, we amended our

Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a “Eurocurrency Rate” or a “Base Rate” specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement, plus, in either case, the Applicable Margin.  The “Eurocurrency Rate” specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to (i) the LIBOR or a successor rate thereto as approved by the administrative agent for loans denominated in a LIBOR quoted currency (i.e., U.S. Dollars, Euro, Sterling, or Yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to Canadian dollar banker’s acceptances for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, (iii) the Bank Bill Swap Reference Bid rate for loans denominated in Australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-LIBOR quoted currency (other than Canadian or Australian dollars). The Base Rate specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement means for any day a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the

federal funds rate

plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its “prime rate,” and (c) the

Eurocurrency Rate

The following table summarizes the components of accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):

Some of our properties may contain asbestos, which, under certain conditions, requires remediation.  Although we believe that the asbestos is appropriately contained in accordance with environmental regulations, our practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the development or redevelopment of the affected property.  We recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation (including asbestos) when the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.  In addition, for certain properties, we have not recognized an asset retirement obligation when there is an indeterminate settlement date for the obligation because the period in which we may remediate the obligation may not be estimated with any level of precision to provide for a meaningful estimate of the retirement obligation.  These conditional asset retirement obligations are included in the table above.

Interest rate swap agreements

During the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


, our interest rate swap agreements were used primarily to hedge the variable cash flows associated with certain of our existing LIBOR-based variable-rate debt, including our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is required to be recognized directly in earnings.  During the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


, our interest rate swap agreements were

100%

effective; because of this,

no

hedge ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings.  Changes in fair value, including accrued interest and adjustments for non-performance risk, on the effective portion of our interest rate swap agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.  During the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify approximately

$6.2 million

in accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense as an increase to interest expense.  As of

December 31, 2013

and


, the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements aggregating an asset balance were classified in other assets and those aggregating a liability balance were classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits based upon their respective fair values.  Under our interest rate swap agreements, we have

no

collateral posting requirements.  We had the following outstanding interest rate swap agreements that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk as of

December 31, 2013

(dollars in thousands):

In addition to the interest pay rate, borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2013, under our unsecured senior bank term loans include an Applicable Margin of

Fair value measurements

We are required to disclose fair value information about all financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.  We measure and disclose the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities utilizing a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions.  This hierarchy consists of three broad levels, as follows: (i) quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) “significant other observable inputs,” and (iii) “significant unobservable inputs.”  “Significant other observable inputs” can include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  “Significant unobservable inputs” are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, since there is little, if any, related market activity.  In instances in which the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  There were

no

transfers between the levels in the fair value hierarchy during the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


.

The following tables set forth the assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of

December 31, 2013

and 2012 (in thousands):

Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant receivables, other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits approximate fair value.  Our “available-for-sale” securities and our interest rate swap agreements, respectively, have been recognized at fair value.  The fair values of our secured notes payable, unsecured senior notes payable, unsecured senior line of credit, and unsecured senior bank term loans were estimated using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses of “significant other observable inputs” such as available market information on discount and borrowing rates with similar terms, maturities, and credit ratings.  Because the valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate.  Additionally, the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Earnings per share

We use income from continuing operations attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders as the “control number” in determining whether potential common shares are dilutive or antidilutive to earnings per share.  Pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains or losses on sales or disposals by REITs and earnings per share required by the SEC and the FASB, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a REIT that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and included in the numerator for the computation of earnings per share for income from continuing operations.

The land parcels we sold during the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations because the land parcels did not have significant operations prior to disposition.  Accordingly, for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


, we classified approximately

$4.8 million

,

$1.9 million

, and

$46 thousand

respectively, as gain on sales of land parcels below income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, and included the gain in income from continuing operations attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders in the “control number,” or numerator for computation of earnings per share.

We account for unvested restricted stock awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends as participating securities and include these securities in the computation of earnings per share using the two-class method.  Our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is not a participating security, and is not included in the computation of earnings per share using the two-class method.  Under the two-class method, we allocate net income after preferred stock dividends, preferred stock redemption charge, and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests to common stockholders and unvested restricted stock awards based on their respective participation rights to dividends declared (or accumulated) and undistributed earnings.  Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding determined for the basic earnings per share computation plus the effect of any dilutive securities, including the dilutive effect of stock options using the treasury stock method and potential common shares issuable upon conversion of our

8.00%

unsecured senior convertible notes (“8.00% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes”), during the period the notes were outstanding.

, and


, since the impact was antidilutive to earnings per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders from continuing operations during those periods.

Our calculation of weighted average diluted shares for the year ending December 31, 2011, would have included additional shares related to our

3.70%

Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes if the average market price of our common stock had been higher than the conversion price (

$117.36

as of December 31, 2011).  For the year ended December 31, 2011, the weighted average shares of common stock related to our

3.70%

Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes have been excluded from diluted weighted average shares of common stock because the average market price of our common stock was lower than the conversion price, and the impact of conversion would have been antidilutive to earnings per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders from continuing operations during the period.  None of our

3.70%

Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes were outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Income taxes

We are organized and qualify as a REIT pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.  Under the Code, a REIT that distributes

100%

of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and that meets certain other conditions is not subject to federal income taxes, but could be subject to certain state and local taxes.  We have distributed

100%

or more of our taxable income.  Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.  We file tax returns, including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal, state, and local jurisdictions, including jurisdictions located in the U.S., Canada, India, China, and other international locations.  Our tax returns are subject to examination in various jurisdictions for the calendar years 2009 through 2012.

We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, based solely on its technical merits, with the taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.  The measurement of a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that meets the “more likely than not” threshold is based on a cumulative probability model under which the largest amount of tax benefit recognized is the amount with a greater than

50%

likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information.  As of

December 31, 2013

, there

Income taxes (continued)

were no unrecognized tax benefits.  We do not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

Interest expense and penalties, if any, would be recognized in the first period during which the interest or penalty would begin accruing, according to the provisions of the relevant tax law at the applicable statutory rate of interest.  We did not incur any material tax-related interest expense or penalties for the years ended

We distributed all of our REIT taxable income in


and


, and as a result, did not incur federal income tax in those years on such income.  For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, we expect our distributions to exceed our REIT taxable income, and as a result, do not expect to incur federal income tax on such income.  We expect to finalize our 2013 REIT taxable income in connection with our 2013 federal income tax return, which will be prepared and filed with the IRS in 2014.

The income tax treatment of distributions and dividends declared on our common stock, our Series C Preferred Stock, our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and our Series E Preferred Stock for the years ended

December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

was as follows (unaudited):

Our tax return for 2013 is due on or before September 15, 2014, assuming we file for an extension of the due date.  The taxability information presented for our dividends paid in 2013 is based upon management’s estimate.  Our tax returns for previous tax years have not been examined by the IRS.  Consequently, the taxability of distributions and dividends is subject to change.

Commitments and contingencies

Employee retirement savings plan

We have a retirement savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code whereby our employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to their respective retirement accounts in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowed under the Internal Revenue Code.  In addition to employee contributions, we have elected to provide company discretionary profit sharing contributions (subject to statutory limitations), which amounted to approximately

$1.6 million

,

$1.4 million

, and

$1.3 million

, for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


, respectively.  Employees who participate in the plan are immediately vested in their contributions and in the contributions made on their behalf by the Company.

Concentration of credit risk

We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial institutions.  The combined account balances at each institution periodically exceed

FDIC insurance coverage of

$250,000

, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk

related to amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.  We have not experienced any losses to date on our invested cash.

In order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate swap agreements, our interest rate swap agreements are spread among various counterparties.  As of

December 31, 2013

, the largest aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty was

$250.0 million

.  If one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate swap agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable-rate LIBOR-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated.

We are dependent on rental income from relatively few client tenants in the life science industry.  The inability of any single client tenant to make its lease payments could adversely affect our operations.  As of

December 31, 2013

, we had


leases with a total of


client tenants, and


, or

43.9%

, of our


properties were each leased to a single client tenant.  As of

December 31, 2013

, our

three

largest client tenants accounted for approximately

14.4%

of our aggregate ABR, or

6.7%

,

3.9%

, and

3.8%

, respectively.

Commitments

As of

December 31, 2013

, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and generic life science infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases approximated

$272.0 million

.  We expect payments for these obligations to occur over

one

to

three

years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time.  We are also committed to funding approximately

$46.7 million

for certain investments over the next several years.  In addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations of

$13.9 million

primarily related to our construction management requirements.

We have minimum development requirements under project development agreements with government entities in some of our future value-creation projects.  At

December 31, 2013

, we have land and land improvements with an aggregate book value of approximately

$18.8 million

where we have construction commitment obligations aggregating approximately

300,000

RSF that need to be fulfilled by 2016.  If we do not meet, extend, or eliminate these commitments, we may default under our existing agreements.  The government entities in turn also have certain obligations to us under those project development agreements.  We are working with these entities to fulfill or amend certain existing obligations in a mutually beneficial manner.

A

100%

owned subsidiary of the Company previously executed a ground lease, as ground lessee, for certain property in New York City.  The West Tower of the Alexandria Center™ for Life Science – New York City is being constructed on such ground-leased property.  In November 2012, we commenced vertical construction of the West Tower.  The ground lease provides that substantial completion of the West Tower occur by October 31, 2015, and requires satisfying conditions that include substantially completed construction in accordance with the plans.  The ground lease also provides that by October 31, 2016, the ground lessee shall obtain a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy for the core and shell of both the East Tower of the Alexandria Center™ for Life Science – New York City and the West Tower.  In each case, the target dates above are subject to force majeure, to contractual cure rights, to other legal remedies available to ground lessees generally, and to change for any reason by agreement between the two parties under the ground lease.

Stockholders’ equity

Secondary offering of common stock

In May 2013, we sold approximately

7.6 million

shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including

1.0 million

shares issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of

$73.50

per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately

$534.5 million

(after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering costs).

In May 2011, we sold

6.3 million

shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including

751 thousand

shares issued upon partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option).  The shares were issued at a price of

$75.50

per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately

$451.5 million

(after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering costs).

“At the market” common stock offering program

In June 2012, we established an “at the market” common stock offering program under which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of

$250.0 million

of our common stock through our sales agents, BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, during a three-year period.  During the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold an aggregate of

1.4 million

shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately

$100.0 million

at an average stock price of

$73.15

and net proceeds of approximately

$97.9 million

, including commissions and other expenses of approximately

$2.1 million

.  Net proceeds from the sales were used initially to reduce the outstanding balance on our unsecured senior line of credit or other borrowings, and for general corporate purposes.  During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, we did not issue any stock under the “at the market” common stock offering program.  As of

December 31, 2013

, approximately

$150.0 million

of our common stock remained available for issuance under the “at the market” common stock offering program.

6.45% Series E Preferred Stock offering

In March 2012, we completed a public offering of

5.2 million

shares of our 6.45% series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock (“Series E Preferred Stock”).  The shares were issued at a price of

$25.00

per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately

$124.9

million (after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering costs).  The proceeds were initially used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit.  We then borrowed funds under our unsecured senior line of credit to redeem our Series C Preferred Stock in April 2012.  The dividends on our Series E Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance.  We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of

6.45%

, or

$1.6125

per share.  Our Series E

Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions, and is not redeemable before March 15, 2017, except to preserve our status as a REIT.  On and after March 15, 2017, we may, at our option, redeem the Series E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time for cash at a redemption price of

$25.00

per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock up to, but excluding, the redemption date.  In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control, we may, at our option, redeem the Series E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within


days after the first date on which such change of control occurred, by paying

$25.00

per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends up to, but excluding, the date of redemption.  Investors in our Series E Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights.

8.375% Series C Preferred Stock redemption

In April 2012, we redeemed all

5.2 million

outstanding shares of our Series C Preferred Stock at a price equal to

$25.00

per share, or approximately

$129.6 million

in aggregate, and paid

$0.5234375

per share, representing accumulated and unpaid dividends to the redemption date on such shares.  We announced the redemption and recognized a preferred stock redemption charge of approximately

$6.0 million

to net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders in March 2012, related to the write-off of original issuance costs of the Series C Preferred Stock.

7.00% Series D Convertible Preferred Stock

As of December 31, 2013, we had

10.0 million

shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding.  The dividends on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance.  We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of

$1.75

per share.  Our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions.  We are not allowed to redeem our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, except to preserve our status as a REIT.  Investors in our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights.  On or after April 20, 2013, we may, at our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically converted if the closing sale price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds

150%

of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for at least


trading days in a period of


consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to our issuance of a press release announcing the exercise of our conversion option. Holders of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their outstanding shares initially at a conversion rate of

0.2477

shares of common stock per

$25.00

liquidation preference, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately

$100.93

per share of common stock.  The conversion rate for the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common stock in excess of

$0.78

per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2013, the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock had a conversion rate of approximately

0.2480

Stock plan

We have a stock option and incentive plan for the purpose of attracting and retaining the highest-quality personnel, providing for additional incentives, and promoting the success of our Company by providing employees the opportunity to acquire common stock pursuant to (i) options to purchase common stock and (ii) share awards.  In May 2010, we amended and restated our stock option and incentive plan to increase the number of shares reserved for the grant of awards, implement a fungible reserve, and extend the term of the stock plan until May 2020, among other amendments.  As of

December 31, 2013

, a total of

1,059,340

shares were reserved for the granting of future options and share awards under the stock plan.

Options under our plan have been granted at prices that are equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant and expire

10 years

after the date of grant.  We have not granted any stock options since 2002.  There was

no

stock option activity during the year ended

In addition, the stock plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees and non-employee directors.  A share award is an award of common stock that (i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may be subject to the risk of forfeiture under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Shares issued generally vest over a three-year period from the date of issuance, and the sale of the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.  The unearned portion of these awards is amortized as stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Noncontrolling interests represent the third-party interests in certain entities in which we have a controlling interest.  These entities owned


properties and

three

development parcels as of

December 31, 2013

, and are included in our consolidated financial statements.  Noncontrolling interests are adjusted for additional contributions and distributions, the proportionate share of the net earnings or losses, and other comprehensive income or loss.  Distributions, profits, and losses related to these entities are allocated in accordance with the respective operating agreements.

Certain of our noncontrolling interests have the right to require us to redeem their ownership interests in the respective entities.  We classify these ownership interests in the entities as redeemable noncontrolling interests outside of total equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Redeemable noncontrolling interests are adjusted for additional contributions and distributions, the proportionate share of the net earnings or losses, and other comprehensive income or loss.  Distributions, profits, and losses related to these entities are allocated in accordance with the respective operating agreements.  If the amount of a redeemable noncontrolling interest is less than the maximum redemption value at the balance sheet date, such amount is adjusted to the maximum redemption value.  Subsequent declines in the redemption value are recognized only to the extent that previous increases have been recognized.  As of

December 31, 2013

and


, our redeemable noncontrolling interest balances were approximately

$14.4 million

and

$14.6 million

, respectively.  Our remaining noncontrolling interests, aggregating approximately

$47.7 million

and

$46.6 million

as of

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, do not have rights to require us to purchase their ownership interests and are classified in total equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
