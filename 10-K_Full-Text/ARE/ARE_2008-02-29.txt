ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal
income tax purposes.  We are engaged
principally in the ownership, operation, management, selective development,
redevelopment and acquisition of life science properties.  Our properties are designed and improved for
lease primarily to institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit
institutions), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, life science product,
service, and translational medicine entities, as well as governmental
agencies.  Our properties leased to
tenants in the life science industry typically consist of buildings containing
scientific research and development laboratories and other improvements that
are generic to tenants operating in the life science industry.  We refer to such properties as “life science
properties”.  As of December 31,
2007, we had 166 properties (162 properties located in ten states in the United
States and four properties located in Canada) containing approximately 12.1
million rentable square feet of office/laboratory space plus approximately 1.6
million rentable square feet undergoing ground-up development and an imbedded
pipeline for future ground-up development approximating 8.7 million developable
square feet.

Business and growth strategy

We focus our property operations and investment activities principally
in the following life science markets:

Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science industry
and reflects our focus on regional, national and international tenants with
substantial financial and operational resources.  For a more detailed description of our
properties and tenants, see “Item 2. Properties.”  We have an experienced Board of Directors and
are led by a senior management team with extensive experience in both the real
estate and life science industries.


We seek to maximize growth in funds from operations (“FFO”)
and cash available for distribution to our stockholders through the ownership,
operation, management, selective development, redevelopment and acquisition of
life science properties, as well as management of our balance sheet.  See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” for a discussion of
how we compute and view FFO, as well as a discussion of other measures of cash
flow. In particular, we seek to increase FFO and cash available for
distribution by:

We seek to achieve a significant component of our growth primarily from
internal growth through selective development and redevelopment, favorable
lease terms and successful leasing activity. In addition, our internal growth
strategy is supplemented with external growth through selective acquisition of
properties in our target life science cluster markets.

Internal
growth

We seek to achieve internal growth from several sources. For example,
we seek to:

Development

We seek to acquire strategic land parcels in key life science cluster
markets to enhance our growth through ground-up development projects.  Our development strategy is primarily to
pursue selective projects where we expect to achieve investment returns that
will equal or exceed our returns on acquisitions.  We generally have undertaken ground-up
development projects only if our investment in infrastructure will be substantially
made for generic, rather than tenant specific, improvements. As of December 31,
2007, we had six parcels of land undergoing ground-up development approximating
1.6 million rentable square feet of office/laboratory space and an imbedded
pipeline for future ground-up development approximating 8.7 million developable
square feet of office/laboratory space.

Redevelopment

We seek to enhance our growth by redeveloping existing office,
warehouse or shell space as generic laboratory space that can be leased at
higher rates.  As of December 31,
2007, we had approximately 775,000 rentable square feet undergoing
redevelopment at 16 properties.  In
addition to properties undergoing redevelopment, as of December 31, 2007,
our asset base contained imbedded opportunities for a future permanent change
of use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating
approximately 1.8 million rentable square feet.


Growth
through international expansion

The biopharmaceutical
industry is an international industry. 
As such, we intend to continue expansion in Canada, Europe, and
Asia.  We believe that expansion into
worldwide markets outside the United States represents a natural extension
of our strategy to continue to be the leading provider of real estate to the
broad and diverse life science industry. 
Our international expansion strategy mirrors our focus in the United
States on supply constrained markets with political, economic or physical
constraints to new development as well as proximity to centers of life science
research and technology transfer.   We
believe that our established client tenant relationships, our contacts in the
life science industry, our underwriting of markets and investments and our strategic
alliances with political and economic development entities will assist us in
expanding internationally.

Acquisitions

We seek to
identify and acquire high quality life science properties in our target life
science cluster markets.  Critical evaluation
of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our
acquisition strategy.  When evaluating
acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the
properties, including:

Tenants

As of December 31, 2007, we
had 391 leases with a total of 323 tenants, and 90 of our 166 properties were
single-tenant properties.  Our three
largest tenants accounted for approximately 13.4% of our aggregate annualized
base rent, or approximately 6.9%, 3.5% and 3.0%, respectively. None of our
tenants represented more than 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31,
2007.

Competition

In general, other
life science properties are located in close proximity to our properties. The
amount of rentable space available in any market could have a material effect
on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can earn.  In addition, we compete for investment
opportunities with insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private
equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies, other REITs,
and owner/occupants. Many of these entities have substantially greater
financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more than us or accept
more risk than we are willing to accept. 
These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the
creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic concentration of their
investments.  Competition may also reduce
the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase
the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.  Competition in acquiring existing properties
and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other REITs, has
been very strong over the past several years. We believe we have differentiated
ourselves from our competitors, as we are the largest owner, manager and
developer of life science properties, in key life science markets.

Financing
and working capital

We believe that
cash provided by operations, our unsecured line of credit and our unsecured
term loan will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements.  We generally expect to finance future
development, redevelopment and acquisition of properties through our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan and, then, to refinance some or all of
that indebtedness periodically with additional equity or debt capital.  We may also issue shares of our common stock,
preferred stock or interests in our subsidiaries to fund future operations.  See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Liquidity and Capital
Resources-Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan.”


We seek to
maintain a balance between the amounts of our fixed and variable rate debt with
a view to moderating our exposure to interest rate risk.  We also use financial instruments, such as
interest rate swap agreements, to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable
interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and our
unsecured term loan.  Our interest rate
swap agreements require an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal or “notional amount.”  Interest received under our current interest
rate swap agreements is based on the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate,
or LIBOR.  See “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation-Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a more complete discussion of
our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan, interest rate swap
agreements and other outstanding indebtedness.

Preferred
securities

We may consider
from time to time the issuance of additional series of preferred stock that are
senior to our common stock.  At December 31,
2007, we had preferred stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of
approximately $129.6 million.  The
preferred stock has general preference rights with respect to liquidation and
quarterly distributions.  In June 2004,
we completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our 8.375% Series C
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock with aggregate proceeds of approximately
$124.0 million.  In July 2004, we
redeemed all 1,543,500 outstanding shares of our 9.50% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock at an aggregate redemption price of approximately
$38.6 million.  In March 2007, we
redeemed all 2,300,000 outstanding shares of our 9.10% Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock at an aggregate redemption price of approximately
$57.5 million.  Future redemptions or
repurchases of our preferred securities may occur after their respective call
dates.  See “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Liquidity
and Capital Resources- Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements.”

that applies to all of our employees. 
Its receipt and review by each employee is documented and verified
annually.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Financing our future growth plan or refinancing
existing debt maturities could be impacted by negative capital market
conditions

Recently,
financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty. While
this condition has occurred most visibly within the “subprime” mortgage lending
sector of the credit market, liquidity has tightened in overall financial
markets, including the debt and equity capital markets. Consequently, there is
greater uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit market in order
to attract financing on reasonable terms. Our ability to finance our pending or
new acquisitions, development and redevelopment projects, as well as our
ability to refinance debt maturities could be adversely affected by our
inability to secure permanent financing on reasonable terms, if at all.


We may not be able to obtain additional capital to further our business
objectives

Our ability to
develop, redevelop or acquire properties depends upon our ability to obtain
capital.  Periodically, the real estate
industry experiences reduced supplies of favorably-priced equity or debt capital,
which decreases the level of new investment activity by publicly-traded real
estate companies.  A prolonged period in
which we cannot effectively access the public equity or debt markets may result
in heavier reliance on alternative financing sources to undertake new
investments.  An inability to obtain
equity or debt capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from
acquiring, financing and completing desirable investments, which could
adversely affect our business.  Also, the
issuance of additional shares of capital stock or interests in subsidiaries to
fund future operations could dilute the ownership of then existing
stockholders.

Possible future sales of shares of our common stock could adversely
affect its market price

We cannot predict the
effect, if any, of future sales of shares of our common stock on the market
price of our common stock from time to time. 
Sales of substantial amounts of capital stock (including common stock
issued upon the exercise of stock options, upon conversion of convertible debt
securities or redemption of preferred stock), or the perception that such sales
may occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common
stock.

We have reserved
for issuance to our officers, directors and employees pursuant to our Amended
and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan that number of shares of our
common stock that equals 12% of the total number of shares outstanding at any
time, provided that in no event may the number of shares of our common stock available
for issuance under the plan exceed 3,000,000 shares at any time. As of December 31,
2007, a total of 973,881 shares were reserved for issuance under our 1997 Stock
Award and Incentive Plan.

As of December 31,
2007, options to purchase 255,345 shares of our common stock were outstanding,
all of which were exercisable.  We have
filed a registration statement with respect to the issuance of shares of our
common stock pursuant to grants under our equity incentive plan.  In addition, any shares issued under our
equity incentive plan will be available for sale in the public market from time
to time without restriction by persons who are not our “affiliates” (as defined
in Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act of 1933).  Affiliates will be able to sell shares of our
common stock pursuant to exemptions from registration requirements or upon
registration.

If our revenues are less than our expenses, we may have to borrow
additional funds and we may not be able to make distributions to our
stockholders

If our properties
do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including
debt service and other capital expenditures, we may have to borrow additional
amounts to cover fixed costs and cash flow needs.  This could adversely affect our ability to
make distributions to our stockholders. 
Factors that could adversely affect the revenues from, and the values
of, our properties include:

In addition, if a lease at a property is not a triple net lease, we
will have greater expenses associated with that property and greater exposure
to increases in such expenses. 
Significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes,
insurance and maintenance costs, generally are fixed and do not decrease when
revenues at the related property decrease.


Our distributions to stockholders may decline at any time

We may not continue our current level of distributions to our
stockholders. Our Board of Directors will determine future distributions based
on a number of factors, including:

We could become highly leveraged and our debt service obligations could
increase

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we
may incur.  Therefore, we could become
highly leveraged.  This would result in
an increase in our debt service obligations that could adversely affect our
cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.  Higher leverage could also increase the risk
of default on our debt obligations.

We may not be able to sell our properties quickly to raise money

Investments in real estate are relatively illiquid.  Accordingly, we may not be able to sell our
properties when we desire or at acceptable prices in response to changes in
economic or other conditions.  In
addition, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell properties held
for fewer than four years.  These limitations
on our ability to sell our properties may adversely affect our cash flows and
our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Our debt service obligations may have adverse consequences on our
business operations

We use debt to finance our operations, including development,
redevelopment and acquisitions of properties. Our use of debt may have adverse
consequences, including the following:

As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness
of approximately $1.2 billion, secured by 73 properties and 6 land development
parcels, and outstanding debt under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured
term loan of approximately $1.1 billion. In addition, as of December 31,
2007, we had outstanding $460 million of 3.70% convertible unsecured notes.

Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict our
ability to engage in some business activities

Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan facilities contain
customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that,
among other things:

·

restrict our ability to
  incur additional indebtedness;

·

restrict our ability to
  make certain investments;

·

restrict our ability to
  merge with another company;


·

restrict our ability to make distributions
to stockholders;

·

require us to maintain financial coverage
ratios; and

·

require us to maintain a pool of
unencumbered assets approved by the lenders.

These restrictions could cause us to default on our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan or negatively affect our
operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

If interest rates rise, our debt service costs will increase

Our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and certain other
borrowings bear interest at variable rates, and we may incur additional
variable rate debt in the future. 
Increases in market interest rates would increase our interest expense
under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing
existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt. 
Accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our financial
position and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may
adversely affect results of operations

The interest rate swap agreements we use to manage some of our exposure
to interest rate volatility involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties
may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements.  In addition, these arrangements may not be
effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.  These risk factors may lead to failure to
hedge effectively against changes in interest rates and therefore may adversely
affect our results of operations.

Proposed accounting rule changes for certain
convertible debt instruments could increase significantly the non-cash interest
expense associated with our outstanding convertible notes and adversely affect
our results of operations

In August 2007, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) released for public comment a proposed FASB Staff
Position (“FSP”) that would affect the accounting treatment for convertible
debt instruments, such as our outstanding unsecured convertible notes, that may
be settled wholly or partially in cash. The proposed FSP would require that
instruments within its scope be separated into their liability and equity
components at initial recognition by recording the liability component at the
fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity
component and attributing the remaining proceeds from issuance to the equity
component. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over
its initial fair value would be amortized to interest expense using the
interest method.  In addition, the
proposed FSP requires that interest cost for our unsecured convertible notes be
accounted for based on our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The FASB is
expected to begin its redeliberations of the guidance in the proposed FSP in
early 2008. The proposed FSP may be effective for reporting periods as early as
2008 and is expected to be applied retrospectively to prior periods.  If the FSP is issued as proposed, we expect
an increase in our non-cash interest expense associated with our $460 million
aggregate principal amount outstanding of convertible notes that were issued in
January 2007, including non-cash interest expense for prior periods as a
result of its proposed retrospective application. We believe the additional
non-cash interest expense we may recognize under the proposed FSP would result
in an increase to interest expense as our estimated nonconvertible debt
borrowing rate is higher than the current contractual coupon rate of 3.70% on
our $460 million unsecured convertible notes. 
For example, under the proposed FSP, if the interest rate for our
nonconvertible borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% higher than the current
contractual coupon rate of 3.70% on our unsecured convertible notes, our
non-cash interest expense included in net income for the year ended December 31,
2007 would increase by approximately 8% to 9%. The proposed FSP, if adopted as
proposed, will also increase our non-cash interest in future periods during
which our unsecured convertible notes remain outstanding. We are currently
evaluating our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate and the overall impact of the
proposed FSP on our consolidated financial statements. The impact of the
proposed FSP on our consolidated financial statements could be influenced by
certain factors, including the ultimate outcome of the final rules under
the proposed FSP.

Our real estate developments have and will continue to increase in the
future

We will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire land for future
ground-up development and we will continue to initiate ground-up development
projects.  As of December 31, 2007,
we had approximately 1.6 million rentable square feet undergoing ground-up
development and we had an imbedded pipeline for future ground-up development
approximating 8.7 million developable square feet.  Our existing projects undergoing ground-up
development and future ground-up development projects increase our risk of
unsuccessful real estate development activities which may have an adverse
affect on our business.


We may be unsuccessful with our real estate development activities

A significant component of our current and future internal growth is
through the ground-up development of 
space for lease. Our success with our development projects depends on
many risks that may adversely affect our business, including those associated
with:

In addition, development activities, regardless of
whether they are ultimately successful, typically require a substantial portion
of management’s time and attention.  This
may distract management from focusing on other operational activities.  If we are unable to complete development
projects successfully, our business may be adversely affected.

We have spaces available for redevelopment that may be difficult to
redevelop or successfully lease to tenants

A key component of our internal growth is through the redevelopment of
existing office, warehouse or shell space as generic laboratory space that can
be leased at higher rates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
initiate the redevelopment of spaces or complete spaces undergoing
redevelopment.  Redevelopment activities
subject us to many risks, including delays in permitting, financing
availability, engaging contractors, availability and pricing of materials and
labor and other redevelopment uncertainties. 
In addition, there can be no assurance that, upon completion, we will be
able to successfully lease the space or lease the space at rental rates at or
above the returns on our investment anticipated by our stockholders.

Improvements to life science properties are significantly more costly
than traditional office space

Our properties contain generic infrastructure improvements that are
significantly more costly than other property types.  Although we have historically been able to
recover the additional investment in generic infrastructure improvements
through higher rental rates, there is the risk that we will not be able to
continue to do so in the future. Typical improvements include:

We may have difficulty managing our growth

We expect to continue to grow by selectively developing, redeveloping
and acquiring additional properties in our key life science cluster
markets.  To manage our growth
effectively, we must successfully integrate new properties into our existing
operations.  We may not succeed with the
integration.  In addition, we may not
effectively manage new properties, and new properties may not perform as
expected.  Our business could be
adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in managing our growth.

We may not be able to acquire properties or operate them successfully

Our success depends in large part upon our ability to acquire
additional properties on satisfactory terms and to operate them successfully.  If we are unable to do so, our business could
be adversely affected.  In addition, the
acquisition of life science properties generally involves a higher per square
foot price than the acquisition of traditional office properties.


The acquisition, ownership and operation of real
estate is subject to many risks that may adversely affect our business and our
ability to make payments to our stockholders, including the risks that:

If we encounter any of these risks, our business
and our ability to make payments to our stockholders could be adversely
affected.

We face substantial competition in our target markets

The significant competition for business in our target markets could
have an adverse effect on our operations. 
We compete for investment opportunities with:

Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources
than we do and may be able to pay more than we can or accept more risk than we
are willing to accept.  These entities
may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant
or the geographic concentration of their investments.  Competition may also reduce the number of
suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the
bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.

Poor economic conditions in our markets could adversely affect our
business

Our properties are located in the following markets:

As a result of our geographic concentration, we depend upon the local
economic conditions in these markets, including local real estate conditions.  We are, therefore, subject to increased
exposure (positive or negative) to economic, tax, currency fluctuations and
other competitive factors specific to markets in confined geographic
areas.  Our operations may also be
affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these
markets.  An economic downturn in any of
these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make
distributions to stockholders.  We cannot
assure you that these markets will continue to grow or will remain favorable to
the life science industry.


We are largely dependent on the life science industry for revenues from
lease payments

In general, our strategy is to invest primarily in properties used by
tenants in the life science industry. 
Our business could be adversely affected if the life science industry
experiences an economic downturn or migrates from the U.S. to other countries.  Because of our industry focus, events within
the life science industry may have a more pronounced effect on our ability to
make distributions to our stockholders than if we had more diversified
investments.  Also, some of our
properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry tenant
and could require modification before we are able to re-lease vacant space to
another life science industry tenant. 
Generally, our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional
office tenants without significant expenditures on renovations.

Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations in future leases
and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and
the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated
and the increases are proposed.

Our tenants may not be able to pay us if they are unsuccessful in
discovering, developing, making or selling their products and technologies

Our life science industry tenants are subject to a number of risks,
including the following, any one or more of which may adversely affect their
ability to make rental payments to us:

·

Some of our tenants developing potential
drugs may find that their drugs are not effective, or may even be harmful, when
tested in humans.

·

Some of our tenants depend on
availability of reimbursements from the government or private insurance plans
and reimbursements may decrease in the future.

·

Some of our tenants may not be able to manufacture
their drugs economically, even if such drugs are proven through human clinical
trials to be safe and effective in humans.

·

Drugs that are developed and manufactured
by some of our tenants require regulatory approval, including FDA approval,
prior to being made, marketed, sold and used. 
The regulatory approval process to manufacture and market drugs is
costly, typically takes several years, requires the expenditure of substantial
resources and is often unpredictable.  A
tenant may fail or experience significant delays in obtaining these approvals.

·

Some of our tenants and their licensors
require patent, copyright or trade secret protection to develop, make, market
and sell their products and technologies. 
A tenant may be unable to commercialize its products or technologies if
patents covering such products or technologies do not issue, or are successfully
challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented by third parties, or if a
tenant fails to obtain licenses to the discoveries of third parties necessary
to commercialize its products or technologies.

·

A drug made by a tenant may not be well
accepted by doctors and patients, or may be less effective or accepted than
competitor’s drugs, or may be subsequently recalled from the market, even if it
is successfully developed, proven safe and effective in human clinical trials,
manufactured and the requisite regulatory approvals are obtained.

·

Some of our tenants require significant
funding to develop and commercialize their products and technologies, which
funding must be obtained from private investors, the public markets, companies
in the life science industry or federal, state and local governments.  Such funding may become unavailable or
difficult to obtain.

·

Even with sufficient funding, some of our
tenants may not be able to discover or identify potential drug targets in
humans, or potential drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or
technologies which are commercially useful in the discovery or identification
of potential drug targets or drugs.

We cannot assure you that our tenants will be able to develop, make,
market or sell their products and technologies due to the risks inherent in the
life science industry.  Any tenant that
is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above, may have
difficulty making rental payments to us.


Our
inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire
may significantly affect our business

Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and
reimbursement of operating expense under our leases. If a tenant experiences a
downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable
to make timely payments under its lease. 
Also, when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate
early, we may not be able to re-lease the space.  Even if tenants decide to renew or lease
space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant
improvements, concessions and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us
than current lease terms.  Consequently,
we could lose the cash flow from the affected properties, which could
negatively impact our business.  We may
have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our mortgage
payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected
properties.  As of December 31,
2007, leases at our properties representing approximately 8.0% and 8.5% of the
aggregate leased square footage of our properties were scheduled to expire in
2008 and 2009, respectively.

The inability of a tenant to pay us rent could adversely affect our
business

Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and
reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases.  If our tenants, especially significant
tenants, fail to make rental payments under their leases, our financial
condition, cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders
could be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2007, we had 391 leases with a total of 323
tenants, and 90 of our 166 properties were single-tenant properties.  Our three largest tenants accounted for
approximately 13.4% of our aggregate annualized base rent, or approximately
6.9%, 3.5% and 3.0%, respectively. “Annualized base rent” means the annualized
fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2007, using rental
revenues calculated on a straight-line basis in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  Annualized base rent does not include
reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and
other operating expenses, substantially all of which are borne by the tenants
in the case of triple net leases.

The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely
affect the income produced by a property. 
If any of our tenants becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of its
bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court may
authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us.  Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid
future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be
substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant’s
lease.  Any shortfall in rent payments
could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to
our stockholders.

Our U.S. government tenants may not receive annual budget
appropriations, which could adversely affect their ability to pay us

U.S. government tenants may be subject to annual budget
appropriations.  If one of our U.S.
government tenants fails to receive its annual budget appropriation, it might
not be able to make its lease payments to us. 
In addition, defaults under leases with federal government tenants are
governed by federal statute and not by state eviction or rent deficiency
laws.  All of our leases with U.S.
government tenants provide that the government tenant may terminate the lease
under certain circumstances.  As of December 31,
2007, leases with U.S. government tenants at our properties accounted for
approximately 3.0% of our aggregate annualized base rent.

We could be held liable for damages resulting from our tenants’ use of
hazardous materials

Many of our life science industry tenants engage in research and
development activities that involve controlled use of hazardous materials,
chemicals and biological and radioactive compounds.  In the event of contamination or injury from
the use of these hazardous materials, we could be held liable for damages that
result.  This liability could exceed our
resources and any recovery available through any applicable environmental
remediation insurance coverage, and could adversely affect our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders.

Together with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state and local
laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and
disposal of hazardous materials and waste products.  Failure to comply with, or changes in, these
laws and regulations could adversely affect our business or our tenants’
business and their ability to make rental payments to us.


Our
properties may have defects that are unknown to us

Although we review the physical condition of our properties before they
are acquired, and on a periodic basis after acquisition, any of our properties
may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could adversely
affect the property’s value or revenue potential.

We may incur significant costs complying with the Americans With
Disabilities Act and similar laws

Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, places of public
accommodation and/or commercial facilities are required to meet federal
requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  We may be required to make substantial capital
expenditures at our properties to comply with this law.  In addition, our noncompliance could result
in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.

A number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations
exist regarding access by disabled persons. 
These regulations may require modifications to our properties or may
affect future renovations.  This may
limit the overall returns on our investments.

We believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with the
present requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act and similar laws.

We may
incur significant costs if we fail to comply with laws or if laws change

Our properties are subject to many federal, state and local regulatory
requirements and to state and local fire, life-safety and other requirements.  If we do not comply with all of these
requirements, we may have to pay fines to governmental authorities or damage
awards to private litigants.  We believe
that our properties are currently in compliance with all of these regulatory
requirements.  We do not know whether
these requirements will change or whether new requirements will be
imposed.  Changes in these regulatory
requirements could require us to make significant unanticipated
expenditures.  These expenditures could
have an adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders.

We could
incur significant costs complying with environmental laws

Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations may require
us, as a current or prior owner or operator of real estate, to investigate and
clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products released at or
from any of our properties.  The cost of
investigating and cleaning up contamination could be substantial and could
exceed the amount of any environmental remediation insurance coverage available
to us.  In addition, the presence of
contamination, or the failure to properly clean it up, may adversely affect our
ability to lease or sell an affected property, or to borrow funds using that
property as collateral.

Under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay
governmental entities or third parties for property damage and for
investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties relating to
contaminated properties regardless of whether we knew of or caused the
contamination.  Even if more than one
party may have been responsible for the contamination, we may be held
responsible for all of the clean-up costs. 
In addition, third parties may sue us for damages and costs resulting from
environmental contamination or jointly responsible parties may contest their
responsibility or be financially unable to pay their share of such costs.

Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of
asbestos-containing materials.  These
laws may impose fines and penalties on us for the release of
asbestos-containing materials and may allow third parties to seek recovery from
us for personal injury from exposure to asbestos fibers.  We have detected asbestos-containing
materials at some of our properties, but we do not expect that it will result
in material environmental costs or liabilities to us.

Environmental laws and regulations also require the removal or
upgrading of certain underground storage tanks and regulate:


Many of our tenants
routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at
our properties.  Environmental laws and
regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from
these activities.  Environmental
liabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to
us.  We require our tenants to comply
with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any
related liabilities.

Independent environmental
consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental assessments at all
of our properties.  We intend to use
consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future
acquisitions.  This type of assessment
generally includes a site inspection, interviews and a public records review,
but no subsurface sampling.  These
assessments and certain additional investigations of our properties have not to
date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material
adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

The additional investigations have included, as appropriate:

Nevertheless, it is
possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed, or that
assessments on future acquisitions, will not reveal all environmental
liabilities.  Consequently, there may be
material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware that may result in
substantial costs to us or our tenants and that could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

Our
insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses

If we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not covered by
insurance or that exceeds our insurance policy limits, we could lose the
capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues from
that property. In addition, we could continue to be obligated on any mortgage
indebtedness or other obligations related to the affected properties.  We carry comprehensive liability, fire,
extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties.  We have obtained earthquake insurance for all
of our properties because many of them are located in the vicinity of active
earthquake faults.  We also carry
environmental remediation insurance and have title insurance policies on all of
our properties.  We obtain our title
insurance policies when we acquire the property, with each policy covering an
amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly, any
of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value
of the related property.

We believe that our insurance policy specifications, insured limits and
deductibles are consistent with or superior to those customarily carried for
similar properties.  Our tenants are also
required to maintain comprehensive insurance, including liability and casualty
insurance, that is customarily obtained for similar properties. There are,
however, certain types of losses that we and our tenants do not generally
insure against because they are uninsurable or because it is not economical to
insure against them.  In the current market,
there have recently been substantial increases in the premium cost of property
and liability insurance. The availability of coverage against certain types of
losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold, has become more limited and, when
available, is at a significantly higher premium cost. We cannot predict whether
insurance coverage against terrorism or toxic mold will remain available for
our properties because insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against
such losses or, if offered, such coverage may become prohibitively
expensive.  Many, but not all, of our
properties are low-rise buildings. Toxic mold has not presented any material
problems at any of our properties.

Terrorist
attacks may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and
could decrease the value of our assets

Terrorist attacks such as those that took place on September 11,
2001, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating
results. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity,
which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties.  To the extent that future attacks impact our
tenants, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including
their ability to continue to honor their lease obligations.


The loss
of services of any of our senior executive officers could adversely affect us

We depend upon the services of relatively few executive officers.  The loss of services of any one of them may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.  We use the extensive personal and business
relationships that members of our management have developed over time with
owners of life science properties and with major life science industry
tenants.  We cannot assure you that our
senior executive officers will remain employed with us.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be taxed at corporate rates
and would not be able to take certain deductions when computing our taxable
income

If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify as a REIT:

As a result of any
additional tax liability, we might need to borrow funds or liquidate certain
investments in order to pay the applicable tax. 
Accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to our
stockholders would be reduced for each of the years involved.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical
and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial
results

,

and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.  There are only limited judicial or
administrative interpretations of these provisions.  Although we believe that we have operated,
commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1996, in a manner so
as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so
qualified.

In addition, although we are not aware of any pending tax legislation
that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a REIT, new legislation,
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the
tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT,
or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that
is adverse to our stockholders.

We may
change our business policies without stockholder approval

Our Board of Directors determines all of our material business
policies, with management’s input, including those related to our:

Our Board of Directors may amend or revise these policies at any time
without a vote of our stockholders. A change in these policies could adversely
affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

There are limits on the ownership of our capital stock under which a stockholder
may lose beneficial ownership of its shares

The Internal Revenue Code provides that, in order for us to maintain
our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50% of the value of our outstanding
capital stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer
individuals or entities.

In addition, our charter prohibits, with certain limited exceptions,
direct or constructive ownership of shares of our capital stock representing
more than 9.8% of the combined total value of the outstanding shares of our
capital


stock by any
person (the “Ownership Limit”).  Our
Board of Directors may exempt a stockholder from the Ownership Limit if, prior
to the exemption, our Board of Directors receives all information it deems
necessary to determine or ensure our status as a REIT.

The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares
of our common stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related
individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or
entity.  A transfer of shares to a person
who, as a result of the transfer, violates the Ownership Limit, may be void or
may be deemed to be made to a trust, for the benefit of one or more qualified
charitable organizations designated by us. 
In that case, the intended transferee will have only a right to share,
to the extent of the transferee’s original purchase price for such shares, in
proceeds from the trust’s sale of those shares.

In
addition to the ownership limit, certain provisions of our charter and bylaws
and our stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent transactions that may be
deemed to be desirable to our stockholders

As authorized by Maryland law, our charter allows our Board of
Directors to cause us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our
common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares
of common or preferred stock without any stockholder approval.  Our Board of Directors could establish a
series of preferred stock that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction that
might involve a premium price for our common stock or for other reasons be
desired by our common stockholders or that have a dividend preference which may
adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.

Our charter permits the removal of a director only upon a two-thirds
vote of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors
and our bylaws require advance notice of a stockholder’s intention to nominate
directors or to present business for consideration by stockholders at an annual
meeting of our stockholders.  Our charter
and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a
transaction or change in control that involves a premium price for our common
stock or that for other reasons may be desired by our stockholders.

Under our Stockholder Rights Plan, if a stockholder acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, other stockholders would become entitled
to purchase our common stock at half the market price, which would likely
result in substantial dilution to the 15% or greater stockholder.  This may also have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium
price for our common stock or for other reasons desired by our common
stockholders.

External
factors may adversely impact the valuation of investments

We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and
privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry.  The valuation of these investments is
affected by many external factors beyond our control, including, but not
limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable or
unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new
collaborative agreements.  Unfavorable
developments with respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on
the valuation of our investments.

We have certain ownership interests outside the
United States, and we expect to continue to pursue international expansion
opportunities that may subject us to different or greater risks than those
associated with our domestic operations

We have four operating properties and one development parcel in Canada
and a development project in China. We are pursuing, and intend to continue to
pursue, additional growth opportunities in Canada, Europe and Asia.  International development and ownership
activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to
our domestic properties and operations. 
These risks include but are not limited to:


·

changes in applicable
  laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign operations.

Although our international activities currently represent a relatively
small portion of our overall business, these risks could increase in
significance which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on our results of
operations and financial condition.

We are
subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and foreign currencies

We are pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue, additional growth
opportunities in Canada, Europe and Asia. 
Investments in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the local currency
are subject to international currency risk from the potential fluctuations in
exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currency.  A significant decrease in the value of the
Canadian dollar, or other foreign currencies where we may have a significant
investment could materially affect our results of operations.  We may attempt to mitigate such effects by
borrowing in the local foreign currency in which we invest.  Any international currency gain recognized
with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross
income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order
to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT.

We are subject to risks and liabilities in
connection with properties owned through joint ventures, limited liability
companies and partnerships

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds
that we may invest in non-wholly owned partnerships, limited liability
companies or joint ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire
properties through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships
with third parties. Such third parties may share certain approval rights over
major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture
investments involve certain risks, including:

We generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships,
limited liability companies and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our
business objectives. However, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence
of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

General

As of December 31, 2007, we had 166 properties containing
approximately 12.1 million rentable square feet of office/laboratory
space.  Excluding properties undergoing
redevelopment, our properties were approximately 93.8% leased as of December 31,
2007.  The exteriors of our properties
typically resemble traditional office properties, but the interior
infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science industry
tenants. These improvements typically are generic to life science industry
tenants rather than being specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we
believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility and are usable
by a wide range of life science industry tenants. Generic infrastructure
improvements to our life science properties typically include:

As of December 31,
2007, we held a fee simple interest in each of our properties, except for
twenty-three properties that accounted for approximately 20% of the total
rentable square footage of our properties. We had four properties in the San
Francisco Bay market, in which we held pursuant to a commercial condominium
interest, together with an undivided interest in the common areas of the
project of which the property is a part. We also had three properties in the
San Francisco Bay market, one property in the Southeast market, two properties
in the Suburban Washington D.C. market and 13 properties in the Eastern
Massachusetts market which we held pursuant to ground leasehold interests. See
further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
in “Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.”

In addition, as of December 31, 2007, our asset base contained two
ground-up development projects for approximately 887,000 rentable square feet
in the New York City and San Francisco Bay markets which we held pursuant to
ground leasehold interests and one ground-up development in China for
approximately 280,000 rentable square feet which we held pursuant to a land
usage right. We also had two land parcels for future ground up development of
approximately 1.1 million developable square feet which we held pursuant to
ground leasehold interests.

As of December 31, 2007, we had 391 leases with a total of 323
tenants, and 90 of our 166 properties were single-tenant properties.  Leases in our multi-tenant buildings
typically have terms of three to seven years, while the single-tenant building
leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. As of December 31,
2007:

·

approximately 88% of
  our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases,
  requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance,
  utilities, common area and other operating expenses (including increases
  thereto) in addition to base rent, and, in addition to our triple net leases,
  approximately 9% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required
  the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses;

·

approximately 94% of
  our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual
  rent escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or
  indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and

·

approximately 91% of
  our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the recapture of
  certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or
  replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing), which we believe would
  typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.


Our leases also typically give us the right to review
and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed
improvements to the properties remain our property after termination of the
lease at our election. However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our
leases to require that the tenant, at its expense, remove the improvements and
restore the premises to their original condition.

The locations of our
properties are diversified among a number of life science markets.  The following table sets forth, as of December 31,
2007, the total rentable square footage, annualized base rent and encumbrances
of our properties in each of our existing markets (dollars in thousands).

Location of
properties

(1)

Annualized base rent
  means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of
  December 31, 2007 (using rental revenue computed on a straight-line
  basis in accordance with GAAP). Amounts exclude spaces at properties totaling
  approximately 774,519 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in
  use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment and two properties
  totaling approximately 136,399 rentable square feet that are classified as
  “held for sale.”

(2)

Certain properties are
  pledged as security under our secured notes payable as of December 31,
  2007. See Schedule III — Consolidated Financial Statement Schedule of Rental
  Properties and Accumulated Depreciation in “Item 15. Exhibits, Financial
  Statement Schedules” for additional information on our properties, including
  encumbered properties. Excludes approximately $150.7 million of encumbrances
  related to properties undergoing development and redevelopment and land held
  for development.

In addition, as of
December 31, 2007, our asset base contained land parcels approximating 1.6
million rentable square feet undergoing ground-up development and an imbedded
pipeline for future ground-up development opportunities for approximating 8.7
million developable square feet of office/laboratory space.


Tenants

Our life science
properties are leased principally to a diverse group of tenants, with no tenant
being responsible for more than 6.9% of our annualized base rent.  The following table sets forth information
regarding leases with our 10 largest tenants based upon annualized base rent as
of December 31, 2007.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

To our knowledge, no litigation is pending against us, other than
routine actions and administrative proceedings, substantially all of which are
expected to be covered by liability insurance and which, in the aggregate, are
not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION
OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

We did not submit any matters to a vote of our
security holders in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31,
2007.


PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR
REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
under the symbol “ARE”. On February 26, 2008, the last reported sales
price per share of our common stock was $96.11, and there were approximately 263
holders of record of our common stock (excluding beneficial owners whose shares
are held in the name of CEDE & Co.). The following table sets forth
the quarterly high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as
reported on the NYSE and the distributions paid by us with respect to each such
period.

Future distributions on our common stock will be
determined by and at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be
dependent upon a number of factors, including actual cash available for
distribution, our financial condition and capital requirements, the annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. To
maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to
stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income for the current taxable
year, determined without regard to deductions for dividends paid and excluding
any net capital gains. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make
distributions in excess of cash flow available for distributions to meet these
distribution requirements. In such a case, we may borrow funds or may raise
funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity capital. We cannot
assure you that we will make any future distributions.

The tax treatment of distributions paid in 2007 is as
follows: (1) 83.6% ordinary dividend, (2) 10.0% capital gain at 15%, (3) 5.1%
return of capital, and (4) 1.3% Section 1250 capital gain at
25%.  The tax treatment of distributions
on common stock paid in 2006 is as follows: 
(1) 82.1% ordinary dividend, (2) 12.3% capital gain at 15%, (3) 3.3%
return of capital, and (4) 2.3% Section 1250 capital gain at 25%.

See “Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters” for information on
securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans.


ITEM 6. SELECTED
FINANCIAL DATA

The following table should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 
See “Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules”.


(1)

During the first quarter of
2007, we redeemed our 9.10% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock
(“Series B Preferred Stock”).  In
accordance with EITF Topic D-42, we recorded a charge of approximately
$2,799,000 to net income available to common stockholders for costs related to
the redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock. During the second quarter
of 2004, we elected to redeem our 9.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”).  Accordingly, in compliance with Emerging Issues
Task Force Topic D-42, we recorded a charge of $1,876,000, in the second
quarter of 2004 for costs related to the redemption of the Series A
Preferred Stock.

(2)

Includes depreciation and
amortization on assets “held for sale” reflected as discontinued operations
(for the periods prior to when such assets were designated as “held for sale”).

(3)

Gain/loss on sales of
property relates to the disposition of four properties and four land parcels
sold during 2007, three properties sold during 2006, one property sold during
2005, one property sold during 2004, and three properties sold during
2003.  Gain/loss on sales of property is
included in the consolidated statements of income in income from discontinued
operations, net.

(4)

GAAP basis accounting for
real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate
values diminish over time.  In an effort
to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost
accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) established the
measurement tool of Funds From Operations (“FFO”).  Since its introduction, FFO has become a
widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs.  We believe that FFO is helpful to investors
as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards
established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White
Paper (the “White Paper”) and related implementation guidance, which may differ
from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO is a relevant and widely used
measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an
alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication
of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it
indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to
make distributions.  For a more detailed
discussion of FFO, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Funds From Operations”.


ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATION

The terms “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” as used in this Form 10-K
refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes in “Item 15.
Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules”. Forward-looking statements involve
inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions and financial
trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy,
results of operations and financial position. 
A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ
materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking
statements, including, but not limited to, those described below in this report
and under the headings “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. 
We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or
to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements
contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

Overview

We are a publicly-traded real estate investment trust focused principally
on the ownership, operation, management, selective development, redevelopment
and acquisition of life science properties. 
Our properties are designed and improved for lease primarily to
institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit institutions),
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, life science product, service,
and translational medicine entities, as well as governmental agencies.

In 2007, we:

·

Completed ground-up development of one
property aggregating approximately 157,340 rentable square feet.

·

Commenced ground-up development of four
properties aggregating approximately 553,000 rentable square feet.

·

Completed redevelopment of multiple spaces
at ten properties aggregating approximately 258,411 rentable square feet.

·

Sold four real estate assets and four
land parcels for approximately $73 million.

·

Closed follow-on common offering with net
proceeds of approximately $215.2 million.

·

Redeemed 9.10% Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock and incurred redemption charge of approximately $2.8
million.

·

Closed $460 million of 3.70% convertible
notes.

·

Closed $200 million secured loan and $62
million pre-construction secured loan.

·

Increased credit facility to $1.9 billion
plus a $500 million accordion.

·

Acquired four land parcels aggregating
approximately 541,592 developable square feet.

·

Acquired sixteen properties aggregating
approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet.

As of December 31, 2007, we had 166 properties containing
approximately 12.1 million rentable square feet of office/laboratory
space.  As of that date, our properties
were approximately 93.8% leased, excluding spaces at properties undergoing
redevelopment.  In addition, as of December 31,
2007, our asset base contained properties undergoing ground-up development
approximating 1.6 million rentable square feet plus an imbedded pipeline for
future ground-up development approximating 8.7 million developable square feet.

Our primary sources of revenue are rental income and tenant recoveries
from leases of our properties.  The
comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing
of our property development, redevelopment and acquisition activities.  Of the 166 properties as of December 31,
2007, 16 were acquired in 2007, 19 in 2006, 18 in 2005, and 94 prior to
2005.  In addition, we completed the
development of one property in 2007 (together with the 16 properties acquired
in 2007, the “2007 Properties”), four properties in 2006 (together with the 19
properties acquired in 2006, the “2006 Properties”), three properties in 2005
(together with the 18 properties acquired in 2005, the “2005 Properties”), and
11 properties prior to 2005.  As a result
of these development and


acquisition
activities, as well as our ongoing redevelopment and leasing activities, there
have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses, including significant
increases in total revenues and expenses for 2007 as compared to 2006, and for
2006 as compared to 2005.

As of December 31, 2007, approximately 88% of our leases (on a
rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and
other operating expenses, including increases thereto.  In addition, as of December 31, 2007,
approximately 9% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required
the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2007,
approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided
for the recapture of certain capital expenditures and approximately 94% of our
leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent
escalations that are either fixed or indexed based on the consumer price index
or another index.

Critical
accounting policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”).  Our significant
accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial
statements in “Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.”  The preparation of these financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses.  We base these estimates,
judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

REIT
compliance

We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
under the Internal Revenue Code. 
Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and
complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial
results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not
entirely within our control.  We believe
that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to
qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. 
However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in
a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future
operations could cause us to fail to qualify.

If we fail to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal
income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable
income at regular corporate rates.  If we
lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or
distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the
years involved and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our
stockholders.

Rental
properties, net and properties undergoing development and redevelopment and
land held for development

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
“Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”), we allocate the purchase price of acquired
properties to land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant
improvements, equipment, and identified intangibles (including intangible value
to above or below market leases and origination costs associated with acquired
in-place leases, tenant relationships and other intangible assets) based upon
their relative fair values.  The value of
tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an “as if
vacant” basis.  We assess the fair value
of tangible and intangible assets based on estimated cash flow projections that
utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market
information.  Estimates of future cash
flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating
results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the
property.

The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building
improvements, tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a
straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements,
40 years for buildings and building improvements, the respective lease term for
tenant improvements and the estimated useful life for equipment.  The values of above and below market leases
are amortized over the lives of the related leases and recorded as either an
increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to
rental income.  The values of origination
costs associated with acquired in-place leases are classified as leasing costs,
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.


Rental properties, properties undergoing development and redevelopment
and land held for development and intangibles are individually evaluated for
impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
“Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”) when
conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of
expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount.  Upon determination that an impairment has
occurred, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to its
estimated fair value.

Capitalization
of costs

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost” (“SFAS 34”) and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67, “Accounting for Costs
and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects” (“SFAS 67”), we
capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment
costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and
essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment or construction of a
project.  Pursuant to SFAS 34 and SFAS
67, capitalization of construction, development and redevelopment costs is
required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use.  Costs incurred after a project is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as
incurred.  Costs previously capitalized
related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are written
off.  Should development, redevelopment
or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance and certain
costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as
incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred.

We also capitalize
costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities.  These costs are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the related leases. 
Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed.

Accounting
for investments

We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded
companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science
industry.  All of our investments in
publicly-traded companies are considered “available for sale” in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), and are
recorded at fair value.  Fair value has
been determined based upon the closing trading price as of the balance sheet
date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity.  The classification
of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each investment is
made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date.  The cost of investments sold is determined by
the specific identification method, with net realized gains included in other
income.

Investments in privately held entities are generally
accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating
or financial policies of the entities in which we invest.  Certain investments are accounted for under
the equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,
“The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock” and Emerging
Issues Task Force Topic D-46, “Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments”.
Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment initially at
cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of
the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our
investment.

Individual investments are evaluated for impairment
when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that an impairment
exists. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but
are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable
or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new
collaborative agreements. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair
value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than
temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a
non-cash charge to current earnings.

Interest
rate swap agreements

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our
exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan. 
These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the “notional
amount”).  Interest received under all of
our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid
and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.


We reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheets at
their estimated fair values with an offsetting adjustment reflected as
unrealized gains/losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
equity.  We use a variety of methods and
assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet
date to determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements.  These methods of assessing fair value result
in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be realized.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”), as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities” establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such as
our interest rate swap agreements.  All
of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly
effective” under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest
rates.  In accordance with SFAS 133, we
formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and
hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk
strategy.  Accordingly, we have
categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  We make an assessment at the inception of each
interest rate swap agreement and on an on going basis to determine whether these
instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated
with the hedged items.  The ineffective
portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately recognized in
earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge
accounting, if hedges did not qualify as “highly effective”, the changes in the
fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.

We do not believe we are exposed to a significant amount of credit risk
in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions.

Recognition
of rental income and tenant recoveries

Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent,
incentives and other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the respective lease terms.  We
include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in
later years, in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.  Amounts received currently, but
recognized as income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in our consolidated
balance sheets.  We commence recognition
of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the
tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property.

Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes,
insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are
recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.

We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the
inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the
lease.  If a tenant fails to make
contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt
expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and unrealized
deferred rent.  As of December 31,
2007 and 2006, we had no allowance for doubtful accounts.

Discontinued
operations

We follow the provisions of SFAS 144 in determining whether a property
qualifies as an asset “held for sale” and should be classified as “discontinued
operations”.  A property is classified as
“held for sale” when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been
met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits
to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is available for
immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to the terms that are
usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other
actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the
sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one
year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that
is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions
necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that
significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be
withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified
as “held for sale”, its operations are classified as discontinued operations in
our consolidated statements of income and amounts for all prior periods presented
are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations.  A loss is recognized for any initial
adjustment of the asset’s carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in
the period the asset qualifies as “held for sale.”

Depreciation
of assets ceases upon designation of a property as “held for sale.”  Interest expense directly attributable to
assets “held for sale” is classified in discontinued operations.


Impact of
recently issued accounting standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (R), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS
141R”), to create greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting
of business combinations. SFAS 141R requires a company to recognize the assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquired entity to be measured at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
SFAS 141R also requires companies to recognize the fair value of assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in
acquisitions of less than a one hundred percent interest when the acquisition
constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.  In addition, SFAS 141R requires that
acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from
the business combination and expensed as incurred. SFAS 141R is effective for
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15,
2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of
SFAS 141R on our financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
‘‘Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment
of ARB No. 51’’ (‘‘SFAS 160’’). SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 “Consolidated
Financial Statements,” and requires all entities to report noncontrolling
interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial
statements, but separate from the parent shareholders’ equity.  SFAS No. 160 also requires any
acquisitions or dispositions of noncontrolling interests that do not result in
a change of control to be accounted for as equity transactions.  In addition, SFAS No. 160 requires that
a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated upon a change in control. 
SFAS No. 160 applies to fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008 and is adopted prospectively. The presentation and disclosure requirements
shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Earlier adoption is
prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 160 will result in a reclassification of
minority interest to a separate component of total equity and net income
attributable to noncontrolling interest will no longer be treated as a
reduction to net income but will be shown as a reduction from net income in
calculating net income available to common stockholders.  The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to
have an impact on net income available to common stockholders or earnings per
share attributable to common stockholders.

In August 2007, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) released for public comment a proposed FASB Staff
Position (“FSP”) that would affect the accounting treatment for convertible
debt instruments, such as our outstanding unsecured convertible notes, that may
be settled wholly or partially in cash. The proposed FSP would require that
instruments within its scope be separated into their liability and equity
components at initial recognition by recording the liability component at the
fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity
component and attributing the remaining proceeds from issuance to the equity
component. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over
its initial fair value would be amortized to interest expense using the
interest method.  In addition, the
proposed FSP requires that interest cost for our unsecured convertible notes be
accounted for based on our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The FASB is
expected to begin its redeliberations of the guidance in the proposed FSP in
early 2008. The proposed FSP may be effective for reporting periods as early as
2008 and is expected to be applied retrospectively to prior periods.  If the FSP is issued as proposed, we expect
an increase in our non-cash interest expense associated with our $460 million
aggregate principal amount outstanding of convertible notes that were issued in
January 2007, including non-cash interest expense for prior periods as a
result of its proposed retrospective application. We believe the additional
non-cash interest expense we may recognize under the proposed FSP would result
in an increase to interest expense as our estimated nonconvertible debt
borrowing rate is higher than the current contractual coupon rate of 3.70% on
our $460 million unsecured convertible notes. 
For example, under the proposed FSP, if the interest rate for our
nonconvertible borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% higher than the current
contractual coupon rate of 3.70% on our unsecured convertible notes, our
non-cash interest expense included in net income for the year ended December 31,
2007 would increase by approximately 8% to 9%. The proposed FSP, if adopted as
proposed, will also increase our non-cash interest in future periods during
which our unsecured convertible notes remain outstanding. We are currently
evaluating our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate and the overall impact of the
proposed FSP on our consolidated financial statements. The impact of the
proposed FSP on our consolidated financial statements could be influenced by
certain factors, including the ultimate outcome of the final rules under
the proposed FSP.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities —
Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS 159”).
SFAS 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that
are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and
losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been
elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is
effective January 1, 2008.   We do
not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on our financial
statements.


In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS
157”), which provides a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the
definition of fair value within the framework and expands disclosures about the
use of fair value measurements.  SFAS 157
applies to all existing pronouncements under GAAP that require or permit the
use of fair value measurements, except for SFAS 123R.  SFAS 157 is effective for fair value
measurements beginning in our first quarter of 2008.  We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to
have a material impact on our financial statements.

In December 2005, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets”
(“SFAS 153”), which amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29, “Accounting
for Nonmonetary Transactions” (“APB 29”). 
SFAS 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets
and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the
fair values of the assets exchanged. 
SFAS 153 was effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in our
third quarter of 2005.  The adoption of
SFAS 153 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In May 2005,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, “Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS 154”), which replaces Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statements”.  SFAS 154
requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of
voluntary changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to
determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the
change.  SFAS 154 was effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors beginning in 2006.  The adoption of SFAS 154 did not have an
impact on our financial statements.


Results of
operations

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31,

Rental revenues increased by $69.9 million, or 29%, to $306.7 million
for 2007 compared to $236.8 million for 2006. 
The increase resulted primarily from the 2006 Properties being owned for
a full year and the addition of the 2007 Properties.

Tenant recoveries increased by $21.7 million, or 35%, to $83.8 million
for 2007 compared to $62.1 million for 2006. 
The increase resulted primarily from the 2006 Properties being owned for
a full year and the addition of the 2007 Properties.

Other income increased by $3.0 million, or 26%, to $14.9 million for
2007 compared to $11.8 million for 2006, due to an overall increase in all
sources of other income.  Other income
consists of construction management fees, interest, investment income and
storage.

Rental operating expenses increased by $29.4 million, or 42%, to $99.2
million for 2007 compared to $69.8 million for 2006.  The increase resulted primarily from increases
in rental operating expenses (primarily property taxes, insurance and
utilities) from properties developed, redeveloped and acquired in 2007 and
2006.  The majority of the increase in
rental operating expenses is recoverable from our tenants.

General and administrative expenses increased by $6.4 million, or 25%,
to $32.5 million for 2007 compared to $26.1 million for 2006, primarily due to
the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets,
from 158 properties with approximately 11.2 million rentable square feet as of December 31,
2006 to 166 properties containing approximately 12.1 million rentable square
feet as of December 31, 2007.  As a
percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for 2007 remained
relatively consistent with 2006.

Interest expense increased by $17.0 million, or 24%, to $88.4 million
for 2007 compared to $71.4 million for 2006. 
The increase resulted primarily from increases in indebtedness on our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, secured notes payable and
outstanding indebtedness related to our unsecured convertible notes. These
borrowings were utilized to finance the development, redevelopment and
acquisition of the 2006 and 2007 Properties. 
We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge a
portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with
our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see “Liquidity and
Capital Resources — Interest Rate Swaps”).

Depreciation and amortization increased by $24.0 million, or 33%, to
$96.5 million for 2007 compared to $72.4 million for 2006.  The increase resulted primarily from
depreciation associated with the 2006 Properties being owned for a full year
and the addition of the 2007 Properties.

Income from discontinued operations of $8.6 million for 2007 reflects
the results of operations of two properties that were designated as “held for
sale” as of December 31, 2007 and four properties and four land parcels
sold during 2007.  In connection with the
properties and land parcels sold in 2007, we recorded a gain of approximately
$8.0 million.  Income from discontinued
operations of $4.6 million for 2006 reflects the results of operations of two
properties designated as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2007, four
properties and four land parcels sold during 2007 and three properties sold in
2006.  In connection with the properties
sold in 2006, we recorded a gain of approximately $59,000.

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31,

Rental revenues increased by $56.7 million, or 32%, to $236.8 million
for 2006 compared to $180.1 million for 2005. 
The increase resulted primarily from the 2005 Properties being owned for
a full year and the addition of the 2006 Properties.

Tenant recoveries increased by $15.4 million, or 33%, to $62.1 million
for 2006 compared to $46.7 million for 2005. 
The increase resulted primarily from the 2005 Properties being owned for
a full year and the addition of the 2006 Properties.


Other income increased by $7.1 million, or 148%, to $11.8 million for
2006 compared to $4.8 million for 2005, due to an overall increase in all
sources of other income.  Other income consists
of construction management fees, interest, and investment income and storage.

Rental operating expenses increased by $18.4 million, or 36%, to $69.8
million for 2006 compared to $51.3 million for 2005.  The increase resulted primarily from increases
in rental operating expenses (primarily property taxes, insurance, and
utilities) from properties developed, redeveloped and acquired in 2006.  The majority of the increase in rental
operating expenses is recoverable from our tenants.

General and administrative expenses increased by $5.0 million or 24%,
to $26.1 million for 2006 compared to $21.1 million for 2005, primarily due to
the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets,
including internationally, from 132 properties with approximately 8.8 million
rentable square feet as of December 31, 2005 to 158 properties with
approximately 11.2 million rentable square feet as of December 31,
2006.  As a percentage of total revenues,
general and administrative expenses for 2006 remained relatively consistent
with 2005.

Interest expense increased by $22.3 million, or 45%, to $71.4 million
for 2006 compared to $49.1 million for 2005. 
The increase resulted primarily from increases in indebtedness on our
unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and secured notes payable, and
increases in the floating interest rates on our unsecured line of credit,
unsecured term loan and other floating rate debt.  These borrowings were utilized to finance the
development, redevelopment, and acquisition of the 2005 and 2006 Properties.
The weighted average interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan (not including the effect of interest rate swap agreements)
increased from 5.68% as of December 31, 2005 to 6.50% as of December 31,
2006.  We have entered into certain
interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable
interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Interest Rate Swap
Agreements”).

Depreciation and amortization increased by $19.5 million, or 37%, to
$72.4 million for 2006 compared to $52.9 million for 2005.  The increase resulted primarily from
depreciation associated with the 2005 Properties being owned for a full year
and the addition of the 2006 Properties.

Income from discontinued operations of $4.6 million
for 2006 reflects the results of operations of two properties that were
designated as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2007, four properties and
four land parcels sold during 2007 and three properties sold in 2006. In
connection with the property sold in 2006, we recorded a gain of approximately
$59,000. Income from discontinued operations of $6.9 million for 2005 reflects
the results of operations of two properties that were designated as “held for
sale” as of December 31, 2007, four properties and four land parcels sold
during 2007, three properties sold in 2006, and one property sold in 2005.  In connection with the sale of one property in
2005, we recorded a gain of approximately $36,000.


Liquidity and
capital resources

Cash flows

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 increased by $57.0
million to $185.4 million compared to $128.4 million for 2006.  The increase resulted primarily from an
increase in cash flows from operations and cash flows from overall changes in
operating assets and liabilities.

Net cash used in investing activities for 2007 was $947.0 million
compared to $970.6 million for 2006.  Net
cash used in investing activities was relatively consistent for 2007 and 2006
with a higher level of investments in properties undergoing development and
redevelopment and land held for development offset by a lower level of
additions to rental properties and a higher level of proceeds from the sales of
properties during 2007 as compared to 2006.

Net cash provided by financing activities for 2007 decreased by $74.5
million to $766.7 million compared to $841.2 million for 2006.  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease
in proceeds from issuance of common stock and secured notes payable coupled
with the redemption of Series B Preferred Stock, partially offset by an
increase in proceeds from the issuance of unsecured convertible notes.

Off-balance sheet arrangements

As of December 31, 2007, we
had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual obligations and commitments

Contractual obligations as of December 31,
2007 consisted of the following (in thousands):

Secured notes payable as of December 31,
2007 included 34 notes secured by 73 properties and 6 land development parcels.

Our unsecured line of credit
matures in October 2010 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional
one-year period. Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may
be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period.

In January 2007, we completed
a private offering of $460 million of 3.70% convertible unsecured notes.

Estimated interest payments on our
fixed rate debt and hedged variable rate debt were calculated based upon on
contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap
agreements; interest payment dates and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31,
2007, approximately 77% of our debt was fixed rate debt or variable rate debt
subject to interest rate swap agreements. See additional information regarding
our interest rate swap agreements under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Liquidity and Capital
Resources-Interest Rate Swap Agreements.” The remaining 23% of our debt is
unhedged variable rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our
unhedged variable rate debt have been excluded from the table above because the
Company cannot reasonably determine the future interest obligations on


its variable rate debt as the Company cannot predict
variable interest rates in the future. 
See additional information regarding our debt under Notes 5, 6, 7 and 8
to our consolidated financial statements.

Ground lease obligations as of December 31,
2007 included leases for 19 of our properties and three land development
parcels.  These lease obligations have
remaining lease terms of 25 to 99 years, exclusive of extension options.

In addition to the above, we were committed as of December 31,
2007 under the terms of contracts to complete the construction of properties
undergoing development and redevelopment and land held for development at a
remaining aggregate cost of approximately $361.4 million.

As of December 31, 2007, we were also committed to fund
approximately $18.3 million for the construction of building infrastructure
improvements under the terms of leases and/or construction contracts and
approximately $33.4 million for certain investments.

Tenant security deposits and other
restricted cash

Tenant security deposits and other restricted cash consisted of the
following (in thousands):

Secured notes payable

Secured notes payable totaled approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31,
2007 and 2006. Our secured notes payable had weighted average interest rates of
approximately 6.08% and 6.21% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
with maturity dates ranging from January 2008 to August 2016.

Our secured notes payable generally require monthly payments of
principal and interest.  The total book
values of rental properties, net and properties undergoing development and redevelopment
and land held for development securing debt were approximately $1.9 billion and
$1.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  At December 31, 2007, our secured notes
payable were comprised of approximately $902.9 million and $310.0 million of
fixed and variable rate debt, respectively, compared to approximately $940.0
million and $234.9 million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively, at December 31,
2006.

The following is a
summary of the scheduled principal payments for our secured notes payable and
the weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2007 (in
thousands):

(1)

The weighted average interest rate
related to payments on our secured debt is calculated based on the outstanding
debt as of December 31st of the year immediately preceding the year
presented.


Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan

In May 2007, we entered into an amendment to our amended and
restated credit agreement to increase the maximum permitted borrowings under
our unsecured credit facilities from $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion consisting of
an $1.15 billion unsecured line of credit and a $750 million unsecured term
loan. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under our unsecured
credit facilities by up to an additional $500 million.

Our unsecured line of credit, as amended, bears interest at a floating
rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the
bank’s reference rate and the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%. For each
LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six
months. Our unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010 and may be
extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period.  As of December 31, 2007, we had borrowings
of $365 million outstanding on our unsecured line of credit with a weighted
average interest rate of approximately 6.07%.

Our unsecured term loan bears interest at a floating rate based on our
election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank’s reference
rate and the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%. 
For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two,
three or six months.  Our unsecured term
loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our sole option for an
additional one-year period.  As of December 31,
2007, we had borrowings of $750 million outstanding on our unsecured term loan
with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact of our interest
rate swap agreements, of approximately 5.84%.

Our unsecured line of credit and our unsecured term loan contain
financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum net
worth, a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the
terms of the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict, among
other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers.

Aggregate unsecured borrowings may be limited to an amount based
primarily on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered
properties.  Aggregate unsecured
borrowings may increase as we complete the development, redevelopment or
acquisition of additional unencumbered properties. As of December 31,
2007, aggregate unsecured borrowings were limited to approximately $2.1
billion.

Unsecured convertible notes

In January 2007, we completed a private offering of $460 million
of convertible notes that are due in 2027 (the “Notes”) with a coupon of 3.70%.
The Notes have an initial conversion rate of approximately 8.4774 common shares
per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes. 
The initial conversion price of approximately $117.96 per share of our
common stock represented a premium of 20% based on the last reported sale price
of $98.30 per share of our common stock on January 10, 2007.  The net proceeds from this offering, after
underwriters’ discount, were approximately $450.8 million.

Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes into cash and, if
applicable, shares of our common stock prior to stated maturity only under the
following circumstances:  (1) the
Notes will be convertible during any calendar quarter after the calendar
quarter ending March 31, 2007, if the closing sale price of our common
stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading
days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar
quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day
of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) the Notes will be
convertible during the five consecutive business days immediately after any
five consecutive trading day period (the “Note Measurement Period”) in which
the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was equal to or
less than 98% of the average conversion value of the Notes during the Note
Measurement Period; (3) the Notes will be convertible upon the occurrence
of specified corporate transactions, including a change in control, certain
merger or consolidation transactions or the liquidation of the Company; (4) the
Notes will be convertible if we call the Notes for redemption; and (5) the
Notes will be convertible at any time from, and including, December 15,
2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15,
2027 or earlier redemption or repurchase. As of December 31, 2007, the
Notes had a conversion rate of approximately 8.4842 common shares per $1,000
principal amount of the Notes and a conversion price of approximately $117.87
per share of our common stock.

Prior to January 15, 2012, we will not have the right to redeem
the Notes, except to preserve our qualification as a real estate investment
trust.  On and after that date, we have
the right to redeem the Notes, in


whole or in part,
at any time and from time to time, for cash equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

Holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes, in whole
or in part, on January 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022 for cash equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid
interest to but excluding the repurchase date.

Interest rate swap agreements

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our
exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan. 
These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the “notional
amount”).  Interest received under all of
our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid
and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.

The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31,
2007 (dollars in thousands):


We do not believe we are exposed to a significant amount of credit risk
in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions. 
In addition, we have entered into master derivative agreements with each
counterparty.  These master derivative
agreements (all of which are on the standard International Swaps &
Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between us and
each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our
swap agreements, including a default by a counterparty.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our interest rate swap
agreements were classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, tenant
security deposits and other assets at their fair values aggregating a liability
balance of approximately $26.9 million and an asset balance of approximately
$1.0 million, respectively, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as
unrealized losses and gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity.  Balances in
accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap payments
are made.  During the next twelve months,
we expect to reclassify approximately $6.8 million from accumulated other
comprehensive income to interest expense as an increase to interest expense.

Other resources and liquidity requirements

In September 2007, we sold 2,300,000 shares of our common stock in
a follow-on offering (including the shares issued upon exercise of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option). 
The shares were issued at a price of $96.00 per share, resulting in
aggregate proceeds of approximately $215 million (after deducting underwriting
discounts and other offering costs).

In February 2007, we called for redemption of our 9.10% Series B
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”).  The Series B Preferred Stock was
redeemed in March 2007 at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share
plus $0.4107639 per share representing accumulated and unpaid dividends to the
redemption date.  In accordance with EITF
Topic D-42, we recorded a charge of approximately $2,799,000 to net income
available to common stockholders for costs related to the redemption of the Series B
Preferred Stock.

Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, we may offer common stock, preferred stock,
debt and other securities.  These
securities may be issued from time to time and at our discretion based on our
needs and market conditions.

We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital
requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by
operating activities.  We believe that
the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to
enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a
REIT.  We also believe that net cash
provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund recurring
non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing
commissions.

We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as for
property development and redevelopment activities, property acquisitions,
scheduled debt maturities, expansions and other non-recurring capital
improvements, through net cash provided by operating activities, long-term
secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under the unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan, and the issuance of additional debt
and/or equity securities.

Exposure to environmental liabilities

In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have
obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any
environmental liabilities or other issues. 
The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not
revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a
whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have
occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed.  In addition, we carry a policy of pollution
legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at
all of our properties.


Capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing
costs

The following table shows total and weighted average per square foot
property-related capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs
(all of which are added to the basis of the properties) related to our life
science properties (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that
are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing or related to properties that
have undergone redevelopment) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006,
2005, 2004 and 2003:

(1)

Property-related
capital expenditures include all major capital and recurring capital
expenditures except capital expenditures that are recoverable from tenants,
revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, or costs related to the redevelopment
of a property.  Major capital
expenditures consist of roof replacements and HVAC systems that are typically
identified and considered at the time a property is acquired.  Major capital expenditures for 2003 also
included one-time costs related to the implementation of our national branding
and signage program.  Recurring capital
expenditures exclude major capital expenditures.

(2)

Major
capital expenditures for 2004 included a one-time HVAC system upgrade at one
property totaling $1,551,000 or $0.25 per square foot.

(3)

Major capital
expenditures for 2003 included $1,072,000 or $0.19 per square foot in one-time
costs related to the implementation of our national branding and signage
program.

(4)

Excludes
space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting.

Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature,
extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are
recoverable from our tenants. Approximately 91% of our leases provide for the
recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance
and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing).  In addition, we maintain an active
preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital
expenditures.

Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year
depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property
age, location and characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or
retenanted space), the involvement of external leasing agents and overall
competitive market conditions.


Inflation

As of December 31, 2007, approximately 88% of our leases (on a
rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and
other operating expenses, including increases thereto.  In addition, as of December 31, 2007,
approximately 9% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required
the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. Approximately 94% of our
leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent
escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or
indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do
not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are
subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation,
however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate
borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan.

Funds from
operations

GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost
accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time.  In an effort to overcome the difference
between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate
assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) established the measurement tool of Funds From
Operations (“FFO”).  Since its
introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by
REITs.  We believe that FFO is helpful to
investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards
established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White
Paper (the “White Paper”) and related implementation guidance, which may differ
from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO is a relevant and widely used
measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an
alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication
of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it
indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to
make distributions (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows” above
for information regarding these measures of cash flow).

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available
to common stockholders to funds from operations available to common
stockholders (in thousands):

(1)

Includes depreciation and
  amortization on assets “held for sale” reflected as discontinued operations
  (for the periods prior to when such assets were designated as “held for
  sale”).

(2)

Gain on sales of property relates
  to the disposition of four properties and four land parcels during 2007 and
  three properties during 2006. Gain on sales of property is included in the
  consolidated statements of income in income from discontinued operations, net.


Property and lease
information

The following table is a summary of our properties as of December 31,
2007 (dollars in thousands):

The following table summarizes information with respect to the lease
expirations at our properties as of December 31, 2007:

Includes
  16 month-to-month leases for approximately 85,000 square feet.

ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the exposure to losses resulting from changes in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity
prices.  The primary market risk to which
we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from many
factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and
international economic and political considerations and other factors that are
beyond our control.

In order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our
outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate risks on our
operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including
interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate exchange
contracts.  The use of these types of
instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates
carries additional risks, such as counter-party credit risk and the legal
enforceability of hedging contracts.


Our future earnings and fair values relating to financial instruments
are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, such as LIBOR.
However, our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce the effects
of interest rate changes.  Based on
interest rates at, and our interest rate swap agreements in effect on, December 31,
2007 and 2006, we estimate that a 1% increase in interest rates on our variable
rate debt, including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan,
after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements, would
decrease annual future earnings by approximately $4.0 million and $1.5 million,
respectively.  We further estimate that a
1% decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt, including our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, after considering the effect
of our interest rate swap agreements in effect on December 31, 2007 and
2006, would increase annual future earnings by approximately $4.0 million and
$1.5 million, respectively.  A 1%
increase in interest rates on our secured debt, unsecured convertible notes and
interest rate swap agreements would decrease their aggregate fair values by
approximately $71.3 million and $68.8 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.  A 1% decrease in
interest rates on our secured debt, unsecured convertible notes and interest
rate swap agreements would increase their aggregate fair values by
approximately $74.9 million and $71.7 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact
of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate
swap agreements in effect on December 31, 2007 and 2006.  These analyses do not consider the effects of
the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment.  Further, in the event of a
change of such magnitude, we would consider taking actions to further mitigate
our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific
actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity
analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure.

We have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity
investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held
entities.  We classify investments in
publicly-traded companies as available-for-sale and, consequently, record them
on our balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.  Investments in privately held entities are
generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any
of the operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest.  For all investments, we recognize other than
temporary declines in value against earnings in the same period the decline in
value was deemed to have occurred.  There
is no assurance that future declines in values will not have a material adverse
impact on our future results of operations. 
By way of example, a 10% decrease in the fair value of our equity
investments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 would decrease their fair
values by approximately $8.4 million and $7.5 million, respectively.

We have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate market risk related
to our subsidiaries operating in Canada. 
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries operating in Canada
is the local currency.  Gains or losses
resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets and
income statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. 
Gains or losses will be reflected in our income statement when there is
a sale or partial sale of our investment in these operations or upon a complete
or substantially complete liquidation of the investment. Based on our current
operating assets outside the United States as of December 31,
2007, we estimate that a 10% increase in foreign currency rates
relative to the U.S. dollar would increase annual future earnings by
approximately $694,000.  We further estimate that a 10% decrease in
foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar would decrease annual
future earnings by approximately $694,000.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting

There have been no significant changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31,
2007 that could materially affect, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures

As of December 31, 2007, we performed an evaluation, under the
supervision of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer
(“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These
controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that information required
for disclosure is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
requisite time periods.  Based on our
evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2007.


Management’s
annual report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its
subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with the authorizations of the Company’s management and directors;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.  Management has assessed the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2007.  In making its assessment,
management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control —
Integrated Framework”.  Management
concluded that based on its assessment, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.  The effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders of

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

We have audited
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”)
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO
criteria”). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based
on the COSO criteria.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, and our
report dated February 26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders of

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
and subsidiaries’(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007.  Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Alexandria Real Estate
Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated February 26, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1.
Background

References to the
“Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
and its subsidiaries.

Alexandria Real
Estate Equities, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in
1994.  We are engaged principally in the
ownership, operation, management, selective development, redevelopment and
acquisition of life science properties. 
Our properties are designed and improved for lease primarily to
institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit institutions),
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, life science product, service,
and translational medicine entities, as well as governmental agencies. As of December 31,
2007, we had 166 properties (162 properties located in ten states in the United
States and four properties located in Canada) containing approximately 12.1
million rentable square feet of office/laboratory space, compared to 158
properties (155 properties located in ten states in the United States and three
properties located in Canada) with approximately 11.2 million rentable square
feet of office/laboratory space as of December 31, 2006.

As of December 31,
2007, approximately 88% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were
triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes,
insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses, including
increases thereto.  In addition, as of December 31,
2007, approximately 9% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis)
required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2007,
approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided
for the recapture of certain capital expenditures and approximately 94% of our
leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent
escalations that are either fixed or indexed based on the consumer price index
or another index.  Any references to the
number of buildings, square footage and occupancy in the notes to consolidated
financial statement are unaudited.

2. Basis
of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alexandria Real
Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

We hold interests,
together with certain third parties, in a limited partnership and in limited
liability companies which we consolidate in our financial statements. Such
interests are subject to provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN46R”), FASB Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 96-16, “Investor’s Accounting for an Investee When
the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder
or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights”, FASB Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 04-5, “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the
General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity
When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” and AICPA Statement of Position
78-9, “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures”.  Based on the provisions set forth in these
rules, we consolidate the limited partnership and limited liability companies
because we exercise significant control over major decisions by these entities,
such as investment activity and changes in financing.  For entities that are variable interest
entities, as defined under FIN 46R, we consolidate the entity if we are the
primary beneficiary.

Use of estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Fair value of financial instruments

The carrying
amounts of cash and cash equivalents, tenant security deposits and other
restricted cash, tenant receivables, unsecured line of credit and unsecured
term loan, and accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits
approximate fair value. As described in Note 8, our interest rate swap
agreements have been recorded at fair value.

The fair value of
our secured notes payable and unsecured convertible notes was estimated using
available market information and discounted cash flows analyses based on
borrowing rates we believe we could obtain with similar terms and
maturities.  As of December 31, 2007
and 2006, the aggregate fair values of our secured notes payable and unsecured
convertible notes were approximately $1,668,549,000 and $1,179,404,000,
respectively.

Operating
segment

We are engaged in
the business of providing office/laboratory space for lease to the life science
industry. Our properties are similar in nature of providing space for lease to
the life science industry, consists of office/laboratory improvements that are
generic and reusable in nature for the life science industry, are located in
key life science cluster markets and have similar economic characteristics. Our
chief operating decision maker, as defined under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information”, reviews financial information for our entire
consolidated operations when making decisions on how to allocate resources and
in assessment of our operating performance. 
The financial information disclosed herein represents all of the
financial information related to our principal operating segment.

International
operations

The functional
currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States is the U.S.
dollar.  We have four operating
properties and one development parcel in Canada and a development project in
China.  The functional currency for our
foreign subsidiaries operating in Canada and China is the local currency.  The assets and liabilities of our foreign
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as
of the financial statement date.  Income
statement accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the average
exchange rate for the period presented. 
Gains or losses resulting from the translation are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’
equity.

The appropriate
amounts of exchange gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive
income will be reflected in income when there is a sale or partial sale of our
investment in these operations or upon a complete or substantially complete
liquidation of the investment.

Rental properties, net and properties undergoing
development and redevelopment and land held for development

In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141”), we allocate the purchase price of acquired
properties to land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant
improvements, equipment, and identified intangibles (including intangible value
to above or below market leases and origination costs associated with acquired
in-place leases, tenant relationships and other intangible assets) based upon
their relative fair values.  The value of
tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an “as if
vacant” basis.  We assess fair value of
tangible and intangible assets based on estimated cash flow projections that
utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market
information.  Estimates of future cash
flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating
results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.

The values
allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant
improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an
estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and
building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and
the estimated useful life for equipment. 
The values of origination costs associated with acquired in-place leases
are classified as leasing costs, included in other assets in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining terms of the
related leases.

2. Basis
of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Rental properties, net and properties undergoing
development and redevelopment and land held for development (continued)

In accordance with
SFAS 141, the values of above and below market leases are amortized over the
terms of the related leases and recorded as either an increase (for below
market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income.  For the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006, and 2005, we recognized a net increase in rental income of approximately
$7,572,000, $8,497,000 and $6,379,000, respectively, for the amortization of
acquired above and below market leases. The value of acquired leases, less
accumulated amortization, was approximately $46,703,000 as of December 31,
2007.  The weighted average amortization
period of acquired leases was approximately 4.6 years as of December 31,
2007.  The estimated aggregate annual
amortization of acquired leases for each of the five succeeding years is
approximately $7,258,000 for 2008, $7,167,000 for 2009, $6,809,000 for 2010,
$5,216,000 for 2011 and $3,631,000 for 2012.

Rental properties,
properties undergoing development and redevelopment and land held for
development and intangibles are individually evaluated for impairment in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”),
when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of
expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount.  Upon determination that an impairment has
occurred, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to its
estimated fair value.

In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, “Capitalization of
Interest Cost” (“SFAS 34”) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67,
“Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects”
(“SFAS 67”), we capitalize direct construction and development costs, including
predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs
directly related and essential to the acquisition, development or construction
of a project.  Pursuant to SFAS 34 and
SFAS 67, capitalization of construction, development and redevelopment costs is
required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use.
Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its
intended use are expensed as incurred. 
Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or
development opportunities are written off. 
Should development, redevelopment or construction activity cease,
interest, property taxes, insurance and certain costs would no longer be
eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred.

In accordance with
SFAS 144, we classify a property as “held for sale” when all of the following
criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the
authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the
property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only
to the terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate
a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been
initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be
completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for
sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions
necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that
significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be
withdrawn.  When all of these criteria
have been met, the property is classified as “held for sale”, its operations
are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of
income and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from
continuing operations to discontinued operations.  A loss is recognized for any initial
adjustment of the asset’s carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in
the period the asset qualifies as “held for sale”.

Depreciation of assets ceases upon
designation of a property as “held for sale”. 
Interest expense directly attributable to assets “held for sale” is
classified in discontinued operations.

Conditional
asset retirement obligations

Some of our
properties may have asbestos which, under certain conditions, requires
remediation.  Although we believe that the asbestos is appropriately
contained in accordance with environmental regulations, our practice is to
remediate the asbestos upon the development or redevelopment of the affected
property.  In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations — an

Interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”), we recognize a liability for the fair
value of a conditional asset retirement obligation (including asbestos) when
the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.

F-8

2. Basis
of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Conditional
asset retirement obligations (continued)

In addition, for
certain properties, we have not recognized an asset retirement obligation when
there is an indeterminate settlement date for the obligation because the period
in which we may remediate the obligation may not be estimated with any level of
precision to provide for a meaningful estimate of the retirement obligation.   Conditional asset retirement obligations
totaled approximately $10.8 million and $6.9 million as of December 31,
2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, and are included in accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in the accompanying
balance sheets.

Cash equivalents

We consider all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents.

Tenant security deposits and other restricted cash

Tenant security
deposits and other restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):

Investments

We hold equity
investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities
primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in
publicly-traded companies are considered “available for sale” in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), and are
recorded at fair value.  Fair value has
been determined based upon the closing trading price as of the balance sheet
date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity.  The classification
of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each investment is
made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date.  The cost of investments sold is determined by
the specific identification method, with net realized gains and losses included
in other income.

Investments in privately held entities are generally
accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating
or financial policies of the entities in which we invest.  Certain investments are accounted for under
the equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,
“The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock” (“APB 18”)
and Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46, “Accounting for Limited Partnership
Investments” (“EITF Topic D-46”). Under the equity method of accounting, we
record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the
investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee
subsequent to the date of our investment.

Individual investments are evaluated for impairment
when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that an impairment
exist. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but
are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable
or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new
collaborative agreements. If there are no identified events or changes in
circumstances that would have an adverse effect on our cost method investments,
we do not estimate its fair value. For all of our investments, if a decline in
the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be
other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair
value with a non-cash charge to current earnings.

2. Basis
of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Leasing costs

Costs directly
related and essential to our leasing activities are capitalized and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease.  Costs related to unsuccessful leasing
opportunities are expensed.  Leasing
costs, net of related amortization, totaled approximately $51,819,000 and
$45,980,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Lease origination
costs associated with acquired in-place leases are recorded pursuant to SFAS
141 are included in amounts immediately above and are classified as leasing
costs, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
and amortized over the remaining life of the lease.  The value of lease origination costs
associated with acquired in-place leases, net of related amortization, was
approximately $17,868,000 as of December 31, 2007.  The estimated annual amortization of lease
origination costs associated with acquired in-place leases for each of the five
succeeding years is approximately $4,815,000 for 2008, $4,033,000 for 2009,
$2,633,000 for 2010, $1,839,000 for 2011 and $1,304,000 for 2012.

Loan fees and costs

Fees and costs
incurred in obtaining long-term financing are amortized over the terms of the
related loans and included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.  Loan fees and
costs, net of related amortization, totaled approximately $27,552,000 and
$19,390,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Interest rate swap agreements

We utilize
interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable
interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan.  These agreements
involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the
exchange of the underlying principal amount (the “notional amount”).  Interest received under all of our interest
rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid
and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.

Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”), as amended by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities” establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such as our interest
rate swap agreements.  All of our
interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly effective”
under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates.  In accordance with SFAS 133, we formally
document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and hedged
items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk
strategy.  Accordingly, we have
categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  We make an assessment at the inception of
each interest rate swap agreement and on an on going basis to determine whether
these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows
associated with the hedged items.  The
ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately
recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for
such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as “highly effective”, the
changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected
in earnings.

Pursuant to SFAS
133, interest rate swaps agreements are reflected at their estimated fair
values in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  We use a variety of methods and assumptions
based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to
determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements.  These methods of assessing fair value result
in a general approximation of value.

Accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits

As of December 31, 2007, accounts payable,
accrued expenses and tenant security deposits included accounts

payable
and accrued expenses of approximately $74,082,000 and acquired below-market
leases of approximately $46,703,000. As of December 31, 2006, accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits included accounts
payable and accrued expenses of approximately $49,797,000 and acquired
below-market leases of approximately $36,389,000.

Accumulated other comprehensive income

Accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of the
following (in thousands):

Rental income and tenant recoveries

Rental income from
leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives and other rent
adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease
terms.  We include amounts currently
recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, in deferred
rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Amounts received currently, but recognized as
income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts payable, accrued
expenses and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.  We commence recognition of
rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the
tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property.

Tenant recoveries
related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs
and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the
period the applicable expenses are incurred.

We maintain an
allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our
tenants to make required payments.  If a
tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may
recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of
unpaid rent and unrealized deferred rent. 
As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no allowance for doubtful
accounts.

Interest
income

Interest income
was approximately $1,916,000, $1,303,000 and $578,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, and is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.

Income taxes

As a REIT, we are
not subject to federal income taxation as long as we meet a number of
organizational and operational requirements and make distributions greater than
or equal to 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders. Since we believe we
have met these requirements and our distributions exceeded taxable income, no
federal income tax provision has been reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be
subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum
tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.

of uncertain tax positions is recognized only if it is more likely than not
that the tax position will be sustained, based solely on its technical merits,
with the taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
The measurement of a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that meets the
more likely than not threshold is based on a cumulative probability model under
which the largest amount of tax benefit recognized is the amount with a greater
than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the
taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. As of December 31,
2007, there were no unrecognized tax benefits. We do not anticipate a significant
change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12
months.

Interest expense
and penalties, if any, would be recognized in the first period the interest or
penalty would begin accruing according to the provisions of the relevant tax
law at the applicable statutory rate of interest. We did not incur any tax
related interest expense or penalties for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 or 2005.

During the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we declared dividends on our
common stock of $3.04, $2.86 and $2.72 per share, respectively.  During the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, we declared dividends on our Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock of $0.4108, $2.275 and $2.275 per share,
respectively.  During the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, we declared dividends on our Series C cumulative
redeemable preferred stock of $2.09375, $2.09375 and $2.09375 per share,
respectively.   See Note 12. Preferred
Stock and Excess Stock.

The tax treatment
of distributions on common stock paid in 2007 is as follows: (1) 83.6%
ordinary dividend, (2) 10.0% capital gain at 15%, (3) 5.1% return of
capital, and (4) 1.3% Section 1250 capital gain at 25%.  The tax treatment of distributions on common
stock paid in 2006 is as follows:  (1) 82.1%
ordinary dividend, (2) 12.3% capital gain at 15%, (3) 3.3% return of
capital, and (4) 2.3% Section 1250 capital gain at 25%.  The information provided in this paragraph is
unaudited.

Earnings per share, dividends declared and preferred stock redemption
cost (continued)

Our calculation of weighted average diluted shares pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”
will include additional shares related to our unsecured convertible notes when
the average market price is above the current conversion price. The number of
additional shares that will be included in the weighted average diluted shares is
equal to the number of shares that would be issued upon the settlement of the
unsecured convertible notes assuming the settlement occurred on the end of the
reporting period.

Emerging Issues
Task Force Topic D-42, “The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings Per Share for
the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock” (“EITF Topic D-42”)
provides, among other things, that any excess of (1) the fair value of the
consideration transferred to the holders of preferred stock redeemed over (2) the
carrying amount of the preferred stock, should be subtracted from net earnings
to determine net income available to common stockholders in the calculation of
earnings per share.  The cost to issue
our preferred stock was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital
in the period that the preferred stock was issued.  Upon any redemption of our preferred stock,
the respective offering costs, representing the excess of the fair value of the
consideration transferred to the holders over the carrying amount of the
preferred stock, will be recognized as a dividend to preferred
stockholders.  During 2007, we recorded a
charge of approximately $2,799,000 to net income available to common
stockholders for costs related to the redemption of our 9.10% Series B
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. 
Dividends on preferred stock are deducted from net income to arrive at
net income allocable to common stockholders.

Stock-based compensation expense

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123R”). Under the modified-prospective transition method of
SFAS 123R, compensation cost is recognized over the remaining service period
for the portion of outstanding stock options as of January 1, 2006, for
which the requisite service had not been rendered. The compensation cost is
based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. In addition, SFAS 123R
requires that we account for an estimate of awards that are expected to vest
and to revise the estimate for actual forfeitures. The adoption of SFAS 123R
did not have a material impact on our financial statements since all awards
accounted for under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”) were fully vested prior to the
adoption of SFAS 123R. Effective January 1, 2003, we had adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock- Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”) prospectively to all
employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003. We
have not granted any stock options since 2002.

For 2002 and all prior years, we elected to follow APB 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for our employee and non-employee director stock
options, stock grants and stock appreciation rights. Under APB 25, because the
exercise price of the options we granted equaled the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense related to stock
options has been recognized. Although we elected to follow APB 25 for options
granted prior to January 1, 2003, pro forma information regarding net
income and net income per share is required by SFAS 123R for all periods
presented prior to 2006 as if we had accounted for stock options under the fair
value method under SFAS 123.

per share information):

Impact of
recently issued accounting standards

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141
(R), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”), to create greater consistency in
the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. SFAS 141R
requires a company to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity to be measured at their
fair values as of the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also requires companies to
recognize the fair value of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a one hundred percent
interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired
entity.  In addition, SFAS 141R requires
that acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately
from the business combination and expensed as incurred. SFAS 141R is effective
for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15,
2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of
SFAS 141R on our financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
‘‘Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment
of ARB No. 51’’ (‘‘SFAS 160’’). SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 “Consolidated
Financial Statements,” and requires all entities to report noncontrolling
interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial
statements, but separate from the parent shareholders’ equity.  SFAS No. 160 also requires any acquisitions
or dispositions of noncontrolling interests that do not result in a change of
control to be accounted for as equity transactions.  In addition, SFAS No. 160 requires that
a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated upon a change in control. 
SFAS No. 160 applies to fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008 and is adopted prospectively. The presentation and disclosure requirements
shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Earlier adoption is
prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 160 will result in a reclassification of
minority interest to a separate component of total equity and net income
attributable to noncontrolling interest will no longer be treated as a
reduction to net income but will be shown as a reduction from net income in
calculating net income available to common stockholders.  The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to
have an impact on net income available to common stockholders or earnings per
share attributable to common stockholders.

In August 2007, the FASB released for public
comment a proposed FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) that would affect the accounting
treatment for convertible debt instruments, such as our outstanding unsecured
convertible notes, that may be settled wholly or partially in cash.  The proposed FSP would require that
instruments within its scope be separated into their liability and equity
components at initial recognition by recording the liability component at the
fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity
component and attributing the remaining

F-14

2.  Basis of
presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Impact of recently issued accounting standards (continued)

proceeds from issuance to the equity component. The
excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its initial fair
value would be amortized to interest expense using the interest method.  In addition, the proposed FSP requires that
interest cost for our unsecured convertible notes be accounted for based on our
nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The FASB is expected to begin its
redeliberations of the guidance in the proposed FSP in early 2008. The proposed
FSP may be effective for reporting periods as early as 2008 and is expected to
be applied retrospectively to prior periods. 
If the FSP is issued as proposed, we expect an increase in our non-cash
interest expense associated with our $460 million aggregate principal amount
outstanding of convertible notes that were issued in January 2007,
including non-cash interest expense for prior periods as a result of its
proposed retrospective application.  We
believe the additional non-cash interest expense we may recognize under the
proposed FSP would result in an increase to interest expense as our estimated
nonconvertible debt borrowing rate is higher than the current contractual
coupon rate of 3.70% on our $460 million unsecured convertible notes.  For example, under the proposed FSP, if the
interest rate for our nonconvertible borrowing rate was approximately 2.5%
higher than the current contractual coupon rate of 3.70% on our unsecured
convertible notes, our non-cash interest expense included in net income for the
year ended December 31, 2007 would increase by approximately 8% to 9%. The
proposed FSP, if adopted as proposed, will also increase our non-cash interest
in future periods during which our unsecured convertible notes remain
outstanding. We are currently evaluating our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate
and the overall impact of the proposed FSP on our consolidated financial
statements.  The impact of the proposed
FSP on our consolidated financial statements could be influenced by certain
factors, including the ultimate outcome of the final rules under the
proposed FSP.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities —
Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS 159”).
SFAS 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that
are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and
losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been
elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is
effective January 1, 2008.   We do
not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS
157”), which provides a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the
definition of fair value within the framework and expands disclosures about the
use of fair value measurements.  SFAS 157
applies to all existing pronouncements under GAAP that require or permit the
use of fair value measurements, except for SFAS 123R.  SFAS 157 is effective for fair value
measurements beginning in our first quarter of 2008.  We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to
have a material impact on our financial statements.

In December 2005, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets”
(“SFAS 153”), which amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29, “Accounting
for Nonmonetary Transactions.”  SFAS 153
addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the
scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair values of the
assets exchanged.  SFAS 153 was effective
for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in our third quarter of 2005.  The adoption of SFAS 153 did not have a
material impact on our financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections” (“SFAS 154”), which replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20,
“Accounting Changes” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 3,
“Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements”.  SFAS 154 requires retrospective application
to prior periods’ financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting
principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific
effects or the cumulative effect of the change. 
SFAS 154 was effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors
beginning in 2006.  The adoption of SFAS
154 did not have an impact on our financial statements.

3.  Rental
properties, net and properties undergoing development and redevelopment and
land held for development

Rental properties,
net consisted of the following (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, certain of our
rental properties were encumbered by deeds of trust and assignments of rents
and leases associated with the properties. See Note 5, Secured Notes
Payable.  The net book values of
encumbered rental properties as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 were
approximately $1,489,994,000 and $1,107,526,000, respectively.

We lease space
under noncancelable leases with remaining terms of up to 16 years.

In July 2006, we completed the acquisition of a
90% equity interest in the leasehold interest in 10.4 acres commonly known as
Technology Square (“Tech Square”) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”)
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The remaining 10% equity interest was retained by
MIT. MIT is also a tenant at Tech Square occupying approximately 178,952
rentable square feet as of December 31, 2007. The results of Tech Square’s
operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since
that date. Tech Square consists of a seven building campus (including a 1,593
space covered car parking garage and a 49 space surface parking lot) containing
approximately 1.2 million rentable square feet and is subject to a ground lease
with an affiliate of MIT through December 31, 2064.

In accordance with FAS 141, in July 2006, we
allocated the purchase price of Tech Square based upon the relative fair values
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including rental properties of
approximately $616 million, other assets of approximately $5 million, secured
notes payable of approximately $220 million, acquired below-market leases of
approximately $26 million and minority interest of approximately $37 million.
The weighted average amortization period related to the acquired below market
leases was approximately 6 years.

Our financial statements, on an unaudited pro forma
basis, for the acquisition of Tech Square, the issuance of 2.5 million shares
of common stock with proceeds of approximately $232 million and borrowings on
our unsecured line of credit of approximately $106 million as if it had
occurred on January 1, 2005, would have reflected total consolidated
revenues of approximately $347.5 million and $287.6 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net income available to common
stockholders would have been approximately $60.6 million and $51.9 million for
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net income
available to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis would have been
$2.21 and $2.18 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  All other properties
acquired during 2006 comprise a series of individually insignificant unrelated
transactions, both individually and in aggregate, and have been excluded from
this pro forma analysis.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had
approximately $1.1 billion and $596 million, respectively, undergoing
development, redevelopment and pre-construction activities.  In accordance with SFAS 34, we are required
to capitalize interest during the period an asset is undergoing activities to
prepare it for its intended use. 
Capitalization of interest ceases after a project is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use. 
In addition, should construction activity cease, interest would be
expensed as incurred.  Total interest
capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
approximately $56,036,000, $35,282,000 and $27,490,000, respectively. Total
interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
approximately $145,066,000, $107,643,000 and $77,695,000, respectively.

4.  Investments

We hold equity
investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities
primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in
publicly-traded companies are considered “available for sale” in accordance
with SFAS 115, and are recorded at fair value. 
Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under
the cost method because we do not influence any operating or financial policies
of the entities in which we invest. 
Certain investments are accounted for under the equity method in
accordance with APB 18 and EITF Topic D-46. 
For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an
investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary,
such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash
charge to current earnings. The factors that we consider in making these
assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions,
prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product
initiatives and new collaborative agreements. 
For additional discussion of our accounting policies with respect to
investments, see Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.

The following
table summarizes our available-for-sale securities (in thousands):

Investments in available-for-sale securities with
gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 have been in a
continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months.  We have the ability and intent to hold these
investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a recovery of our
investment.  We believe that these
unrealized losses are temporary and accordingly we have not recognized an
other-than-temporary impairment related to available-for-sale securities as of December 31,
2007 and 2006.

Our investments in privately held entities as of December 31,
2007 and 2006 totaled approximately $56,126,000 and $48,642,000,
respectively.  Of these totals,
approximately $55,841,000 and $48,013,000 are accounted for under the cost
method.  The remainder

($285,000 and $629,000 for 2007 and 2006, respectively) are
accounted for under the equity method in accordance with APB 18 and EITF Topic
D-46.  As of December 31, 2007 and
2006, there were no unrealized losses in our investments in privately held
entities.

F-17

Investments (continued)

Net investment income of approximately $11,700,000,
$7,138,000, and $2,294,000 was recognized in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
and is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income.  Net investment income in 2007
consisted of equity in loss of approximately $330,000 related to investments in
privately held entities accounted for under the equity method, gross realized
gains of approximately $12,216,000, and gross realized losses of approximately
$186,000.  For the year ended December 31,
2007, approximately $7,620,000 was reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to realized gains and is included in other income.  Net investment income in 2006 consisted of
equity in loss of approximately $632,000 related to investments in privately
held entities accounted for under the equity method, gross realized gains of
approximately $8,305,000, and gross realized losses of approximately
$535,000.  Net investment income in 2005
consisted of equity in income of approximately $483,000 related to investments
in privately held entities accounted for under the equity method, gross realized
gains of approximately $2,433,000, and gross realized losses of approximately
$622,000.

5.  Secured
notes payable

Secured notes
payable totaled approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2007 and
2006. Our secured notes payable had weighted average interest rates of
approximately 6.08% and 6.21% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
with maturity dates ranging from January 2008 to August 2016.

Our secured notes
payable generally require monthly payments of principal and interest.  The total net book values of rental
properties, net and properties undergoing development and redevelopment and
land held for development securing debt were approximately $1.9 billion and
$1.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  At December 31, 2007, our secured notes
payable were comprised of approximately $902.9 million and $310.0 million of
fixed and variable rate debt, respectively, compared to approximately $940.0
million and $234.9 million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively, at December 31,
2006.

Future principal payments due on secured notes payable
as of December 31, 2007, are as follows (dollars in thousands):

The weighted average interest rate
related to payments on our secured notes payable is calculated based on the
outstanding debt as of December 31st of the year immediately preceding the
year presented.

6.  Unsecured line of credit and unsecured
term loan

In May 2007,
we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement to
increase the maximum permitted borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities
from $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion consisting of a $1.15 billion unsecured line
of credit and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to
increase commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an
additional $500 million.

Our unsecured line
of credit, as amended, bears interest at a floating rate based on our election
of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank’s reference rate and the
Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a
LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months. Our unsecured line of credit
matures in

F-18

6.  Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan (continued)

October 2010
and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period.  As of December 31, 2007, we had
borrowings of $365 million outstanding on our unsecured line of credit with a
weighted average interest rate of approximately 6.07%.

Our unsecured term
loan bears interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a
LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank’s reference rate and the Federal
Funds rate plus 0.5%.  For each
LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months.  Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2011
and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period.  As of December 31, 2007, we had
borrowings of $750 million outstanding on our unsecured term loan with a
weighted average interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap
agreements, of approximately 5.84%.

Our unsecured line
of credit and our unsecured term loan contain financial covenants that include,
among other things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a leverage ratio and a
fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan restrict, among other things, certain
investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers.

Aggregate
unsecured borrowings may be limited to an amount based primarily on the net
operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties.  Aggregate unsecured borrowings may increase
as we complete the development, redevelopment or acquisition of additional
unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2007, aggregate unsecured
borrowings were limited to approximately $2.1 billion.

7.  Unsecured
convertible notes

In January 2007,
we completed a private offering of $460 million of convertible notes that are
due in 2027 (the “Notes”) with a coupon of 3.70%.  The Notes have an initial conversion rate of
approximately 8.4774 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the
Notes.  The initial conversion price of
approximately $117.96 per share of our common stock represented a premium of
20% based on the last reported sale price of $98.30 per share of our common
stock on January 10, 2007.  The net
proceeds from this offering, after underwriters’ discount, were approximately
$450.8 million.

Holders of the
Notes may convert their Notes into cash and, if applicable, shares of our
common stock prior to stated maturity only under the following
circumstances:  (1) the Notes will
be convertible during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending March 31,
2007, if the closing sale price of our common stock for each of 20 or more
trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the
conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
calendar quarter; (2) the Notes will be convertible during the five
consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day
period (the “Note Measurement Period”) in which the average trading price per
$1,000 principal amount of Notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average
conversion value of the Notes during the Note Measurement Period; (3) the
Notes will be convertible upon the occurrence of specified corporate
transactions, including a change in control, certain merger or consolidation
transactions or the liquidation of the Company; (4) the Notes will be
convertible if we call the Notes for redemption; and (5) the Notes will be
convertible at any time from, and including, December 15, 2026 until the
close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15,
2027 or earlier redemption or repurchase. 
As of December 31, 2007, the Notes had a conversion rate of
approximately 8.4842 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes and
a conversion price of approximately $117.87 per share of our common stock.

Prior to January 15,
2012, we will not have the right to redeem the Notes, except to preserve our
qualification as a real estate investment trust.  On and after that date, we have the right to
redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for
cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus any
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Holders of the
Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes, in whole or in part, on January 15,
2012, 2017 and 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the
repurchase date.

F-19

8.  Interest rate swap agreements

We utilize
interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable
interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan.  These agreements
involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the
exchange of the underlying principal amount (the “notional amount”).  Interest received under all of our interest
rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid
and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.

SFAS 133, as
amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
financial instruments such as our interest rate swap agreements.  All of our interest rate swap agreements meet
the criteria to be deemed “highly effective” under SFAS 133 in reducing our
exposure to variable interest rates.  In
accordance with SFAS 133, we formally document all relationships between
interest rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for
evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. 
Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  We make an assessment at the inception of each
interest rate swap agreement and on an on going basis to determine whether
these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows
associated with the hedged items.  The
ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately
recognized in earnings.  While we intend
to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not
qualify as “highly effective”, the changes in the fair values of the
derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.

As of December 31,
2007 and 2006, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits and other assets at
their fair values aggregating a liability balance of approximately $26.9
million and an asset balance of approximately $1.0 million, respectively, with
the offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized losses and gains in
accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.  Balances in accumulated other comprehensive
income are recognized in earnings as swap payments are made.  For the year ended December 31, 2007,
approximately $3.6 million was reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to interest expense as a reduction to interest expense.
During the next twelve months, we expect to reclassify approximately $6.8
million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as an
increase to interest expense.

related to our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (dollars in
thousands):

9.  Commitments and contingencies

Employee retirement savings plan

We have a
retirement savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code whereby our employees may contribute a portion of their
compensation to their respective retirement accounts, in an amount not to
exceed the maximum allowed under the Internal Revenue Code.  In addition to employee contributions, we have
elected to provide discretionary profit sharing contributions (subject to
statutory limitations), which amounted to approximately $941,000, $850,000, and
$552,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005. Employees who participate in the plan are immediately vested in their
contributions and in the contributions of the company.

Concentration of credit risk

We maintain our
cash and cash equivalents at insured financial institutions.  The combined account balances at each
institution periodically exceed FDIC insurance coverage, and, as a result,
there is a concentration of credit risk

related to amounts in
excess of FDIC insurance coverage.  We
are dependent on rental income from relatively few tenants in the life science
industry.  The inability of any single
tenant to make its lease payments could adversely affect our operations.  As of December 31, 2007, we held 391
leases with a total of 323 tenants and 90 of our 166 properties were each
leased to a single tenant.  At December 31,
2007, our three largest tenants accounted for approximately 13.4% of our
aggregate annualized base rent.

F-21

9.  Commitments and contingencies (continued)

We generally do
not require collateral or other security from our tenants, other than security
deposits.  In addition to security
deposits held in cash, we held approximately $62.1 million in irrevocable letters
of credit available from certain tenants as security deposits for 150 leases as
of December 31, 2007.

Commitments

As of December 31,
2007, we were committed under the terms of contracts to complete the
construction of properties undergoing development and redevelopment and land
held for development at a remaining aggregate cost of approximately $361.4
million.

As of December 31,
2007, we were also committed to fund approximately $18.3 million for the
construction of building infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases
and/or construction contracts and approximately $33.4 million for certain
investments.

As of December 31,
2007, we were committed under the terms of 19 ground leases.  These lease obligations totaling
approximately $635.2 million have remaining lease terms of 25 to 99 years,
exclusive of extension options.  In
addition, as of December 31, 2007, we were committed under the terms of
certain operating leases for our headquarters and field offices.  These lease obligations totaling
approximately $5.4 million have remaining lease terms of one to five years,
exclusive of extension options.

10.  Minority interest

Minority interest
represents the third party interests in certain entities in which we have a
controlling interest and a third party interest in a variable interest entity
in which we are the primary beneficiary. 
These entities own nine properties and two development parcels and are
included in our consolidated financial statements.  Minority interest is adjusted for additional
contributions, distributions to minority holders and the minority holders’
proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity.

Minority interest is
adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to minority holders and the
minority holders’ proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each
respective entity.  Distributions,
profits and losses related to these entities are allocated in accordance with
the respective operating agreements.

As of December 31, 2007, we
were the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity which owns a
development parcel with a carrying value of approximately $72.8 million.  The development parcel serves as collateral
for a non-recourse secured loan of approximately $38.2 million. As of December 31,
2007, the minority interest balance related to this entity was approximately
$15.3 million. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate minority interest
balance was approximately $75.5 million and is classified as minority interest
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

11.  Issuances of common stock

In September 2007,
we sold 2,300,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including
the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option).  The shares were issued at a
price of $96.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately
$215 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs).

In September 2006,
we sold 2,500,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering.  The shares were issued at a price of $94.75
per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $232.2 million
(after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs).  In June 2006, we sold 3,795,000 shares
of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including the shares issued upon
exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option).  The shares were issued at a price of $84.00
per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $303.1 million
(after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs).

12.  Preferred stock and excess stock

Series B
cumulative redeemable preferred stock

In January 2002,
we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of our 9.10% Series B
cumulative redeemable preferred stock (“Series B preferred stock”)
(including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment
option).   The shares were issued at a
price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately
$55.1 million (after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering
costs).   The dividends on our Series B
preferred stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of issuance.  We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an
annual rate of $2.275 per share.  Our Series B
preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or
mandatory redemption and is not redeemable prior to January 22, 2007,
except in order to preserve our status as a REIT.  Investors in our Series B preferred
stock generally have no voting rights.

In February 2007,
we called for redemption of our Series B preferred stock.  The Series B preferred stock was
redeemed in March 2007 at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share
plus $0.4107639 per share representing accumulated and unpaid dividends to the
redemption date.  In accordance with EITF
Topic D-42, we recorded a charge of approximately $2,799,000 to net income
available to common stockholders for costs related to the redemption of the Series B
preferred stock.

Series C
cumulative redeemable preferred stock

In June 2004,
we completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our 8.375% Series C
cumulative redeemable preferred stock (“Series C preferred stock”)
(including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option).  The shares were issued at a
price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately
$124.0 million (after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering costs).  The proceeds were used to redeem our Series A
preferred stock with the remaining portion used to pay down our unsecured line
of credit.  The dividends on our Series C
preferred stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original
issuance.  We pay dividends quarterly in
arrears at an annual rate of $2.09375 per share.  Our Series C preferred stock has no
stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and
is not redeemable prior to June 29, 2009, except in order to preserve our
status as a REIT.  Investors in our Series C
preferred stock generally have no voting rights.  On or after June 29, 2009, we may, at
our option, redeem our Series C preferred stock, in whole or in part, at
any time for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and
unpaid dividends.

Preferred stock and excess stock authorizations

Our charter
authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of
which 5,185,500 shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31,
2007. In addition, 200,000,000 shares of “excess stock” (as defined) are
authorized, none of which were issued and outstanding at December 31,
2007.

13. Stock
option plans and stock grants

1997 Stock plan

In 1997, we
adopted a stock option and incentive plan (the “Stock Plan”) for the purpose of
attracting and retaining the highest quality personnel, providing for
additional incentives and promoting the success of the company by providing
employees the opportunity to acquire common stock pursuant to (i) options
to purchase common stock; and (ii) share awards. As of December 31,
2007, a total of 973,881 shares were reserved for the granting of future
options and share awards under the Stock Plan.

Options under our
plan have been granted at prices that are equal to the market value of the
stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. We
have not granted any stock options since 2002. The options outstanding under
the Stock Plan expire at various dates through October 2012.

13. Stock
option plans and stock grants (continued)

The fair values of
the options issued under the Stock Plan were estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for 2007, 2006 and 2005:

A summary of the
stock option activity under our Stock Plan and related information for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 follows:

13. Stock
option plans and stock grants (continued)

The following
table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at
December 31, 2007:

The aggregate
intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2007 was
approximately $15.3 million.

In addition, the
Stock Plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees and non-employee
directors.  A share award is an award of
common stock, which (i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may
be subject to the risk of forfeiture under Section 83 of the Internal
Revenue Code.  Shares issued generally
vest over a one to three year period from the date of issuance and the sale of
the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.   The unearned portion of these awards is
amortized as stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period.

As of December 31,
2007 and 2006 there were 457,956 and 444,349, respectively, nonvested share
awards outstanding.  During 2007, we
granted 294,376 shares of common stock, 275,487 share awards vested and 5,282  shares were forfeited.  During 2006, we granted 286,569 shares of
common stock, 105,782 share awards vested and 7,975 shares were forfeited.  During 2005, we granted 162,387 shares of
common stock, 52,143 share awards vested and 300 shares were forfeited. The
weighted average grant-date fair value of share awards granted during 2007 was
approximately $102.33 per share and the total fair value of share awards
vested, based on the market price on the vesting date, was approximately $26.7
million.  As of December 31, 2007,
there was $33.8 million of unrecognized compensation related to nonvested share
awards under the Stock Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of approximately one year. 
Capitalized stock compensation was approximately $8,677,000, $3,741,000
and $1,602,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included as a
reduction of general and administrative costs in the accompanying statements of
income.
