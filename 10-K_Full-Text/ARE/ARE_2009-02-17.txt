ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

General

We are a Maryland
corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT
for federal income tax purposes.  We
are the largest owner and pre-eminent first-in-class REIT focused
principally on science-driven cluster formation.  We are the
leading provider of high-quality environmentally sustainable real estate,
technical infrastructure and services to the broad and diverse life science
industry.  Client tenants include institutional (universities and
independent not-for-profit institutions), pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical,
medical device, product, service, and translational entities, as well as


government
agencies.  Our operating platform is based on the principle of “clustering,”
with assets and operations located in key life science markets.  As of December 31,
2008, we had 159 properties (155 properties located in ten states in the United
States and four properties located in Canada) containing approximately 11.7
million rentable square feet (including spaces undergoing active redevelopment)
and properties undergoing ground-up development of approximately 875,000
rentable square feet.

Business
and strategy

We focus our property
operations and investment activities principally in the following life science
markets:

·

California – Los
Angeles Metro;

·

California – San
Diego;

·

California – San
Francisco Bay;

·

Eastern
Massachusetts;

·

New
Jersey/Suburban Philadelphia;

·

New York City;

·

Southeast;

·

Suburban
Washington, D.C.;

·

Washington –
Seattle; and

·

International.

Our tenant base is broad
and diverse within the life science industry and reflects our focus on
regional, national and international tenants with substantial financial and
operational resources.  For a more
detailed description of our properties and tenants, see “Item 2. Properties”.  We have an experienced Board of Directors and
are led by a senior management team with extensive experience in both the real
estate and life science industries.

2008 demonstrated the
strength and durability of our core operations providing office/laboratory
space to the broad and diverse life science industry.  Our operating
results have been steady over the period from our initial public offering in May 1997
through December 31, 2008.  Our core
operating results were solid for 2008, during a period of an extraordinary and
unprecedented United States and worldwide economic, financial, banking and
credit market crises, the onset of a significant worldwide economic recession
and drastic decline in consumer confidence and the consumer driven economy.
Financial systems throughout the world have become illiquid with banks much
less willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers.
Consequently, there is greater uncertainty regarding our ability to access the
credit markets in order to attract financing or capital on reasonable terms or
on any terms.

The current economic, financial and banking environment, worldwide
economic recession and lack of consumer confidence have caused and mandated
significant reductions to our capital expenditures across all areas of our
business, including operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, and
development and construction.  We intend
to focus on preservation of capital while maintaining future long term growth
prospects.  We intend to significantly
reduce our capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 and focus on the
completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating
approximately 590,057 rentable square feet and our existing active development
projects aggregating approximately 875,000 rentable square feet. Additionally,
we intend to continue with pre-construction activities for certain land parcels
for future ground-up/vertical above ground development in order to preserve and
create value.  These important
pre-construction activities add significant value to our land for future
ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction
of the buildings.  We also intend to be
very careful and prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to our
active ground-up/vertical developments. 
Future reductions in construction activities will reduce our capital
expenditures.  However, if construction
activities (including pre-construction activities) cease, certain construction
and or pre-construction costs, including interest, taxes, insurance, payroll
and other costs, will be expensed as incurred. 
We also intend to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital
structure over a multi-year period. 
During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt
maturities.   We expect the source of
funds over several years for the repayment of outstanding debt to be provided
by opportunistic sales of real estate, joint ventures and through the issuance
of additional equity securities, as appropriate.  As of December 31, 2008, we had
identified three assets “held for sale” which have been classified in
discontinued operations.


We seek to maximize funds
from operations (“FFO”), balance sheet liquidity and flexibility and cash
available for distribution to our stockholders through the ownership,
operation, management and selective redevelopment, development and acquisition
of life science properties, as well as management of our balance sheet.  See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Funds From Operations”
for a discussion of how we compute and view FFO, as well as a discussion of
other measures of cash flow. In particular, we seek to maximize FFO, balance
sheet liquidity and flexibility and cash available for distribution by:

·

maintaining a solid,
liquid and flexible balance sheet;

·

retenanting and
re-leasing space at higher rental rates while minimizing tenant improvement
costs;

·

maintaining
solid occupancy while also maintaining high lease rental rates;

·

realizing
contractual rental rate escalations, which are currently provided for in
approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis);

·

implementing
effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions
in tenant leases for operating expenses and certain capital expenditures;

·

improving
investment returns through leasing of vacant space and replacement of existing tenants
with new tenants at higher rental rates;

·

achieving higher
rental rates from existing tenants as existing leases expire;

·

selectively
redeveloping existing office, warehouse, shell space or newly acquired
properties into generic laboratory space that can be leased at higher rental
rates in our target life science cluster markets; and

·

selectively
developing properties in our target life science cluster markets.

Redevelopment

A key component of our
long term business is redevelopment of existing office, warehouse or shell
space as generic laboratory space that can be leased at higher rates.  As of December 31, 2008, we had
approximately 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing redevelopment at 13
properties.  In addition to properties
undergoing redevelopment, as of December 31, 2008, our asset base
contained embedded opportunities for a future permanent change of use to
office/laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating approximately 1.6
million rentable square feet.  However,
new commitments for significant additional redevelopment projects are not
strategic priorities in the near term.

Development

Another key component of
our long term business is ground-up development projects.  Our development strategy is primarily to
pursue selective projects where we expect to achieve appropriate investment
returns.  We generally have undertaken
ground-up development projects only if our investment in infrastructure will be
substantially made for generic, rather than tenant specific, improvements. As of
December 31, 2008, we had five parcels of land undergoing ground-up
development approximating 875,000 rentable square feet of office/laboratory
space.  We also have an embedded pipeline
for future ground-up development approximating 9.6 million developable square
feet of office/laboratory space. 
However, new commitments for significant additional ground-up
developments are not strategic priorities in the near term.

Tenants

As of December 31, 2008, we had 416 leases with a total of 347
tenants, and 79 of our 159 properties were single-tenant properties.  Our three largest tenants accounted for
approximately 14.3% of our aggregate annualized base rent, or approximately
7.2%, 4.4% and 2.7%, respectively. None of our tenants represented more than
10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008.


Competition

In general, other life
science properties are located in close proximity to our properties. The amount
of rentable space available in any market could have a material effect on our
ability to rent space and on the rents that we can earn.  In addition, we compete for investment
opportunities with insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private
equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies, other REITs,
and owner/occupants. Many of these entities have substantially greater
financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more than us or accept
more risk than we are willing to accept. 
These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the
creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic concentration of their
investments.  Competition may also reduce
the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase
the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.  Competition in acquiring existing properties
and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other REITs, has
been very strong over the past several years. We believe we have differentiated
ourselves from our competitors, as we are the largest owner, manager and
developer of life science properties, in key life science markets.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS

The global financial crisis,
and other events or circumstances beyond the control of the Company, may
adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations, contractual
commitments, and access to capital.

What began
initially as a “subprime” mortgage crisis has turned into an extraordinary
United States and worldwide structural economic and financial crisis coupled
with the rapid decline of the consumer economy. Recently, significant concerns
over energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit,
the United States mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the
United States have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations
for the economy and the markets going forward. 
These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and
consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated a steep
economic decline and fears of a deep and prolonged recession.  Further, severe financial and structural
strains on the banking and financial systems have led to significant lack of
trust and confidence in the global credit and financial system.  Consumers and money managers have liquidated
equity investments and consumers and banks have held cash and other lower risk
investments, resulting in significant and, in some cases, catastrophic declines
in the equity capitalization of companies and unusual failures of financial
institutions.  Additionally, financial
systems throughout the world are undergoing severe structural changes with
banks much less willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and
borrowers.  This extraordinary level of
illiquidity has caused a significant decline in available credit from financial
institutions and other lenders and the unprecedented declines in the market
values of United States and foreign stock exchanges has led to significantly
higher cost of debt and equity capital.

The United States
and foreign governments have taken extraordinary actions in an attempt to deal
with the worldwide financial crisis and the severe decline in the consumer
driven economy.  These extraordinary
actions, including the merger of large financial institutions and significant
investment in and control by government bodies, has so far resulted in
limited or no relief to the credit markets, and there is no assurance that
their actions will ultimately be successful. 
Additionally, extraordinary government controls have been attempted,
including a temporary ban of “short sales” on certain publicly traded stocks
and guarantees of money market funds, which have also resulted in limited
relief, if any, to the credit markets. 
The resulting and ongoing lack of available credit, lack of lending
between financial institutions and other key lending sources (such as life
insurance companies and pension funds), lack of lending to borrowers and
further failures and consolidation of
financial institutions could materially and adversely affect our
tenants, key vendors and contractors, financial condition, results of
operations, ability to fund our construction activities, ability to refinance
debt and other capital needs and our access to capital.

There
can be no assurance that actions of the United States Government, Federal
Reserve, and other government and regulatory bodies for the purpose of
stabilizing the financial markets will achieve the intended effect.

In an unprecedented
response to the financial and economic crises affecting the banking system and
financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other
financial institutions, on October 3, 2008, former President Bush signed
the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) into law.  Pursuant to the EESA, the United States Treasury
has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of
mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions for the
purpose of stabilizing the financial markets. 
The federal government, the Federal Reserve Board, and other government
and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering other actions to address
the financial crisis.  There can be no
assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets,
including the extreme levels of volatility currently being experienced.  Such continued volatility could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations, or the trading price of our common stock.

Current
levels of market volatility are unprecedented.

The capital and credit
markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 12
months.  In some cases, the markets have
produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain
issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial and/or operating
strength.  If current levels of market
disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we
will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 
Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also
limit our access to capital from financial institutions on favorable terms, or
at all, and our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity
securities could be adversely affected by causes beyond the control of the
Company through ongoing extraordinary disruptions in the global economy and
financial systems or other events.


We may not
be able to obtain additional capital to further our business objectives.

Our ability to develop,
redevelop or acquire properties depends upon our ability to obtain
capital.  The real estate industry is
currently experiencing a debt and equity capital market that is virtually
frozen.  This lack of capital is expected
to cause a decrease in the level of new investment activity by publicly traded
real estate companies.  A prolonged
period in which we cannot effectively access the public equity or debt markets
may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing sources to undertake
new investments.  An inability to obtain
equity or debt capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from
acquiring, financing and completing desirable investments, and which could
otherwise adversely affect our business. 
Also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or interests in
subsidiaries to fund future operations could dilute the ownership of our
then-existing stockholders.  Even as
liquidity returns to the market, debt and equity capital may be more expensive
than in prior years.

Possible future sales of shares of our common stock
could adversely affect its market price.

We cannot predict the
effect, if any, of future sales of shares of our common stock on the market price
of our common stock from time to time. 
Sales of substantial amounts of capital stock (including common stock
issued upon the exercise of stock options, the conversion of convertible debt
securities or the conversion or redemption of preferred stock), or the
perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing market
prices for our common stock.

We have reserved a number
of shares of common stock for issuance to our officers, directors and employees
pursuant to our Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan
(sometimes referred to herein as our equity incentive plan).  As of December 31, 2008, a total of
942,510 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under our Amended
and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan.

As of December 31,
2008, options to purchase 186,054 shares of our common stock were outstanding,
all of which were exercisable.  We have
filed a registration statement with respect to the issuance of shares of our
common stock pursuant to grants under our equity incentive plan.  In addition, any shares issued under our
equity incentive plan will be available for sale in the public market from time
to time without restriction by persons who are not our “affiliates” (as defined
in Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act).  Affiliates will be able to sell shares of our
common stock pursuant to exemptions from registration requirements or upon
registration.

The price per share of our stock may fluctuate
significantly.

The
market price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in
response to many factors, including:

·

the availability of
debt and/or equity capital;

·

the condition of our
balance sheet;

·

the condition of the
financial and banking industries;

·

actual or anticipated
variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends;

·

the amount and timing
of debt maturities and other contractual obligations;

·

changes in our FFO or
earnings estimates;

·

the publication of
research reports about us, the real estate industry, or the life science
industry;

·

the general reputation
of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to
other debt or equity securities (including securities issued by other real
estate-based companies);

·

general stock and bond
market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income
securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a
higher annual yield from future dividends;

·

changes in our analyst
ratings;

·

changes in market
valuations of similar companies;

·

adverse market reaction
to any additional debt we incur in the future;

·

additions or departures
of key management personnel;

·

actions by
institutional stockholders;

·

speculation in the
press or investment community;

·

terrorist activity
adversely affecting the markets in which our securities trade, possibly
increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and
consumer confidence and spending;

·

government regulatory
action and changes in tax laws;

·

the realization of any
of the other risk factors included in this annual report on Form 10-K; and

·

general market and
economic conditions.


Many
of the factors listed above are beyond our control.  These factors may cause the market price of
shares of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition,
results of operations, business or our prospects.

Our debt
service obligations may have adverse consequences on our business operations.

We use debt to finance
our operations, including development, redevelopment and acquisitions of properties.
Our use of debt may have adverse consequences, including the following:

·

our cash flow
from operations may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal
and interest;

·

we may be forced
to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms,
to make payments on our debt;

·

we may default
on our debt obligations, and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our
properties that secure those loans;

·

a foreclosure on
one of our properties could create taxable income without any accompanying cash
proceeds to pay the tax;

·

a default under
a mortgage loan that has cross default provisions may cause us to automatically
default on another loan;

·

we may not be
able to refinance or extend our existing debt;

·

the terms of any
refinancing or extension may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing
debt;

·

we may be
subject to a significant increase in the variable interest rates on our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and certain other borrowings,
which could adversely impact our operations; and

·

the terms of our
debt obligations may require a reduction in our distributions to stockholders.

As of December 31,
2008, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion,
secured by 64 properties and four land development parcels, and outstanding
debt under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan of
approximately $1.4 billion. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we had
$460 million of 3.70% unsecured convertible notes outstanding.

We may not
be able to refinance our debt.

Due to the high volume of
real estate debt financing in recent years, the industry may require more funds
to refinance debt maturities than the potential funds available by
lenders.  This potential shortage of
available funds from lenders may limit our ability to refinance our debt as it
matures, our cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders,
our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our
common stock.

We may not
be able to borrow additional amounts under our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan.

Aggregate unsecured
borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan is
limited to an amount based primarily on the net operating income derived from a
pool of unencumbered properties and our cost basis of certain land and
construction projects and compliance with certain financial and non-financial
covenants.  Borrowings under our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan are funded by a group of
approximately 50 banks.  Our ability to
borrow additional amounts under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan may be negatively impacted by a decrease in cash flows from our
properties, a default or cross default under our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan, non-compliance of one or more loan covenants and
non-performance or failure of one or more lenders under our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan. In addition, we may not be able to refinance or
repay outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit or unsecured term
loan.  Our inability to borrow additional
amounts could delay or prevent us from acquiring, financing and completing
desirable investments, which could adversely affect our business; and our
inability to refinance or repay amounts under our unsecured line of credit or
unsecured term loan may adversely affect our cash flows, ability to make
distributions to our stockholders, financial condition and results of
operations.


Our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict our ability to engage
in some business activities.

Our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan contain customary negative covenants and other
financial and operating covenants that, among other things:

·

restrict our
ability to incur additional indebtedness;

·

restrict our
ability to make certain investments;

·

restrict our
ability to merge with another company;

·

restrict our
ability to make distributions to stockholders;

·

require us to
maintain financial coverage ratios; and

·

require us to
maintain a pool of unencumbered assets approved by the lenders.

These
restrictions could cause us to default on our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan or negatively affect our operations and our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders.

We could
become highly leveraged and our debt service obligations could increase.

Our organizational
documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur.  Therefore, we could become highly
leveraged.  This would result in an
increase in our debt service obligations that could adversely affect our cash
flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.  Higher leverage could also increase the risk
of default on our debt obligations.

If
interest rates rise, our debt service costs will increase and the value of our
properties may decrease.

Our unsecured line of
credit, unsecured term loan and certain other borrowings bear interest at
variable rates, and we may incur additional debt in the future.  Increases in market interest rates would
increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase
the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt.  Additionally, increases in market interest
rates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and decrease the
market price of our common stock. 
Accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our financial
position and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Failure to
hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our
results of operations.

The interest rate
swap agreements we use to manage some of our exposure to interest rate
volatility involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to
honor their obligations under these arrangements.  In addition, these arrangements may not be
effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.  These risk factors may lead to failure to
hedge effectively against changes in interest rates and therefore may adversely
affect our results of operations.

We are subject to risks and
liabilities in connection with properties owned through partnerships, limited
liability companies and joint ventures.

Our organizational
documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in non-wholly
owned partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures.  Partnership, limited liability company or
joint venture investments involve certain risks, including:

·

upon bankruptcy
of non-wholly owned partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint venture
entities, we remain liable for the partnership’s, limited liability company’s
or joint venture’s liabilities;

·

we may share
certain approval rights over major decisions of third parties;

·

we may be required
to contribute such capital if our partners fail to fund their share of any
required capital contributions;

·

our partners,
co-members or joint ventures might have economic or other business interests or
goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would
affect our ability to operate the property or our ability to maintain our
qualification as a REIT;

·

our ability to
sell the interest when we desire on advantageous terms may be limited or
restricted under the terms of our agreements with our partners; and

·

we may not
continue to own or operate the interests or assets underlying such relationship
or may need to purchase such interests or assets at an above market price to
continue ownership.


We generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships,
limited liability companies and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our
business objectives. However, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence
of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to make
distributions to our stockholders or the market price of our common stock.

The conversion rights of our unsecured convertible
notes may be detrimental to holders of our common stock.

We have $460 million of unsecured convertible notes that
are due in 2027 (the “Notes”) with a coupon of 3.70%.

Prior to January 15, 2012, we will not have the
right to redeem the Notes, except to preserve our qualification as a REIT.  On and after that date, we have the right to
redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for
cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus
any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.  Holders of the Notes may require us to
repurchase their Notes, in whole or in part, on January 15, 2012, 2017 and
2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be
purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase
date.  At issuance, the Notes had an
initial conversion rate of approximately 8.4774 common shares per $1,000
principal amount of the Notes representing a conversion price of approximately
$117.96 per share of our common stock. 
This initial conversion price represented a premium of 20% based on the
last reported sale price of $98.30 per share of our common stock on January 10,
2007.  The conversion rate of the Notes
is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to,
certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.74 per share per quarter
and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2008, the Notes had a
conversion rate of approximately 8.5070 common shares per $1,000 principal
amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately
$117.55 per share of our common stock. 
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes into cash and, if
applicable, shares of our common stock prior to the stated maturity on the
Notes only under the following circumstances: 
(1) the Notes will be convertible during any calendar quarter after
the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2007, if the closing sale price of
our common stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately
preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price in effect on
the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) the
Notes will be convertible during the five consecutive business days immediately
after any five consecutive trading day period (the “Note Measurement Period”)
in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was equal
to or less than 98% of the average conversion value of the Notes during the
Note Measurement Period; (3) the Notes will be convertible upon the
occurrence of specified corporate transactions, including a change in control,
certain merger or consolidation transactions or the liquidation of the Company;
(4) the Notes will be convertible if we call the Notes for redemption; and
(5) the Notes will be convertible at any time from, and including, December 15,
2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15,
2027 or earlier redemption or repurchase. 
The Note Measurement Period is the five

consecutive
trading day period following a request by a holder of the Notes to convert his
Notes.

The conversion of the Notes for our common stock would
dilute stockholder ownership in the Company, and could adversely affect the
market price of our common stock or impair our ability to raise capital through
the sale of additional equity securities. 
Any adjustments to the conversion rate of the Notes would exacerbate
their dilutive effect.

Further, holders of the Notes may request
conversion of the Notes to cash at a time when we need to conserve our cash
reserves, in which event, such conversion may adversely affect us and our
stockholders.

The conversion rights of our convertible preferred
stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock.

We have outstanding 10,000,000 shares of 7.00% series D cumulative
convertible preferred stock (“Series D Preferred Stock”).  The Series D Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain conditions.  At December 31, 2008, the conversion
rate for the Series D Preferred Stock was 0.2479 shares of our common
stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was equivalent to a conversion
price of approximately $100.85 per share of common stock.  The conversion rate for the Series D
Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but
not limited to certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.78 per
share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our
common stock.  In addition, on or after April 20,
2013, we may, at our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D
Preferred Stock to be automatically converted if the closing sale price per
share of our common stock equals or exceeds 150% of the then-applicable
conversion price of the Series D Preferred Stock for at least 20 trading
days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately
prior to our issuance of a press release announcing the exercise of our
conversion option.  Holders of our Series D
Preferred Stock, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time,
convert some or all of their outstanding shares.


The conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock for our
common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in our company, and could
adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our
ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.  Any adjustments to the conversion rates of
the Series D Preferred Stock would exacerbate their dilutive effect.  Further, the conversion rights by the holders
of the Series D Preferred Stock might be triggered in situations where we
need to conserve our cash reserves, in which event, our election, under certain
conditions, to repurchase such Series D Preferred Stock in lieu of
converting them into common stock might adversely affect us and our
stockholders.

We may not be able to sell our properties quickly to raise money.

Investments in real estate are relatively illiquid compared to other
investments.  Accordingly, we may not be
able to sell our properties when we desire or at prices acceptable to us in
response to changes in economic or other conditions.  In addition, the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”) limits our ability to sell
properties held for fewer than two years. 
These limitations on our ability to sell our properties may adversely
affect our cash flows, our ability to repay debt and our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders.

If our revenues are less than our expenses, we may
have to borrow additional funds and we may not be able to make distributions to
our stockholders.

If our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our
operating expenses, including our debt service obligations and capital
expenditures, we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and
cash flow needs.  This could adversely
affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.  Factors that could adversely affect the
revenues we generate from, and the values of, our properties include:

·

national, local and worldwide economic conditions;

·

competition from other life science properties;

·

changes in the life science industry;

·

real estate conditions in our target markets;

·

our ability to collect rent payments;

·

availability of financing;

·

changes to the financial and banking industries;

·

changes in interest rate levels;

·

vacancies at our properties and our ability to
re-lease space;

·

changes in tax or other regulatory laws;

·

the costs of compliance with government regulation;

·

the lack of liquidity of real estate investments; and

·

increases in operating costs.

In addition, if a lease at a property is not a triple net lease, we
will have greater expenses associated with that property and greater exposure
to increases in such expenses. 
Significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes
and insurance and maintenance costs are generally fixed and do not decrease
when revenues at the related property decrease.

Our distributions to stockholders may decline at any time.

We may not continue our current level of distributions to our
stockholders. Our Board of Directors will determine future distributions based
on a number of factors, including:

·

our amount of cash available for distribution;

·

our financial condition;

·

any decision by our Board of Directors to reinvest
funds rather than to distribute such funds;

·

our capital expenditures;

·

the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code; and

·

other factors our Board of Directors deem relevant.

A reduction in distributions to stockholders may negatively impact our
stock price.

Distributions
on our common stock may be made in the form of cash, stock, or a combination of
both.

As a REIT, we are
required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders.
Typically, we generate cash for distributions through our operations, the
disposition of assets, or the incurrence of additional debt. Our Board of
Directors may determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock in
cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common
stock. The Internal Revenue Service recently issued Revenue Procedure 2009-15,
which provides guidance regarding certain dividends payable in cash or stock at
the election of stockholders and declared with respect to taxable years ending
on or before December 31,2009. Under Revenue Procedure 2009-15, a
distribution of our stock pursuant to such an election will be considered a
taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the amount of cash that
could have been received instead if, among other things, 10% or more of the
distribution is payable in cash.  Any such dividend would be distributed
in a manner intended to count toward satisfaction of our annual distribution
requirements and to qualify for the dividends paid deduction.  A reduction
in the cash yield on our common stock may negatively impact our stock price.


We may be unsuccessful with our real estate development activities.

A key component of our long term business consists of the ground-up
development of space for lease. Our success with our development projects
depends on many risks that may adversely affect our business, including those
associated with:

·

unprecedented and extraordinary worldwide negative
economic, financial, and banking conditions;

·

the onset of significant worldwide economic recession
and lack of confidence;

·

the seizure or illiquidity of credit markets;

·

national, local and worldwide economic conditions;

·

delays in construction;

·

budget overruns;

·

lack of availability and/or increasing costs of
materials;

·

commodity pricing of building materials and supplies;

·

financing availability;

·

changes in the life sciences, financial and banking
industries;

·

volatility in interest rates;

·

labor availability and/or strikes;

·

uncertainty of leasing;

·

timing of the commencement of rental payments;

·

changes in local submarket conditions;

·

delays or denials of entitlements or permits; and

·

other property development uncertainties.

In addition, development activities, regardless of
whether they are ultimately successful, typically require a substantial portion
of management’s time and attention.  This
may distract management from focusing on other operational activities.  If we are unable to complete development
projects successfully, our business may be adversely affected.

We have spaces available for redevelopment that may be difficult to
redevelop or successfully lease to tenants.

A key component of our long term business is redevelopment of existing
office, warehouse or shell space as generic laboratory space that can be leased
at higher rates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete
spaces undergoing redevelopment or initiate additional redevelopment
projects.  Redevelopment activities
subject us to many risks, including delays in permitting, financing
availability, engaging contractors, availability and pricing of materials and
labor and other redevelopment uncertainties. 
In addition, there can be no assurance that, upon completion, we will be
able to successfully lease the space or lease the space at rental rates at or
above the returns on our investment anticipated by our stockholders.

Improvements to life science properties are significantly more costly
than traditional office space.

Our properties contain infrastructure improvements that are
significantly more costly than other property types.  Although we have historically been able to
recover the additional investment in infrastructure improvements through higher
rental rates, there is the risk that we will not be able to continue to do so
in the future. Typical improvements include:

·

reinforced concrete floors;

·

upgraded roof loading capacity;

·

increased floor to ceiling heights;

·

heavy-duty heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”)
systems;

·

enhanced environmental control technology;

·

significantly upgraded electrical, gas and plumbing
infrastructure; and

·

laboratory benches.


We may not be able to operate properties
successfully.

Our success depends in large part upon our ability to operate our
properties successfully.  If we are
unable to do so, our business could be adversely affected.  The ownership and operation of real estate is
subject to many risks that may adversely affect our business and our ability to
make payments to our stockholders, including the risks that:

·

our properties may not perform as we expect;

·

we may lease space at rates below our expectations;

·

we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable
terms; and

·

we may underestimate the cost of improvements required
to maintain or improve space up to standards established for the market
position intended for that property.

If we encounter any of these risks, our business
and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely
affected.

We face substantial competition in our target markets.

The significant competition for business in our target markets could
have an adverse effect on our operations. 
We compete for investment opportunities with:

·

insurance companies;

·

pension and investment funds;

·

private equity entities;

·

partnerships;

·

developers;

·

investment companies;

·

other REITs; and

·

owners/occupants.

Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources
than we do and may be able to pay more than we can or accept more risk than we
are willing to accept.  These entities
may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant
or the geographic concentration of their investments.  Competition may also reduce the number of
suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the
bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.

Poor economic conditions in our markets could adversely affect our
business.

Our properties are located in the following markets:

·

California – Los Angeles Metro;

·

California – San Diego;

·

California – San Francisco Bay;

·

Eastern Massachusetts;

·

New Jersey/Suburban Philadelphia;

·

New York City;

·

Southeast;

·

Suburban Washington, D.C.;

·

Washington – Seattle; and

·

International – Canada.


As a result of our geographic concentration, we depend upon the local
economic conditions in these markets, including local real estate
conditions.  We are, therefore, subject
to increased exposure (positive or negative) to economic, tax, currency
fluctuations, and other competitive factors specific to markets in confined
geographic areas.  Our operations may
also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these
markets.  An economic downturn in any of
these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make
distributions to stockholders.  We cannot
assure our stockholders that these markets will continue to grow or will remain
favorable to the life science industry.

We are largely dependent on the life science industry for revenues from
lease payments.

In general, our business and strategy is to invest primarily in
properties used by tenants in the life science industry.  Our business could be adversely affected if
the life science industry is impacted by the current economic, financial and
banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the United States
to other countries.  Because of our
industry focus, events within the life science industry may have a more
pronounced effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders than
if we had more diversified investments. 
Also, some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life
science industry tenant and could require modification before we are able to
re-lease vacant space to another life science industry tenant.  Generally, our properties may not be suitable
for lease to traditional office tenants without significant expenditures on
renovations.

Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases
and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and
the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated
and the increases are proposed.

Our tenants may not be able to pay us if they are
unsuccessful in discovering, developing, making or selling their products and
technologies.

Our life science industry tenants are subject to a number of risks,
including the following, any one or more of which may adversely affect their
ability to make rental payments to us:

·

Some of our tenants developing potential drugs may
find that their drugs are not effective, or may even be harmful, when tested in
humans.

·

Some of our tenants depend on availability of
reimbursements from various government entities or private insurance plans and
reimbursements may decrease in the future.

·

Some of our tenants may not be able to
manufacture their drugs economically, even if such drugs are proven through
human clinical trials to be safe and effective in humans.

·

Drugs that are developed and manufactured by some of
our tenants require regulatory approval, including the approval of the United
States Food and Drug Administration, prior to being made, marketed, sold and
used.  The regulatory approval process to
manufacture and market drugs is costly, typically takes several years, requires
the expenditure of substantial resources and is often unpredictable.  A tenant may fail or experience significant
delays in obtaining these approvals.

·

Some of our tenants and their licensors require
patent, copyright or trade secret protection to develop, make, market and sell
their products and technologies.  A
tenant may be unable to commercialize its products or technologies if patents
covering such products or technologies do not issue, or are successfully
challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented by third parties, or if the
tenant fails to obtain licenses to the discoveries of third parties necessary
to commercialize its products or technologies.

·

A drug made by a tenant may not be well accepted by
doctors and patients, may be less effective or accepted than a competitor’s
drugs, or may be subsequently recalled from the market, even if it is
successfully developed, proven safe and effective in human clinical trials,
manufactured and the requisite regulatory approvals are obtained.

·

Some of our tenants require significant funding to
develop and commercialize their products and technologies, which funding must
be obtained from venture capital firms, private investors, the public markets,
companies in the life science industry or federal, state and local
governments.  Such funding may become
unavailable or difficult to obtain.  The
ability of each tenant to raise


capital will depend on
their financial and operating condition and the overall condition of the
financial, banking and economic environment.

·

Even with sufficient funding, some of our tenants may
not be able to discover or identify potential drug targets in humans, or
potential drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or technologies which are
commercially useful in the discovery or identification of potential drug
targets or drugs.

We cannot assure our stockholders that our tenants will be able to
develop, make, market or sell their products and technologies due to the risks
inherent in the life science industry. 
Any tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks
described above, may have difficulty making rental payments to us.

Our inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as
leases expire may significantly affect our business.

Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and
reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If a tenant experiences a
downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable
to make timely payments under its lease. 
Also, when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate
early, we may not be able to re-lease the space.  Even if tenants decide to renew or lease
space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant
improvements, concessions and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us
than current lease terms.  Consequently,
we could generate less cash flow from the affected properties than expected,
which could negatively impact our business. 
We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet
our debt service payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning
the affected properties.  As of December 31,
2008, leases at our properties representing approximately 9.5% and 10.5% of the
aggregate leased square footage of our properties, excluding month-to-month
leases, were scheduled to expire in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

The inability of a tenant to pay us rent could
adversely affect our business.

Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement
of operating expenses under our leases. 
If our tenants, especially significant tenants, fail to make rental
payments under their leases, our financial condition, cash flow and ability to
make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2008, we had 416 leases with a total of 347
tenants, and 79 of our 159 properties were single-tenant properties.  Our three largest tenants accounted for
approximately 14.3% of our aggregate annualized base rent, or approximately
7.2%, 4.4% and 2.7%, respectively.  “Annualized
base rent” means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31,
2008, using rental revenues calculated on a straight-line basis in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  Annualized base rent does not include
reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and
other operating expenses, substantially all of which are borne by the tenants
in the case of triple net leases.

The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely
affect the income produced by a property. 
If any of our tenants becomes a debtor in a case under the United States
Bankruptcy Code, as amended, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of its
bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court may
authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us.  Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid
future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be
substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant’s
lease.  Any shortfall in rent payments
could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to
our stockholders.

Our

United States

government
tenants may not receive annual budget appropriations, which could adversely
affect their ability to pay us.

United States government tenants may be subject to annual budget
appropriations.  If one of our United
States government tenants fails to receive its annual budget appropriation, it
might not be able to make its lease payments to us.  In addition, defaults under leases with
federal government tenants are governed by federal statute and not by state
eviction or rent deficiency laws.  All of
our leases with United States government tenants provide that the government
tenant may terminate the lease under certain circumstances.  As of December 31, 2008, leases with
United States government tenants at our properties accounted for approximately
2.5% of our aggregate annualized base rent.


We could be held liable for damages resulting from
our tenants’ use of hazardous materials.

Many of our life science industry tenants engage in research and
development activities that involve 
controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and biological and
radioactive compounds.  In the event of
contamination or injury from the use of these hazardous materials, we could be
held liable for damages that result. 
This liability could exceed our resources and any recovery available
through any applicable environmental remediation insurance coverage, and could
adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Together with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state and local
laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and
disposal of hazardous materials and waste products.  Failure to comply with, or changes in, these
laws and regulations could adversely affect our business or our tenants’
businesses and their ability to make rental payments to us.

Our properties may have defects that are unknown to us.

Although we review the physical condition of our properties before they
are acquired, and on a periodic basis after acquisition, any of our properties
may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could adversely
affect the property’s value or revenue potential.

We may incur significant costs complying with the
Americans With Disabilities Act and similar laws.

Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, places of public
accommodation and/or commercial facilities are required to meet federal
requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  We may be required to make substantial
capital expenditures at our properties to comply with this law.  In addition, non-compliance could result in
the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.

A number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations
exist regarding access by disabled persons. 
These regulations may require modifications to our properties or may
affect future renovations.  This may
limit the overall returns on our investments.

We may incur significant costs if we fail to comply with laws or if laws
change.

Our properties are subject to many federal, state and local regulatory
requirements and to state and local fire, life-safety and other
requirements.  If we do not comply with
all of these requirements, we may have to pay fines to government authorities
or damage awards to private litigants. 
We do not know whether these requirements will change or whether new
requirements will be imposed.  Changes in
these regulatory requirements could require us to make significant
unanticipated expenditures.  These
expenditures could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders.

We could incur significant costs complying with environmental laws.

Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations may require
us, as a current or prior owner or operator of real estate, to investigate and
clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products released at or
from any of our properties.  The cost of
investigating and cleaning up contamination could be substantial and could exceed
the amount of any environmental remediation insurance coverage available to
us.  In addition, the presence of
contamination, or the failure to properly clean it up, may adversely affect our
ability to lease or sell an affected property, or to borrow funds using that
property as collateral.

Under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay government
entities or third parties for property damage and for investigation and
clean-up costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties
regardless of whether we knew of or caused the contamination.  Even if more than one party may have been
responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible for all of the
clean-up costs.  In addition, third
parties may sue us for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination
or jointly responsible parties may contest their responsibility or be
financially unable to pay their share of such costs.

Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of
asbestos-containing materials.  These
laws may impose fines and penalties on us for the release of
asbestos-containing materials and may allow third parties to seek recovery from
us for personal injury from exposure to asbestos fibers.  We have detected asbestos-containing
materials at some of our properties, but we do not expect that they will result
in material environmental costs or liabilities to us.


Environmental laws and regulations also require the removal or
upgrading of certain underground storage tanks and regulate:

·

the discharge of storm water, wastewater and any water
pollutants;

·

the emission of air pollutants;

·

the generation, management and disposal of hazardous
or toxic chemicals, substances or wastes; and

·

workplace health and safety.

Many of our tenants
routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at
our properties.  Environmental laws and
regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from
these activities.  Environmental
liabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to
us.  We require our tenants to comply
with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any
related liabilities.

Independent environmental
consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental assessments at all
of our properties.  We intend to use
consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future
acquisitions.  This type of assessment
generally includes a site inspection, interviews and a public records review,
but no subsurface sampling.  These
assessments and certain additional investigations of our properties have not to
date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material
adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

The additional investigations have included, as appropriate:

·

asbestos surveys;

·

radon surveys;

·

lead surveys;

·

mold surveys;

·

additional public records review;

·

subsurface sampling; and

·

other testing.

Nevertheless, it is
possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed, nor that
assessments on future acquisitions will reveal, all environmental
liabilities.  Consequently, there may be
material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware that may result in
substantial costs to us or our tenants and that could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold
or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for
adverse health effects and costs to remedy the problem.

When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on
building materials, mold may grow, particularly if the moisture problem remains
undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time.  Some molds may produce airborne toxins or
irritants.  Indoor air quality issues can
also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or
outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and
bacteria.  Indoor exposure to airborne
toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of
adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other
reactions.  As a result, the presence of
significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could
require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the
mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase
indoor ventilation.  In addition, the
presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to
liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants and others if property
damage or health concerns arise.

We
could incur significant costs due to the financial condition of our insurance
carriers.

We insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have
a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. The financial
condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with
may be negatively impacted resulting in their inability to pay on future
insurance claims. Their inability to pay future claims may have a negative
impact on our financial results. In addition, the failure of one or more
insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or
increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or
redeveloped properties.


Our insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses.

If we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not covered by
insurance or that exceeds our insurance policy limits, we could lose the
capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues from
that property. In addition, we could continue to be obligated on any mortgage
indebtedness or other obligations related to the affected properties.  We carry comprehensive liability, fire,
extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our
properties.  We have obtained earthquake
insurance for our properties because many of them are located in the vicinity
of active earthquake faults.  We also
carry environmental remediation insurance and have title insurance policies on
all of our properties. We obtain our title insurance policies when we acquire
the property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase
price of each property. Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be
in an amount less than the current value of the related property.

Our tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive insurance,
including liability and casualty insurance, that is customarily obtained for
similar properties. There are, however, certain types of losses that we and our
tenants do not generally insure against because they are uninsurable or because
it is not economical to insure against them. 
In the current market, there have recently been substantial increases in
the premium cost of property and liability insurance. The availability of
coverage against certain types of losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold,
has become more limited and, when available, is at a significantly higher
premium cost. We cannot predict whether insurance coverage against terrorism or
toxic mold will remain available for our properties because insurance companies
may no longer offer coverage against such losses or, if offered, such coverage
may become prohibitively expensive. 
Many, but not all, of our properties are low-rise buildings. Toxic mold
has not presented any material problems at any of our properties.

Terrorist attacks may have an adverse impact on our business and
operating results and could decrease the value of our assets.

Terrorist attacks such as those that took place on September 11,
2001, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating
results. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity,
which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties.  To the extent that future terrorist attacks
impact our tenants, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected,
including their ability to continue to honor their lease obligations.

The loss of services of any of our senior executive officers could
adversely affect us.

We depend upon the services of relatively few executive officers.  The loss of services of any one of them may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.  We use the extensive personal and business
relationships that members of our management have developed over time with
owners of life science properties and with major life science industry tenants.  We cannot assure our stockholders that our
senior executive officers will remain employed with us.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be taxed
at corporate rates and would not be able to take certain deductions when
computing our taxable income.

If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify as a REIT:

·

we would be subject to federal income tax on our
taxable income at regular corporate rates;

·

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions
to our stockholders in computing taxable income;

·

unless we were entitled to relief under the Internal
Revenue Code, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the
four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification; and

·

we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue
Code to make any distributions to our stockholders.

As a result of any
additional tax liability, we might need to borrow funds or liquidate certain
investments in order to pay the applicable tax. 
Accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to our stockholders
would be reduced for each of the years involved.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical
and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and
financial results

,

and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.  There are only limited judicial or
administrative interpretations of


these
provisions.  Although we believe that we
have operated in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure our
stockholders that we are or will remain so qualified.

In addition, although we are not aware of any pending tax legislation
that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a REIT, new legislation,
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the
tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT,
or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that
is adverse to our stockholders.

We may change our business policies without stockholder approval.

Our Board of Directors determines all of our material business
policies, with management’s input, including those related to our:

·

status as a REIT;

·

incurrence of debt and debt management activities;

·

selective development, redevelopment and acquisition
activities;

·

stockholder distributions; and

·

other policies, as appropriate.

Our Board of Directors may amend or revise these policies at any time
without a vote of our stockholders. A change in these policies could adversely
affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

There are limits on the ownership of our capital
stock under which a stockholder may lose beneficial ownership of its shares.

The Internal Revenue Code provides that, in order for us to maintain
our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50% of the value of our outstanding
capital stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer
individuals or entities.

In addition, our charter prohibits, with certain limited exceptions,
direct, indirect or constructive ownership of shares of our capital stock
representing more than 9.8% of the combined total value of the outstanding
shares of our capital stock by any person (the “Ownership Limit”).  Our Board of Directors may exempt a
stockholder from the Ownership Limit if, prior to the exemption, our Board of
Directors receives all information it deems necessary to determine or ensure
our status as a REIT.

The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares
of our common stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related
individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or
entity.  A transfer of shares to a person
who, as a result of the transfer, violates the Ownership Limit, may be void or
may be deemed to be made to a trust, for the benefit of one or more qualified
charitable organizations designated by us. 
In that case, the intended transferee will have only a right to share,
to the extent of the transferee’s original purchase price for such shares, in
proceeds from the trust’s sale of those shares.

In addition to the ownership limit, certain provisions of our charter and
bylaws and our stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent transactions that
may be deemed to be desirable to our stockholders.

As authorized by Maryland law, our charter allows our Board of
Directors to cause us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our
common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares
of common or preferred stock without any stockholder approval.  Our Board of Directors could establish a
series of preferred stock that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction that
might involve a premium price for our common stock or for other reasons be
desired by our common stockholders or that have a dividend preference which may
adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.

Our charter permits the removal of a director only upon a two-thirds
vote of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors,
and our bylaws require advance notice of a stockholder’s intention to nominate
directors or to present business for consideration by stockholders at an annual
meeting of our stockholders.  Our charter
and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a
transaction or change in control that involves a premium price for our common
stock or that for other reasons may be desired by our stockholders.


Under our
Stockholder Rights Plan, if a stockholder acquires beneficial ownership of 15%
or more of our common stock, other stockholders would become entitled to
purchase our common stock at half the market price, which would likely result
in substantial dilution to the 15% or greater stockholder.  This may also have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a
premium price for our common stock or for other reasons desired by our common
stockholders.

External
factors may adversely impact the valuation of investments.

We hold equity
investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities
primarily involved in the life science industry.  The valuation of these investments is affected
by many external factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to,
market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable or unfavorable
clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative
agreements.  Unfavorable developments
with respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the
valuation of our investments.

We face risks associated with
short-term liquid investments.

We have significant cash balances that we invest in a
variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value
and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income.  From time to time, these investments may
include (either directly or indirectly) obligations (including certificates of
deposit) of banks, money market funds, Treasury bank securities and other
highly rated short-term securities. 
Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss
of principal.  Under certain
circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of these securities or
funds will be redeemable at par value.  A
decline in the value of our investments or delay or suspension of our right to
redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial condition and our ability to pay our obligations as they become due.

We have certain ownership
interests outside the United States  that
may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our
domestic operations.

We have four operating
properties and one development parcel in Canada and two development parcels in
China.  International development,
ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those
we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations.  These risks include but are not limited to:

·

adverse effects
of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;

·

any
international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange
rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income
test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status
as a REIT;

·

challenges with
respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings;

·

changes in
foreign political, regulatory and economic conditions, including regionally,
nationally, and locally;

·

challenges in
managing international operations;

·

challenges of
complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those
relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment
and legal proceedings;

·

differences in
lending practices;

·

differences in
languages, cultures and time zones; and

·

changes in
applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign
operations.

Although our
international activities currently represent a relatively small portion of our
overall business, these risks could increase in significance which, in turn,
could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial
condition.


We
are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the
United States dollar and foreign currencies.

We have four operating
properties and one development parcel in Canada and two development parcels in
China.  Investments in countries where
the United States dollar is not the local currency are subject to international
currency risk from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the
United States dollar and the local currency. 
A significant decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar, Chinese
Renminbi, or other foreign currencies where we may have a significant
investment could materially affect our results of operations.  We may attempt to mitigate such effects by
borrowing in the local foreign currency in which we invest.  Any international currency gain recognized
with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross
income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order
to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

General

As of December 31,
2008, we had 159 properties containing approximately 11.7 million rentable
square feet of office/laboratory space. 
Excluding properties undergoing redevelopment and properties classified
as “held for sale”, our properties were approximately 94.8% leased as of December 31,
2008.  The exteriors of our properties
typically resemble traditional office properties, but the interior infrastructures
are designed to accommodate the needs of life science industry tenants. These
improvements typically are generic to life science industry tenants rather than
being specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the
improvements have long term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of
life science industry tenants. Generic infrastructure improvements to our life
science properties typically include:

·

reinforced
concrete floors;

·

upgraded roof
loading capacity;

·

increased floor
to ceiling heights;

·

heavy-duty HVAC
systems;

·

enhanced
environmental control technology;

·

significantly
upgraded electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure; and

·

laboratory
benches.

As of December 31, 2008, we held a fee simple interest in each of
our properties, except for 19 properties that accounted for approximately 17%
of the total rentable square footage of our properties. Of the 19 properties,
we held three properties in the San Francisco Bay market, one property in the
Southeast market, two properties in the Suburban Washington, D.C. market and 13
properties in the Eastern Massachusetts market pursuant to ground leasehold
interests. See further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules”.

In addition, as of December 31,
2008, our asset base contained land parcels aggregating to approximately 1.6
million developable square feet in Canada and the New York City and San
Francisco Bay markets which we held pursuant to ground leasehold interests and two
land parcels aggregating approximately 35,000 square meters in China which we
held pursuant to land usage rights.

As of December 31,
2008, we had 416 leases with a total of 347 tenants, and 79 of our 159 properties
were single-tenant properties.  Leases in
our multi-tenant buildings typically have terms of three to seven years, while
the single-tenant building leases typically have initial terms of ten to 20
years. As of December 31, 2008:

·

approximately
89% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases,
requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance,
utilities, common area and other operating expenses (including increases
thereto) in addition to base rent, and, in addition to our triple net leases,
approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required
the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses;

·

approximately
94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective
annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to
3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and

·

approximately
92% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the
recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance
and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing), which we
believe would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.

Our
leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant
alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the
properties remain our property after termination of the lease at our election.
However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that
the tenant, at its expense, remove the improvements and restore the premises to
their original condition.


Location of
properties

The locations of our properties are diversified among a number of life
science markets.  The following table
sets forth, as of December 31, 2008, the total rentable square footage,
annualized base rent and encumbrances of our properties in each of our existing
markets (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Annualized
base rent means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31,
2008 (using rental revenue computed on a straight-line basis in accordance with
GAAP).  Amounts exclude spaces at
properties totaling approximately 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing a
permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment.

(2)

Certain
properties are pledged as security under our secured notes payable as of December 31,
2008.  See Schedule III — Consolidated
Financial Statement Schedule of Rental Properties and Accumulated Depreciation
of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and Subsidiaries in “Item 15.
Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” for additional information on our
properties, including encumbered properties. 
Excludes approximately $145.4 million of encumbrances related to
properties undergoing development or redevelopment, and land held for development.


Redevelopment

A key
component of our business is redevelopment of existing office, warehouse or
shell space as generic laboratory space that can be leased at higher
rates.  As of December 31, 2008, we
had approximately 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing redevelopment at 13
properties.  In addition to properties
undergoing redevelopment, as of December 31, 2008, our asset base
contained embedded opportunities for a future permanent change of use to
office/laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating approximately 1.6
million rentable square feet.

The
following table summarizes total rentable square footage undergoing
redevelopment as of December 31, 2008:

(1)

This
project will be delivered to the tenant for occupancy in February 2009.

(2)

This
project was delivered to the tenant for occupancy in January 2009.

As of December 31,
2008, our estimated cost to complete was approximately $80 per rentable square
foot for the 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use
to office/laboratory space through redevelopment.  Our final costs for these redevelopment
projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including construction
requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations and the amount of costs
funded by each tenant.

There
can be no assurance that we will be able to complete spaces undergoing
redevelopment or initiate additional redevelopment projects.  Redevelopment activities subject us to many
risks, including delays in permitting, financing availability, engaging contractors,
availability and pricing of materials and labor and other redevelopment
uncertainties.  In addition, there can be
no assurance that, upon completion, we will be able to successfully lease the
space or lease the space at rental rates at or above the returns on our
investment anticipated by our stockholders.


Development

Another
key component of our business is ground-up development.  Our development strategy is primarily to
pursue selective projects where we expect to achieve appropriate investment
returns.  We generally have undertaken
ground-up development projects only if our investment in infrastructure will be
substantially made for generic, rather than tenant specific, improvements. As
of December 31, 2008, we had five parcels of land undergoing ground-up
development approximating 875,000 rentable square feet of office/laboratory
space.  In the first quarter of 2009, we
expect to initiate vertical construction of a two-building project aggregating
210,000 rentable square feet located at Mission Bay, San Francisco, Ca.  Pfizer, Inc. has leased 100,000 rentable
square feet and has an option for an additional 50,000 rentable square
feet.  We also have an embedded pipeline
for future ground-up development approximating 9.6 million developable square
feet of office/laboratory space. 
However, new commitments for significant additional ground-up
developments are not strategic priorities in the near term.

The
following table summarizes our properties undergoing ground-up development as
of December 31, 2008:

As of December 31,
2008, our estimated committed costs to complete the 875,000 rentable square
feet undergoing ground-up development was approximately $100 per rentable
square foot.  Our final costs for these
development projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including
construction requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations and the
amount of costs funded by each tenant.

A component of our
business also includes ground-up development projects outside of the United
States. We have the ability to develop up to 924,000 rentable square feet in
Edinburgh, Scotland. We have a right to purchase the land for this development
over the next 13 years. We also have a development site in Toronto, Canada for
the ground-up development of a multi-story building aggregating 770,000
rentable square feet. This parcel is subject to a 99-year ground lease. We also
have two development parcels in China subject to land use rights. One
development parcel is located in South China for a two-building project
aggregating 280,000 rentable square feet. This project is nearing shell
completion. As of December 31, 2008, our estimated remaining costs to
complete shell construction was less than $7 million. The second development
parcel is located in North China for a two-building project aggregating 300,000
rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2008, our estimated remaining
costs to complete shell construction was approximately $18.7 million. Our final
costs for these projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including
construction requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations and the
amount of costs funded by each tenant. 
We do not expect to make any new commitments for significant ground-up
development projects in the near term.


Our success with our
development projects depends on many risks that may adversely affect our business,
including those associated with:

·

unprecedented
and extraordinary worldwide negative economic, financial, and banking
conditions;

·

the onset of
significant worldwide economic recession and lack of confidence;

·

the seizure or
illiquidity of credit markets;

·

national, local
and worldwide economic conditions;

·

delays in
construction;

·

budget overruns;

·

lack of
availability and/or increasing costs of materials;

·

commodity
pricing of building materials and supplies;

·

financing
availability;

·

changes in the
life sciences, financial and banking industries;

·

volatility in
interest rates;

·

labor
availability and/or strikes;

·

uncertainty of
leasing;

·

timing of the
commencement of rental payments;

·

changes in local
submarket conditions;

·

delays or
denials of entitlements or permits; and

·

other property
development uncertainties.

In addition, development
activities, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, typically
require a substantial portion of management’s time and attention.  This may distract management from focusing on
other operational activities.  If we are
unable to complete development projects successfully, our business may be
adversely affected.


Tenants

Our life science
properties are leased principally to a diverse group of tenants, with no tenant
being responsible for more than 7.2% of our annualized base rent.  The following table sets forth information
regarding leases with our 10 largest tenants based upon annualized base rent as
of December 31, 2008:

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

To our knowledge, no
legal proceedings are pending against us, other than routine actions and
administrative proceedings, substantially all of which are expected to be
covered by liability insurance and which, in the aggregate, are not expected to
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY
HOLDERS

We did
not submit any matters to a vote of our security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.


PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is
traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “ARE”. On February 9,
2009, the last reported sales price per share of our common stock was $60.20,
and there were approximately 267 holders of record of our common stock
(excluding beneficial owners whose shares are held in the name of CEDE &
Co.). The following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices
per share of our common stock as reported on the NYSE and the distributions
paid by us with respect to our common stock for each such period:

Future
distributions on our common stock will be determined by and at the discretion
of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon a number of factors,
including actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition and
capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as our Board of
Directors deems relevant.  To maintain
our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to stockholders
of at least 90% of our taxable income for the current taxable year, determined
without regard to deductions for dividends paid and excluding any net capital
gains.  Under certain circumstances, we
may be required to make distributions in excess of cash flow available for
distributions to meet these distribution requirements. In such a case, we may
borrow funds or may raise funds through the issuance of additional debt or
equity capital.  No dividends can be paid
on our common stock unless we have paid full cumulative dividends on our 8.375%
series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”)
and Series D Preferred Stock.  From
the date of issuance of our preferred stock through December 31, 2008, we
have paid full cumulative dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D
Preferred Stock.  We cannot assure our
stockholders that we will make any future distributions.

The
tax treatment of distributions paid in 2008 is as follows: (1) 81.1%
ordinary dividend, (2) 6.6% capital gain at 15%, and (3) 12.3% return
of capital.  The tax treatment of
distributions on common stock paid in 2007 was as follows:  (1) 83.6% ordinary dividend, (2) 10.0%
capital gain at 15%, (3) 5.1% return of capital, and (4) 1.3% Section 1250
capital gain at 25%.

See “Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related
Stockholder Matters” for information on securities authorized for issuance
under equity compensation plans.


ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this
annual report on Form 10-K.  See “Item
15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules”.  Certain amounts for the years prior to 2008
presented in the table below have been reclassified to conform to the
presentation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2008.


(1)

Includes depreciation and amortization on
assets “held for sale” reflected as discontinued operations for the periods
prior to when such assets were classified as “held for sale”.

(2)

Gain/loss on sales of property relates to
eight properties sold during 2008, four properties and four land parcels sold
during 2007, three properties sold during 2006, one property sold during 2005,
and one property sold during 2004. 
Gain/loss on sales of property is included in the consolidated
statements of income in income from discontinued operations, net.

(3)

GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets
utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish
over time.  In an effort to overcome the
difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real
estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) established the measurement tool of
FFO.  Since its introduction, FFO has
become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs.  We believe that FFO is helpful to investors
as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards
established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White
Paper (the “White Paper”) and related implementation guidance, which may differ
from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO is a relevant and widely used
measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an
alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication
of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it
indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding
events, conditions and financial trends that may affect our future plans of
operation, business strategy, results of operations and financial position. A
number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially
from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements,
including, but not limited to, those described below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to
announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements
contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

Overview

We are a publicly traded
REIT focused principally on science-driven cluster formation. We are the
leading provider of high-quality environmentally sustainable real estate,
technical infrastructure services and capital to the broad and diverse life
science industry.  Client tenants include institutional (universities and
independent not-for-profit institutions), pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical,
medical device, product, service, and translational entities, as well as
government agencies.  Our operating platform is based on the principle of “clustering”,
with assets and operations located in key life science markets.

In 2008, we:

·

Executed 141
leases for approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet, up 37% over 2007.

·

Completed
redevelopment of multiple spaces at 14 properties aggregating approximately
335,000 rentable square feet of which approximately 88% was leased.

·

Leased
approximately 630,000 rentable square feet of redevelopment and development
space.

·

Reported operating
margins at approximately 75%.

·

Reported occupancy
at 94.8%.

·

Sold eight
properties for approximately $86 million.

·

Extended
maturities of two secured notes payable aggregating approximately $256 million.

·

Received LEED

®

certifications for two buildings in the
Eastern Massachusetts and San Francisco Bay markets.

·

Closed 7.00%
series D cumulative convertible preferred stock offering with net proceeds of
approximately $242 million.

2008 demonstrated the
strength and durability of our core operations providing office/laboratory
space to the broad and diverse life science industry.  Our operating
results have been steady over the period from our initial public offering in May 1997
through December 31, 2008.  Our core
operating results were solid for 2008, during a period of an extraordinary and
unprecedented United States and worldwide economic, financial, banking and
credit market crises, the onset of a significant worldwide economic recession
and drastic decline in consumer confidence and the consumer driven economy.
Financial systems throughout the world have become illiquid with banks much
less willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers.
Consequently, there is greater uncertainty regarding our ability to access the
credit markets in order to attract financing or capital on reasonable terms or
on any terms.

The current economic, financial and banking environment, worldwide
economic recession and lack of consumer confidence have caused and mandated
significant reductions to our capital expenditures across all areas of our
business, including operating expenses, general and administrative expenses,
development and construction.  We intend
to focus on preservation of capital while maintaining future long term growth
prospects.  We intend to significantly
reduce our capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 while we focus on
the completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating approximately
590,057 rentable square feet and our existing active development projects
aggregating approximately 875,000 rentable square feet. Additionally, we intend
to continue with pre-construction activities for certain land parcels for
future ground-up/vertical above ground development in order to preserve and
create value.  These important
pre-construction activities add significant value to our land for future
ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction
of the buildings.


We also intend to
be very careful and prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to
our active ground-up/vertical developments. 
Future reductions in construction activities will reduce our capital
expenditures.  However, if construction
activities (including pre-construction activities) cease, certain construction
and or pre-construction costs, including interest, taxes, insurance, payroll
and other costs, will be expensed as incurred. 
We also intend to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital
structure over a multi-year period. 
During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt
maturities.   We expect the source of
funds over several years for the repayment of outstanding debt to be provided
by opportunistic sales of real estate, joint ventures and through the issuance
of additional equity securities, as appropriate.  As of December 31, 2008, we had
identified three assets “held for sale” which have been classified in
discontinued operations.

As of December 31,
2008, we had 159 properties containing approximately 11.7 million rentable
square feet of office/laboratory space including approximately 590,057 rentable
square feet of space undergoing a permanent change in use to laboratory space
through redevelopment.  As of that date,
our properties were approximately 94.8% leased, excluding spaces at properties
undergoing redevelopment.  In addition,
as of December 31, 2008, our asset base contained properties undergoing
ground-up development approximating 875,000 rentable square feet.

The following table is a
summary of our properties as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Annualized
base rent means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31,
2008 (using rental revenue computed on a straight-line basis in accordance with
GAAP).  Amounts exclude spaces at
properties totaling approximately 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing a
permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment.

(2)

Including
spaces undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through
redevelopment, occupancy as of December 31, 2008 was approximately 90.0%.

Our primary sources of
revenue are rental income and tenant recoveries (consisting of reimbursement of
real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other
operating expenses from certain tenants) from leases of our properties.  The comparability of financial data from
period to period is affected by the timing of our property development,
redevelopment and acquisition activities. 
Of the 159 properties owned as of December 31, 2008, two were
acquired in 2008 (the “2008 Properties”), 15 in 2007, 19 in 2006, and 104 prior
to 2006.  In addition, we completed the
development of one property in 2007 (together with the 15 properties acquired
in 2007, the “2007 Properties”), four properties in 2006 (together with the 19
properties acquired in 2006, the “2006 Properties”), and 14 properties prior to
2006.  As a result of these development
and acquisition activities, as well as our ongoing redevelopment and leasing
activities, there have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses,
including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for 2008 as
compared to 2007, and for 2007 as compared to 2006.  Our operating expenses generally consist of
real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses.


Leasing

As of December 31,
2008, approximately 89% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were
triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate
taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses,
including increases thereto.  In
addition, as of December 31, 2008, approximately 8% of our leases (on a
rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of
operating expenses.  Additionally, as of December 31,
2008, approximately 92% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis)
provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures and approximately
94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective
annual rent escalations that were either fixed or indexed based on the consumer
price index or another index.

The following table
summarizes information with respect to the lease expirations at our properties
as of December 31, 2008:

(1)

Excludes
14 month-to-month leases for approximately 78,000 rentable square feet.

Our revenues are derived
primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under
our leases. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types
of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely payments under its
lease.  Also, if tenants decide not to
renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to re-lease the
space.  Even if tenants decide to renew
or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any
tenant improvements, concessions and lease commissions, may be less favorable
to us than current lease terms. 
Consequently, we could lose the cash flow from the affected properties,
which could negatively impact our business. 
We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet
our mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the
affected properties.

Redevelopment

A key
component of our long term business is redevelopment of existing office,
warehouse or shell space as generic laboratory space that can be leased at
higher rates.  As of December 31,
2008, we had approximately 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing
redevelopment at 13 properties.  In
addition to properties undergoing redevelopment, as of December 31, 2008,
our asset base contained embedded opportunities for a future permanent change
of use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating
approximately 1.6 million rentable square feet. 
However, new commitments for significant additional redevelopment
projects are not strategic priorities in the near term.  See “Item 2. Properties

— Redevelopment” for a table
summarizing our properties undergoing redevelopment as of December 31,
2008.  As of December 31, 2008, our
estimated cost to complete was approximately $80 per rentable square foot for
the 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use to
office/laboratory space through redevelopment. 
Our final costs for these redevelopment projects will ultimately depend
on many factors, including construction requirements for each tenant, final
lease negotiations and the amount of costs funded by each tenant.


There
can be no assurance that we will be able to complete spaces undergoing
redevelopment or initiate additional redevelopment projects.  Redevelopment activities subject us to many
risks, including delays in permitting, financing availability, engaging
contractors, availability and pricing of materials and labor and other
redevelopment uncertainties.  In
addition, there can be no assurance that, upon completion, we will be able to
successfully lease the space or lease the space at rental rates at or above the
returns on our investment anticipated by our stockholders.

Development

Another
key component of our long term business is ground-up development projects.  Our development strategy is primarily to
pursue selective projects where we expect to achieve appropriate investment
returns.  We generally have undertaken
ground-up development projects only if our investment in infrastructure will be
substantially made for generic, rather than tenant specific, improvements. As
of December 31, 2008, we had five parcels of land undergoing ground-up
development approximating 875,000 rentable square feet of office/laboratory
space.  We also have an embedded pipeline
for future ground-up development approximating 9.6 million developable square
feet of office/laboratory space. 
However, new commitments for significant additional ground-up
developments are not strategic priorities in the near term.  See “Item 2. Properties

— Development” for a table summarizing
our major projects undergoing ground-up development as of December 31,
2008.  As of December 31, 2008, our
estimated committed costs to complete was approximately $100 per rentable
square foot for the 875,000 rentable square feet undergoing ground-up
development.  Our final costs for these
development projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including
construction requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations and the
amount of costs funded by each tenant.

Our success with our
development projects depends on many risks that may adversely affect our
business, including those associated with:

·

unprecedented
and extraordinary worldwide negative economic, financial, and banking
conditions;

·

the onset of
significant worldwide economic recession and lack of confidence;

·

the seizure or
illiquidity of credit markets;

·

national, local
and worldwide economic conditions;

·

delays in
construction;

·

budget overruns;

·

lack of
availability and/or increasing costs of materials;

·

commodity
pricing of building materials and supplies;

·

financing
availability;

·

changes in the
life sciences, financial and banking industries;

·

volatility in
interest rates;

·

labor
availability and/or strikes;

·

uncertainty of
leasing;

·

timing of the
commencement of rental payments;

·

changes in local
submarket conditions;

·

delays or
denials of entitlements or permits; and

·

other property
development uncertainties.

In addition, development
activities, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, typically
require a substantial portion of management’s time and attention.  This may distract management from focusing on
other operational activities.  If we are
unable to complete development projects successfully, our business may be
adversely affected.


Critical accounting policies

Our discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP.  Our significant accounting
policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The preparation of
these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical
experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances.  Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

REIT
compliance

We have elected to be
taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.  Qualification as a REIT involves the
application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.  We believe that our current organization and
method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated
under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to
qualify, as a REIT.  However, it is
possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would
not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us
to fail to qualify.

If we fail to qualify as
a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax
(including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at
regular corporate rates.  If we lose our
REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to
our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved
and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.

Fair value

On January 1, 2008,
we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).  SFAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS 157 applies to reported balances that
are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing
accounting pronouncements.  SFAS 157
establishes and requires disclosure of fair value hierarchy that distinguishes
between data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the
reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions. The
three levels of hierarchy are: 1) using quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities; 2) “significant other observable inputs”; and
3) “significant unobservable inputs”.  “Significant
other observable inputs” can include quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the
asset or liability, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield
curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  “Significant unobservable inputs” are
typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any,
related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value
measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value
hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair
value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its
entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Rental properties, net, properties undergoing
development and redevelopment, and land held for development

In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141”), we allocate the purchase price of acquired
properties to land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant
improvements, equipment, and identified intangibles (including intangible value
to above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships
and other intangible assets) based upon their relative fair values.  The value of tangible assets acquired is
based upon our estimation of value on an “as if vacant” basis.  The value of acquired in-place leases
includes the estimated carrying costs during the hypothetical lease-up period
and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases,
considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place
lease.

We
assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous
factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate
discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a
number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and
market/economic conditions that may affect the property.


The values allocated to
land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and
equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of
20 years for land improvements, the shorter of the term of the respective
ground lease or 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the
respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life for
equipment.  The values of acquired above
and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and
recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for
above market leases) to rental income. 
The values of acquired in-place leases are classified as leasing costs,
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.

Rental properties,
properties undergoing development and redevelopment, land held for development
and intangibles are individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with

Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”),

when conditions
exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future
undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount.  Impairment indicators for our rental
properties, properties undergoing development and redevelopment, and land held
for development are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to,
significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes,
construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates and other market
factors.  We assess the expected
undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited
to, appropriate capitalization rates, construction costs, available market
information, historical operating results, known trends and market/economic
conditions that may affect the property and our assumptions about the use of
the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple
outcomes are under consideration.  Upon
determination that an impairment has occurred and that the future undiscounted
cash flows are less than the carrying amount, a write-down is recorded to
reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value.

Capitalization of costs

As
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, “Capitalization
of Interest Cost” (“SFAS 34”) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67,
“Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects” (“SFAS
67”), we capitalize direct construction and development costs, including
predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs
directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment
or construction of a project.  Pursuant
to SFAS 34 and SFAS 67, capitalization of construction, development and
redevelopment costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an
asset for its intended use.  Costs
incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended
use are expensed as incurred.  Costs
previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development
opportunities are written off.  Should
development, redevelopment or construction activity cease, interest, property
taxes, insurance and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for
capitalization, and would be expensed as incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred.

We also capitalize costs
directly related and essential to our leasing activities.  These costs are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the related leases. 
Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed.

Accounting
for investments

We
hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held
entities primarily involved in the life science industry.  All of our investments in publicly traded
companies are considered “available for sale” in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), and are recorded at
fair value.  Fair value has been
determined based upon the closing trading price as of the balance sheet date,
with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of stockholders’
equity.  The classification of
investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each investment is made,
and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date.  The cost of investments sold is determined by
the specific identification method, with net realized gains included in other
income.

Investments
in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method
because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of the entities
in which we invest.  Certain investments
are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock” and FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46, “Accounting
for Limited Partnership Investments”. Under the equity method of accounting, we
record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the
investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee
subsequent to the date of our investment.

Individual
investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions exist which
may indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these
assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions,
prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product
initiatives and new collaborative agreements. 
For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an
investment below its carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary,
such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash
charge to current earnings. We use “significant other observable inputs” and “significant
unobservable inputs” pursuant to SFAS 157 to determine the fair value of
privately held entities.


Interest
rate swap agreements

We utilize interest rate
swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates
primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan.  These agreements involve an
exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of
the underlying principal amount (the “notional amount”).  Interest received under all of our interest
rate swap agreements is based on the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).  The net difference between the interest paid
and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.

In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”), we record our
interest rate swaps agreements on the balance sheets at their estimated fair
values with an offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized gains/losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.  In accordance with SFAS 157, the fair values
of interest rate swaps are determined using widely accepted valuation
techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows
of each derivative. The analysis reflects the contractual terms of the swaps,
including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs,
including interest rate curves (“significant other observable inputs”).  The fair value calculation also includes an
amount for risk of non-performance using “significant unobservable inputs” such
as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of
default.  We have concluded as of December 31,
2008 that the fair value associated to “significant unobservable inputs” for
risk of non-performance was insignificant to the overall fair value of our
interest rate swaps agreements and as a result, have determined that the
relevant inputs for purposes of calculating the fair value of our interest rate
swap agreements, in their entirety, were based upon “significant other
observable inputs” pursuant to SFAS 157. 
These methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation
of value, and such value may never be realized.

SFAS 133, as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities”, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such as
our interest rate swap agreements.  All
of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly
effective” under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest
rates.  In accordance with SFAS 133, we
formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and
hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk
strategy.  Accordingly, we have
categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  We make an assessment at the inception of
each interest rate swap agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether
these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows
associated with the hedged items.  The
ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately
recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for
such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as “highly effective”, the
changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected
in earnings.

Recognition
of rental income and tenant recoveries

Rental income from leases
with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives and other rent adjustments
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms.  We include amounts currently recognized as
income, and expected to be received in later years, in deferred rent in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years,
are included as unearned rent in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant
security deposits in our consolidated balance sheets.  We commence recognition of rental income at
the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes
possession of or controls the physical use of the property.

Tenant recoveries related
to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and
maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the
period the applicable expenses are incurred.

We maintain an allowance
for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make
payments required under the terms of the lease. 
If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we
may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount
of unpaid rent and unrealized deferred rent. 
As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had no allowance for doubtful
accounts.

Discontinued
operations

We follow the provisions
of SFAS 144 in determining whether a property qualifies as an asset “held for
sale” and should be classified as “discontinued operations”.  A property is classified as “held for sale”
when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management,
having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the
property; (2) the property is available for immediate sale in its present
condition,


subject only to the terms
that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer, and
other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the
sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one
year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that
is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions
necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that
significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be
withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified
as “held for sale”, its operations, including any interest expense directly
attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our
consolidated statements of income and amounts for all prior periods presented
are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations.  A loss is recognized for any initial
adjustment of the asset’s carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in
the period the asset qualifies as “held for sale”.

Depreciation
of assets ceases upon designation of a property as “held for sale”.

Impact of recently issued accounting
standards

In June 2008, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, “Determining Whether
Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating
Securities” (“FSP EITF 03-6-1”).  FSP
EITF 03-6-1 requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or
unpaid) are participating securities and should be included in the computation
of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 applies
to our fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009 and requires that all
prior-period earnings per share data be adjusted retrospectively.  Early adoption is prohibited.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB
14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in
Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (“FSP APB 14-1”) that
affects the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments, such as our
outstanding unsecured convertible notes, that may be settled wholly or
partially in cash.  FSP APB 14-1 requires
that instruments within its scope be separated into their liability and equity
components at

initial recognition by recording
the liability component at the fair value of a similar liability that does not
have an associated equity component and attributing the remaining proceeds from
issuance to the equity component. The excess of the principal amount of the
liability component over its initial fair value will be amortized to interest
expense using the interest method.  In
addition, FSP APB 14-1 requires that the interest cost for our unsecured
convertible notes be accounted for based on our unsecured nonconvertible debt
borrowing rate.  FSP APB 14-1 applies to
our fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009 and requires retrospective
application to all periods presented with early adoption prohibited.  The cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle on periods prior to those presented will be recognized as
of the beginning of the first period presented. An offsetting adjustment will
be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period, presented
separately.  Once adopted, we expect an
increase in our non-cash interest expense associated with our $460 million
aggregate principal amount outstanding of unsecured convertible notes that were
issued in January 2007, including non-cash interest expense for prior
periods (2007 and 2008) as a result of its retrospective application.

The aggregate
retrospective application of both FSP EITF 03-6-1 and FSP APB 14-1 will lower
our reported earnings per share (diluted) by approximately 20 cents for the
year ended December 31, 2008.

In May 2008, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 162, “The
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (“SFAS 162”), the
objective of which is to improve financial reporting by identifying a
consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be
used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with
GAAP for nongovernment entities. Prior to the issuance of SFAS 162, GAAP
hierarchy was defined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(“AICPA”) Statement on Auditing Standards 69, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in
Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (“SAS 69”). SAS 69
has been criticized because it is not directed to the entity, but directed to
the entity’s independent public accountants. SFAS 162 addresses these issues by
establishing that the GAAP hierarchy should be directed to entities because it
is the entity (not its independent public accountants) that is responsible for
selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in
conformity with GAAP. SFAS 162 was effective 60 days following the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s approval on September 16, 2008, of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing amendments to AU Section 411, “The
Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles”. The adoption of SFAS 162 did not have an impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, “Disclosure about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
(“SFAS 161”), to enhance disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging
activities.  SFAS 161 requires that
objectives for using


derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of
underlying risk and accounting designation. 
SFAS 161 requires that the entity disclose the fair value of derivative
instruments and their gains and losses as well as the credit risk related contingent
features. SFAS 161 applies to our fiscal years beginning on January 1,
2009.  The adoption of SFAS 161 is not
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (R), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS
141R”), to create greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting
of business combinations. SFAS 141R requires a company to recognize the assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquired entity to be measured at their fair values as of the acquisition
date.  SFAS 141R also requires companies
to recognize the fair value of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the
acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.  In addition, SFAS 141R requires that
acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from
the business combination and expensed as incurred. SFAS 141R is effective for
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1,
2009.  Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 141R on January 1,
2009 could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we
acquire significant amounts of real estate, as related acquisition costs will
be expensed as incurred compared to our practice prior to adoption of SFAS 141R
of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life
of the assets acquired.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
‘‘Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment
of ARB No. 51’’ (‘‘SFAS 160’’). 
SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated
Financial Statements”, and requires all entities to report noncontrolling
interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial
statements, but separate from the parent shareholders’ equity.  SFAS 160 also requires any acquisitions or
dispositions of noncontrolling interests that do not result in a change of
control to be accounted for as equity transactions.  In addition, SFAS 160 requires that a parent
company recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated upon a change in control. 
SFAS 160 applies to our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2009
and will be adopted prospectively.  The
presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for
all periods presented.  Early adoption is
prohibited.  The adoption of SFAS 160
will result in a reclassification of minority interest to a separate component
of total equity and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest will no
longer be treated as a reduction to net income but will be shown as a reduction
from net income in calculating net income available to common
stockholders.  Additionally, upon
adoption, any future purchase or sale of interest in an entity that results in
a change of control may have a material impact on our financial statements as
our interest in the entity will be recognized at fair value with gains or
losses included in net income.  The
adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact to our diluted
earnings per share.


Results of operations

Comparison
of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31,

Rental revenues increased
by $48.0 million, or 16%, to $348.0 million for 2008 compared to $300.0 million
for 2007.  The increase resulted
primarily from the 2007 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition
of the 2008 Properties.  In addition, in
2008, we recognized additional rental income aggregating $11.3 million
primarily related to a modification of a lease for a property in South San Francisco,
California.

Tenant recoveries
increased by $19.2 million, or 23%, to $101.4 million for 2008 compared to
$82.2 million for 2007.  The increase
resulted primarily from the 2007 Properties being owned for a full year and the
addition of the 2008 Properties.

Other income from 2008
and 2007 of $11.2 million and $14.8 million, respectively represents
construction management fees, interest, investment income and storage
income.  As a percentage of total
revenues, other income for 2008 remained relatively consistent at approximately
2% to 4% of total revenues.

Rental operating expenses
increased by $17.4 million, or 18%, to $114.5 million for 2008 compared to
$97.1 million for 2007.  The increase
resulted primarily from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily
property taxes and utilities) from properties developed, redeveloped and
acquired in 2008 and 2007.  The majority
of the increase in rental operating expenses was recoverable from our tenants.

General and
administrative expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 8%, to $34.8 million for
2008 compared to $32.3 million for 2007, primarily due to the growth in both
the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including
internationally. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative
expenses for 2008 remained consistent with 2007 at approximately 8%.

Interest expense
decreased by $7.3 million, or 9%, to $78.8 million for 2008 compared to $86.1
million for 2007.  The decrease resulted
primarily from a decrease in outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of
credit due to the issuance of 10.0 million shares of our Series D
Preferred Stock in March and April 2008.  Additionally, the decrease resulted from a
decrease in LIBOR rates.  These decreases
were partially offset by increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of
credit.  These borrowings were utilized
to finance the development, redevelopment and acquisition of the 2007
Properties and 2008 Properties.  The
weighted average interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured
term loan, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, decreased
from approximately 5.85% as of December 31, 2007 to approximately 4.30% as
of December 31, 2008.  We have
entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our
exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan (see “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
Interest Rate Swap Agreements”).

Depreciation and
amortization increased by $13.2 million, or 14%, to $108.2 million for 2008
compared to $95.0 million for 2007.  The
increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2007
Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2008 Properties.

During 2008, we
recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $13.3 million associated
with other-than-temporary declines in the value of certain investments below
their carrying value.

Income from discontinued
operations of $15.6 million for 2008 reflects the results of operations of
three properties that were classified as “held for sale” as of December 31,
2008 and eight properties sold during 2008. 
In connection with the properties sold in 2008, we recorded a gain of
approximately $20.4 million.  In accordance
with SFAS 144, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4,650,000 in March 2008
related to an industrial building located in a suburban submarket south of
Boston and an office building located in the San Diego market which has been
included in income from discontinued operations, net.  These properties were sold later in
2008.  Income from discontinued
operations of $10.9 million for 2007 reflects the results of operations of
three properties that were classified as “held for sale” as of December 31,
2008, eight properties sold during 2008, and four properties and four land
parcels sold during 2007.  In connection
with the properties sold in 2007, we recorded a gain of approximately $8.0
million.


Comparison
of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31,

Rental revenues increased
by $70.4 million, or 31%, to $300.0 million for 2007 compared to $229.6 million
for 2006.  The increase resulted
primarily from the 2006 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition
of the 2007 Properties.

Tenant recoveries
increased by $21.6 million, or 36%, to $82.2 million for 2007 compared to $60.6
million for 2006.  The increase resulted
primarily from the 2006 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition
of the 2007 Properties.

Other income increased by
$3.0 million, or 26%, to $14.8 million for 2007 compared to $11.8 million for
2006, due to an overall increase in all sources of other income.  Other income consists of construction
management fees, interest, investment income and storage.

Rental operating expenses
increased by $29.3 million, or 43%, to $97.1 million for 2007 compared to $67.8
million for 2006.  The increase resulted
primarily from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily property
taxes, insurance, and utilities) from properties developed, redeveloped and
acquired in 2007 and 2006.  The majority
of the increase in rental operating expenses is recoverable from our tenants.

General and administrative
expenses increased by $6.3 million or 24%, to $32.3 million for 2007 compared
to $26.0 million for 2006, primarily due to the growth in both the depth and
breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including internationally, from
158 properties with approximately 11.3 million rentable square feet as of December 31,
2006 to 166 properties with approximately 12.2 million rentable square feet as
of December 31, 2007.  As a
percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for 2007 remained
relatively consistent with 2006.

Interest expense
increased by $17.0 million, or 25%, to $86.1 million for 2007 compared to $69.1
million for 2006.  The increase resulted
primarily from increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured
term loan, secured notes payable and outstanding indebtedness related to our
unsecured convertible notes.  These
borrowings were utilized to finance the development, redevelopment, and
acquisition of the 2006 and 2007 Properties. 
We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge a
portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with
our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see “Liquidity and
Capital Resources — Interest Rate Swap Agreements”).

Depreciation and
amortization increased by $24.1 million, or 34%, to $95.0 million for 2007
compared to $70.9 million for 2006.  The
increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2006
Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2007 Properties.

Income
from discontinued operations of $10.9 million for 2007 reflects the results of
operations of three properties that were classified as “held for sale” as of December 31,
2008, eight properties sold during 2008, and four properties and four land
parcels sold during 2007.  In connection
with the properties and land parcels sold in 2007, we recorded a gain of
approximately $8.0 million.  Income from
discontinued operations of $7.4 million for 2006 reflects the results of operations
of three properties that were classified as “held for sale” as of December 31,
2008, eight properties sold during 2008, four properties and four land parcels
sold during 2007, and three properties sold in 2006.  In connection with the properties sold in
2006, we recorded a gain of approximately $59,000.


Liquidity and capital resources

Overview

We expect to continue
meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our
working capital and net cash provided by operating activities.  We believe that the net cash provided by
operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make
distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT.  We also believe that net cash provided by
operating activities will be sufficient to fund recurring non-revenue enhancing
capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.

We expect to meet certain
long term liquidity requirements, such as for property development and
redevelopment activities, scheduled debt maturities, and non-recurring capital
improvements, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset
sales, long term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under
the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, and the issuance of
additional debt and/or equity securities.

Notwithstanding our
expectations, financial markets have recently experienced unusual volatility
and uncertainty. While this condition has occurred initially within the “subprime”
mortgage lending sector of the credit market, financial systems throughout the
world have become illiquid with banks no longer willing to lend substantial
amounts to other banks and borrowers. Consequently, there is greater
uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit market in order to
attract financing or capital on reasonable terms or at any terms. Our ability
to finance our development and redevelopment projects and pending or new
acquisitions, as well as our ability to refinance debt maturities, could be
adversely affected by our inability to secure capital on reasonable terms, if
at all.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We May Not
Be Able to Obtain Additional Capital to Further Our Business Objectives” and “—We
May Not Be Able to Refinance Our Debt”.

The
current extraordinary and unprecedented United States and worldwide economic,
financial, banking and credit market crisis and the onset of a significant
worldwide economic recession and drastic decline in consumer confidence have
caused and mandated significant reductions to of our capital expenditures
across all areas of our business, including operating expenses, general and
administrative expenses and construction. We intend to focus on preservation of
capital while maintaining future growth prospects. We intend to significantly
reduce our capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 while we focus on
the completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating
approximately 590,057 rentable square feet and our existing active development
projects aggregating approximately 875,000 rentable square feet.  Additionally, we intend to continue with
pre-construction activities for certain land parcels for future
ground-up/vertical above ground development in order to preserve and create
value. These important pre-construction activities add significant value to our
land for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate
vertical construction of the buildings. We also intend to be careful and
prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to our active
ground-up/vertical developments. Future reductions in construction activities
will reduce our capital expenditures. 
However, if construction activities (including pre-construction activities)
cease, certain construction and or pre-construction costs, including interest,
taxes, insurance, payroll and other costs, will be expensed as incurred.

We also intend to reduce debt as a
percentage of our overall capital structure over a multi-year period.  During this period, we may also extend and/or
refinance certain debt maturities. We expect the source of funds over several
years for the repayment of outstanding debt to be provided by opportunistic sales
of real estate, joint ventures and through the issuance of additional equity
securities, as appropriate.  As of December 31,
2008, we had identified three assets “held for sale” which have been classified
in discontinued operations.


As
further discussed below, our principal liquidity needs are to:

·

fund normal recurring
expenses;

·

fund current
development and redevelopment costs;

·

fund capital
expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs;

·

fund principal and
interest payments due under our debt obligations, including balloon payments of
principal; and

·

fund dividend
distributions in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal
Revenue Code.

We
believe that our sources of capital for our principal liquidity needs will be
satisfied by:

·

cash on hand of
approximately $71.2 million as of December 31, 2008;

·

restricted cash to fund
certain construction costs;

·

cash flows generated by
operating activities (for the year ended December 31 2008, we generated
approximately $232.7 million of cash flows from operating activities);

·

availability under our
$1.9 billion unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (approximately
$1.4 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2008);

·

cash proceeds from new
secured or unsecured financings;

·

cash proceeds generated
from potential asset sales;

·

cash proceeds from the
issuance of common or preferred equity or debt securities; and

·

cash proceeds from
joint ventures.

Principal liquidity needs

Contractual
obligations and commitments

Contractual
obligations as of December 31, 2008 consisted of the following (in
thousands):

Secured notes payable as
of December 31, 2008 consisted of 29 notes secured by 64 properties and
four land development parcels. Our secured notes payable require monthly
payments of principal and interest and had weighted average interest rates of
approximately 5.26% at December 31, 2008. 
Minority interest share of secured notes payable aggregated
approximately $45.0 million as of December 31, 2008.  The total book values of rental properties,
net and properties undergoing development and redevelopment, and land held for
development securing debt were approximately $1.8 billion at December 31,
2008.  At December 31, 2008, our
secured notes payable were comprised of approximately $785.5 million and $296.4
million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively.

Our
unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010 and may be extended at
our sole option for an additional one year period to October 2011. Our
unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our
sole option for an additional one year period to October 2012.


In January 2007,
we completed a private offering of $460 million of 3.7% unsecured convertible
notes that are due in 2027.  See
additional information under Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements
regarding our ability to redeem these notes, the ability of the holders to
require us to repurchase the notes and circumstances under which the holders
may convert the notes.

Estimated
interest payments on our fixed rate debt and hedged variable rate debt were
calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of
interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates and scheduled maturity
dates. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 74% of our debt was fixed
rate debt or variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements. See
additional information regarding our interest rate swap agreements under “Liquidity
and Capital Resources - Interest Rate Swap Agreements”.  The remaining 26% of our debt is unhedged
variable rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged
variable rate debt have been excluded from the table above because we cannot
reasonably determine the future interest obligations on variable rate debt as
we cannot predict the applicable variable interest rates in the future.  See additional information regarding our debt
under Notes 5, 6, 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Ground
lease obligations as of December 31, 2008 included leases for 19 of our properties
and three land development parcels. 
These lease obligations have remaining lease terms of 24 to 98 years,
excluding extension options.

In addition to the above,
as of December 31, 2008, remaining aggregate costs under contracts for the
construction of properties undergoing development and redevelopment and
infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases approximated $292.2
million.  We expect payments for these
obligations to occur over the next four years, subject to capital planning adjustments
from time to time.  We are also committed
to fund approximately $43.8 million for certain investments over the next six
years.

Capital expenditures, tenant
improvements and leasing costs

As
of December 31, 2008, we had an aggregate of approximately 875,000
rentable square feet undergoing vertical ground-up construction and an
aggregate of approximately 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent
change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment.

For
the years ended

December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, we paid property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements
related to our properties, including expenditures related to our development
and redevelopment projects aggregating approximately $540.8 million, $589.6
million and $274.0 million, respectively. 
These amounts include any payments for property-related capital
expenditures and tenant improvement presented in the table on page 45. We
expect our future property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements
related to our life science properties to decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008.


The following table shows
total and weighted average per square foot property-related capital
expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs (excluding capital
expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants,
revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment)
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

(1)

Property-related
  capital expenditures include all major capital and recurring capital
  expenditures except capital expenditures that are recoverable from tenants,
  revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, or costs related to the redevelopment
  of a property. Major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and
  HVAC systems that are typically identified and considered at the time a
  property is acquired.

(2)

Major
  capital expenditures for 2004 included a one-time HVAC system upgrade at one
  property totaling $1,551,000 or $0.25 per square foot.

(3)

Excludes
  space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting.

Capital expenditures
fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent and timing of
improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our
tenants. Approximately 92% (on a rentable square footage basis) of our leases
provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems
maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot
resurfacing).  In addition, we maintain
an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to
minimize capital expenditures.

Tenant improvements and
leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as
the timing and extent of vacancies; property age; location and characteristics;
the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted space); the involvement of
external leasing agents; and overall competitive market conditions.

We expect our future
capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs, excluding capital
expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants,
revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment,
to be approximately in the range as shown in the table immediately above.


Unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan

We use our unsecured line
of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital, construction
activities and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Our $1.9 billion
unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion unsecured line of credit
and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase
commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $500
million. As of December 31, 2008, we had borrowings of $675 million and
$750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact
of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately 4.30%.

Our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate
based on our election of either (1) a LIBOR-based rate plus 1.00% to 1.45%
depending on our leverage or (2) the higher of a rate based upon Bank of
America’s prime rate plus 0.0% to 0.25% depending on our leverage or the
Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%.  For each
LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six
months. Our unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010 and may be
extended at our sole option for an additional one year period to October 2011.
Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our
sole option for an additional one year period to October 2012.

Our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan contain financial covenants, including, among
others, the following (as defined under the terms of the agreement):

·

leverage
ratio less than 65.0%;

·

fixed
charge coverage ratio greater than 1.40;

·

minimum
book value of $800 million; and

·

secured
debt ratio less than 55%.

As of December 31,
2008, we believe our two most restrictive financial covenants under our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan are the leverage and fixed
charge ratios.  Future changes in
interest rates, our outstanding debt balances and other changes in our
business, operations or financial statements may result in a default of these
and other financial covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured
term loan.

In addition, the
terms of the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict, among
other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions, mergers and
borrowings available under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
for developments, land and encumbered assets. 
As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we were in compliance with all
such covenants.

Aggregate
unsecured borrowings may be limited to an amount based primarily on the net
operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties and our cost
basis of development assets and land. 
Aggregate unsecured borrowings may increase as we complete the
development, redevelopment, or acquisition of additional unencumbered
properties.  As of December 31,
2008, aggregate unsecured borrowings were limited to approximately $2.5
billion. If net operating income from properties supporting our borrowing
capacity under our unsecured credit facilities decreases, our borrowing
capacity under our credit facilities will also decrease. Additionally, we may
be required to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in
order to maintain compliance with one or more covenants under our credit
facilities.

As of December 31,
2008, we had approximately 50 lenders providing commitments under our $1.9
billion unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. During 2008, all
lenders under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan funded
borrowings requested under these agreements. In the future, if one or more of
the lenders under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan fail to
fund a borrowing request, we may not be able to borrow funds necessary for
working capital, construction activities, dividend payments, debt repayment and
monthly debt service and other recurring capital requirements. The failure of
one or more lenders to fund their share of a borrowing request may have a
material impact on our financial statements.

We have risks
associated with the maturity of our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan. There may be fewer, if any, lenders willing to participate in future
unsecured credit facilities and future commitments from lenders may be lower
than existing commitments.  In addition,
key terms and covenants may be less favorable than existing key terms and
covenants and we may not be able to raise capital to repay our outstanding
balance on our unsecured credit facilities prior to or at maturity.

Interest rate
swap agreements

We utilize interest rate
swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates
primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan.  These agreements involve an exchange
of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the
underlying principal amount (the “notional amount”).  Interest received under all of our interest
rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid
and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.


The following table
summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2008
(dollars in thousands):

We have entered into
master derivative agreements with each counterparty.  These master derivative agreements (all of
which are adapted from standard International Swaps & Derivatives
Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between us and each counterparty
to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap agreements. In
order to limit our risk of nonperformance of an individual counterparty under
our interest rate swap agreements, our interest rate swap agreements are spread
among various counterparties. As of December 31, 2008, the largest
aggregate notional amount with an individual counterparty was $175
million.  If one or more of our
counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate swap agreements, we will
have risk of higher interest costs associated with our variable rate
LIBOR-based debt.

As of December 31,
2008 and 2007, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in accounts
payable, accrued expenses, tenant security deposits and other assets at their
fair values aggregating a liability balance of approximately $80.5 million and
$26.9 million, respectively, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as
unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
equity.  Balances in accumulated other
comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap payments are made.  During the next 12 months, we expect to
reclassify approximately $33.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive
income to interest expense as an increase to interest expense.

Secured notes payable

As of December 31,
2008, we had aggregate secured notes payable of approximately $1.1 billion. If
we are unable to refinance, extend principal payments due at maturity or pay
principal maturities with proceeds from other capital sources, then our cash
flows may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay
debt upon maturity. Furthermore, even if we are able to refinance debt prior to
maturity, the interest rate, loan to value, and other key loan terms may be
less favorable than existing loan terms. 
Less favorable loan terms, assuming we are


able to refinance our
secured notes payable, may result in higher interest costs, additional required
capital as a result of less proceeds or lower loan to value upon refinancing,
and new or more restrictive covenants or loan terms.

Dividends

We are required to
distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to
continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not
contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred and
common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities.  All such distributions are at the discretion
of our board of directors.  We may be
required to use borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, if necessary, to
meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status.  We consider market factors and our
performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution
levels.  During the year ended December 31,
2008, we paid dividends on our common stock aggregating approximately $101.4
million.  During the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid dividends
on our Series C Preferred Stock aggregating approximately $10.9 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid dividends on our Series D
Preferred Stock aggregating approximately $9.7 million.

Sources of capital

Cash and cash equivalents

As
of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $71.2 million of cash and cash

equivalents

.

Tenant security
deposits and other restricted cash

Tenant security deposits
and other restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):

The
funds held in escrow related to construction projects will be used to pay for
certain construction costs.

Cash flows

Net cash provided by
operating activities for 2008 increased by $63.0 million to $232.7 million
compared to $169.7 million for 2007.  The
increase resulted primarily from an increase in cash flows from operations and
cash flows from overall changes in operating assets and liabilities.

We believe our cash
flows from operating activities provide a stable source of cash to fund
operating expenses.  In addition, as of December 31,
2008,

approximately 89% of our leases (on a rentable
square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and
other operating expenses, including increases thereto and approximately 8% of
our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a
majority of operating expenses.

We are largely dependent
on the life science industry for revenues due under lease agreements.  Our business could be adversely affected if
the life science industry is impacted by the current economic downturn and
financial and banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the
United States to other countries.  Our
tenants may not be able to pay amounts due under their lease agreements if they
are unsuccessful in discovering, developing, making or selling their products
or technologies.

The bankruptcy or
insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a
property.  If any of our tenants becomes
a debtor in a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict
that tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. 
The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate
its lease with us.  Our claim against
such a tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation
that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us
under the tenant’s lease.  Any shortfall
in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders.


Net cash used in
investing activities for 2008 was $467.5 million compared to $931.3 million for
2007. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due
to a lower amount of acquisition of properties.

Net cash provided by
financing activities for 2008 decreased by $468.8 million to $298.0 million
compared to $766.7 million for 2007.  For
the year ended December 31, 2008, proceeds from the issuance of Series D
Preferred Stock, secured notes payable, and borrowings from our unsecured line
of credit of approximately $1.3 billion were offset by principal reductions of
secured notes payable and our unsecured line of credit of approximately $919.5
million.  Additionally, for the year
ended December 31, 2008, we paid dividends on our common and preferred
stock of approximately $101.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively.  We also redeemed minority interests on two of
our properties for approximately $1.3 million during the year ended December 31,
2008.  For the year ended December 31,
2007, proceeds from secured notes payable, unsecured convertible notes,
borrowings from our unsecured line of credit, and issuance of common stock of
approximately $2.1 billion were reduced by the redemption payments on our 9.10%
cumulative redeemable series B preferred stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”),
principal reductions of secured notes payable, and our unsecured line of credit
of approximately $1.2 billion. Additionally, for the year ended December 31,
2007, we paid dividends on our common and preferred stock of approximately
$90.0 million and $12.7 million, respectively.

Unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan

We use our unsecured line
of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital, construction
activities and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Our $1.9 billion
unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion unsecured line of credit
and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase
commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $500
million. As of December 31, 2008, we had borrowings of $675 million and
$750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact
of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately 4.30%.  See additional information regarding our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan on page 46.

Property dispositions

During the year ended December 31,
2008, we sold eight properties at an aggregate contract price of approximately
$86.3 million. The net sales proceeds were initially used to repay outstanding
secured debt related to the properties sold or outstanding debt on our
unsecured line of credit. As of December 31, 2008, we had three properties
classified as “held for sale”.

Other resources
and liquidity requirements

Under our current shelf
registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we
may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt and other securities.  These securities may be issued from time to
time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions.

In March 2008, we
completed a public offering of 8,800,000 shares of Series D Preferred
Stock.  The shares were issued at a price
of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $213
million (after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering
costs).  In April 2008, we sold an additional
1,200,000 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock in an exercise of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option, resulting in aggregate proceeds of
approximately $29 million (after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other
offering costs).  The proceeds from this
offering were used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of
credit.  The dividends on our Series D
Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original
issuance.  We pay dividends quarterly in
arrears at an annual rate of $1.75 per share. 
Our Series D Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject
to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions and we are not allowed
to redeem our Series D Preferred Stock, except to preserve our status as a
REIT.  Investors in our Series D
Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights.  On or after April 20, 2013, we may, at
our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D Preferred Stock
to be automatically converted if the closing sale price per share of our common
stock equals or exceeds 150% of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series D
Preferred Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to our issuance of a press
release announcing the exercise of our conversion option.  Holders of our Series D Preferred Stock,
at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of
their outstanding shares initially at a conversion rate of 0.2477 shares of
common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately $100.93 per share of common
stock.  The conversion rate for the Series D
Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but
not limited to certain dividends on our


common stock in excess of
$0.78 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares
of our common stock.  As of December 31,
2008, the Series D Preferred Stock had a conversion rate of approximately
0.2479 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $100.85 per share of common
stock.

In September 2007, we
sold 2,300,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including
the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option).  The shares were issued at a
price of $96.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately
$215 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs).

In February 2007, we
called for redemption of our Series B Preferred Stock.  The Series B Preferred Stock was
redeemed in March 2007 at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share
plus $0.4107639 per share representing accumulated and unpaid dividends to the
redemption date.  In accordance with FASB
Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, “The Effect on the Calculation of
Earnings Per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock”,
we recorded a charge of approximately $2,799,000 to net income available to
common stockholders for costs related to the redemption of the Series B
Preferred Stock.

In January 2007, we
completed a private offering of $460 million of the Notes that are due in 2027
with a coupon of 3.70%.  The net proceeds
from this offering, after underwriters’ discount, were approximately $450.8
million. Prior to January 15, 2012, we will not have the right to redeem
the Notes, except to preserve our qualification as a REIT.  On and after that date, we have the right to
redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for
cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus
any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.  Holders of the Notes may require us to
repurchase their Notes, in whole or in part, on January 15, 2012, 2017 and
2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be
purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase
date.  At issuance, the Notes had an
initial conversion rate of approximately 8.4774 common shares per $1,000
principal amount of the Notes representing a conversion price of approximately
$117.96 per share of our common stock. 
This initial conversion price represented a premium of 20% based on the
last reported sale price of $98.30 per share of our common stock on January 10,
2007.  The conversion rate of the Notes
is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to,
certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.74 per share per quarter
and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2008, the Notes had a
conversion rate of approximately 8.5070 common shares per $1,000 principal
amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately
$117.55 per share of our common stock. 
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes into cash and, if
applicable, shares of our common stock prior to the stated maturity of the
Notes only under the following circumstances: 
(1) the Notes will be convertible during any calendar quarter after
the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2007, if the closing sale price of
our common stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately
preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price in effect on
the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) the
Notes will be convertible during the five consecutive business days immediately
after any five consecutive trading day period (the “Note Measurement Period”)
in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was
equal to or less than 98% of the average conversion value of the Notes during
the Note Measurement Period; (3) the Notes will be convertible upon the
occurrence of specified corporate transactions, including a change in control,
certain merger or consolidation transactions or the liquidation of the Company;
(4) the Notes will be convertible if we call the Notes for redemption; and
(5) the Notes will be convertible at any time from, and including, December 15,
2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15,
2027 or earlier redemption or repurchase. 
The Note Measurement Period is the five

consecutive
trading day period following a request by a holder of the Notes to convert his
Notes.

We hold interests, together
with certain third parties, in a limited partnership and in limited liability
companies which we consolidate in our financial statements. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, these third parties contributed equity
aggregating approximately $1.1 million for their interest in these entities
primarily related to their share of funds for construction related activities.


Off-balance sheet arrangements

As
of December 31, 2008, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Exposure
to environmental liabilities

In connection with the
acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental
assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or
other issues.  The Phase I environmental
assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities
that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental
liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were
completed.  In addition, we carry a
policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain
environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

Inflation

As of December 31,
2008, approximately 89% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were
triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate
taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses,
including increases thereto.  In
addition, as of December 31, 2008, approximately 8% of our leases (on a
rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of
operating expenses. Approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square
footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either
fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer
price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings
or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk
from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase
in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including borrowings related to
our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan.


Funds from operations

GAAP basis accounting for
real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate
values diminish over time.  In an effort
to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost
accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of NAREIT established
the measurement tool of FFO.  Since its
introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among
REITs.  We believe that FFO is helpful to
investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards
established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White
Paper (the “White Paper”) and related implementation guidance, which may differ
from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO is a relevant and widely used
measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an
alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication
of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it
indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to
make distributions (see “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — Cash Flows” above
for information regarding these measures of cash flow).

The following table
presents a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to
funds from operations available to common stockholders (in thousands):

(1)

Includes
  depreciation and amortization on assets “held for sale” reflected as
  discontinued operations (for the periods prior to when such assets were
  classified as “held for sale”).

(2)

Gain
  on sales of property relates to eight properties sold during 2008 and four
  properties and four land parcels sold during 2007. Gain on sales of property
  is included in the consolidated statements of income in income from
  discontinued operations, net.


ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the
exposure to losses resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices.

Interest rate risk

The primary market risk
to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from
many factors, including government monetary and tax policies, domestic and
international economic and political considerations and other factors that are
beyond our control.

In order to modify and
manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt and to limit
the effects of interest rate risks on our operations, we may utilize a variety
of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other
interest rate exchange contracts.  The
use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes
in interest rates carries additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk
and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts.

Our future earnings and
fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon
prevalent market rates of interest, such as LIBOR. However, our interest rate
swap agreements are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate
changes.  Based on interest rates at, and
our interest rate swap agreements in effect on, December 31, 2008 and
2007, we estimate that a 1% increase in interest rates on our variable rate
debt, including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, after
considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements, would decrease
annual future earnings by approximately $3.6 million and $4.0 million,
respectively.  We further estimate that a
1% decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt, including our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, after considering the effect
of our interest rate swap agreements in effect on December 31, 2008 and
2007, would increase annual future earnings by approximately $3.6 million and
$4.0 million, respectively.  A 1%
increase in interest rates on our secured debt, unsecured convertible notes and
interest rate swap agreements would decrease their aggregate fair values by
approximately $60.9 million and $71.3 million at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively.  A 1% decrease in
interest rates on our secured debt, unsecured convertible notes and interest
rate swap agreements would increase their aggregate fair values by
approximately $63.0 million and $74.9 million at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

These amounts were
determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our
borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements in effect on December 31,
2008 and 2007.  These analyses do not
consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that
could exist in such an environment. 
Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would consider
taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to
the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure.

Equity
price risk

We have exposure to
equity price market risk because of our equity investments in certain publicly
traded companies and privately held entities. 
We classify investments in publicly traded companies as “available for
sale” and, consequently, record them on our consolidated balance sheets at fair
value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income or loss. 
Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under
the cost method because we do not influence any of the operating or financial
policies of the entities in which we invest. 
For all investments, we recognize other-than-temporary declines in value
against earnings in the same period the decline in value was deemed to have
occurred.  There is no assurance that
future declines in value will not have a material adverse impact on our future
results of operations.  By way of
example, a 10% decrease in the fair value of our equity investments as of December 31,
2008 and 2007 would decrease their fair values by approximately $6.2 million
and $8.4 million, respectively.


Foreign
currency risk

We have exposure to
foreign currency exchange rate market risk related to our subsidiaries
operating in Canada and China.  The
functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries operating in Canada and China
are the respective local currencies. 
Gains or losses resulting from the translation of our foreign
subsidiaries’ balance sheets and income statements are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’
equity.  Gains or losses will be
reflected in our income statement when there is a sale or partial sale of our
investment in these operations or upon a complete or substantially complete
liquidation of the investment. Based on our current operating assets outside
the United States as of December 31, 2008, we estimate
that a 10% increase in foreign currency rates relative to the United
States dollar would increase annual future earnings by approximately
$778,000.  We further estimate that a 10% decrease in foreign
currency rates relative to the United States dollar would decrease annual
future earnings by approximately $778,000.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Changes in internal
control over financial reporting

There
have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 that could materially
affect, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Evaluation of disclosure
controls and procedures

As of December 31,
2008, we performed an evaluation, under the supervision of our Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These controls and procedures have been
designed to ensure that information required for disclosure is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods.  Based on our evaluation, the CEO and CFO
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
2008.


Management’s
annual report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and
Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and effected by the Company’s board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
GAAP.  The Company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of
the Company’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.  In making its assessment, management has
utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”)
of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”.
Management concluded that based on its assessment, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2008.  The effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited
by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.


Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders of

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

We have audited
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”)
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO
criteria”). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based
on the COSO criteria.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, and our
report dated February 12, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders of

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008.  Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements
and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Alexandria Real Estate
Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated February 12, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Background

References to the “Company”,
“we”, “our” and “us” refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and
its subsidiaries.

Alexandria Real Estate
Equities, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in
1994.  We are focused principally
on science-driven cluster formation through the ownership, operation,
management and selective redevelopment, development and acquisition
of properties containing office/laboratory space.  Our properties are designed and improved for
lease primarily to institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit
institutions), pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, medical device, product,
service, and translational entities, as well as government agencies. As of December 31,
2008, we had 159 properties (155 properties located in ten states in the United
States and four properties located in Canada) containing approximately 11.7
million rentable square feet (including spaces undergoing active redevelopment),
compared to 166 properties (162 properties located in ten states in the United
States and four properties located in Canada) with approximately 12.1 million
rentable square feet (including spaces undergoing active redevelopment) as of December 31,
2007.

As of December 31,
2008, approximately 89% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were
triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes
and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including increases
thereto.  In addition, as of December 31,
2008, approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis)
required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2008,
approximately 92% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided
for the recapture of certain capital expenditures and approximately 94% of our
leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent
escalations that were either fixed or based on the consumer price index or
another index.  Any references to the
number of buildings, square footage, number of leases and occupancy in the
notes to consolidated financial statements are unaudited.

Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alexandria Real
Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

We hold interests,
together with certain third parties, in a limited partnership and in limited
liability companies which we consolidate in our financial statements. Such
interests are subject to provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN46R”), FASB Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 96-16, “Investor’s Accounting for an Investee When
the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder
or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights”, FASB Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 04-5, “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the
General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity
When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” and AICPA Statement of Position
78-9, “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures”.  Based on the provisions set forth in these
rules, we consolidate the limited partnership and limited liability companies
because we exercise significant control over major decisions by these entities,
such as investment activity and changes in financing.  For entities that are variable interest
entities (“VIE”), as defined under FIN 46R, we consolidate the entity if we are
the primary beneficiary.

Use of estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Fair value

On January 1, 2008,
we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).  SFAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS 157 applies to reported balances that
are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting
pronouncements.  SFAS 157 establishes and
requires disclosure of fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between data
obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting
entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions. The three levels
of hierarchy are: 1) using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities; 2) “significant other observable inputs”; and 3) “significant
unobservable inputs”.  “Significant other
observable inputs” can include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or
liability, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that
are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 
“Significant unobservable inputs” are typically based on an entity’s own
assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances
where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from
different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy
within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value
measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to
the asset or liability.

The carrying amounts of
cash and cash equivalents, tenant security deposits and other restricted cash,
tenant receivables and accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security
deposits approximate fair value.  As
described in Note 8, our interest rate swap agreements have been recorded at
fair value.

The fair value of our
secured notes payable, unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and
unsecured convertible notes was estimated using “significant other observable
inputs” such as available market information and discounted cash flows analyses
based on borrowing rates we believe we could obtain with similar terms and
maturities.  As of December 31, 2008
and 2007, the aggregate fair values of our secured notes payable, unsecured
line of credit, unsecured term loan and unsecured convertible notes were
approximately $2,696,566,000 and $2,783,549,000, respectively.

Operating segment

We are engaged in the
business of providing office/laboratory space for lease to the life science
industry.  Our properties are similar in
that they provide space for lease to the life science industry, consist of
office/laboratory improvements that are generic and reusable for the life science
industry, are located in key life science cluster markets and have similar
economic characteristics. Our chief operating decision maker, as defined under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”, reviews financial
information for our entire consolidated operations when making decisions on how
to allocate resources and in assessment of our operating performance.  The financial information disclosed herein
represents all of the financial information related to our principal operating
segment.

International operations

The functional currency
for our subsidiaries operating in the United States is the United States
dollar.  We have four operating
properties and one development parcel in Canada and two development parcels in
China.  The functional currency for our
foreign subsidiaries operating in Canada and China is the local currency.  The assets and liabilities of our foreign
subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in
effect as of the financial statement date. 
Income statement accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated
using the average exchange rate for the period presented.  Gains or losses resulting from the
translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity.

(continued)

International operations (continued)

The appropriate amounts
of foreign exchange gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive
income will be reflected in income when there is a sale or partial sale of our
investment in these operations or upon a complete or substantially complete
liquidation of the investment.

Rental properties, net, properties undergoing development and
redevelopment, and land held for development and discontinued operations

In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141”), we allocate the purchase price of acquired
properties to land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant
improvements, equipment, and identified intangibles (including intangible value
to above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships
and other intangible assets) based upon their relative fair values.  The value of tangible assets acquired is
based upon our estimation of value on an “as if vacant” basis.  The value of acquired in-place leases
includes the estimated carrying costs during the hypothetical lease-up period
and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases,
considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place
lease.

We
assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous
factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate
discount and capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a
number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and
market/economic conditions that may affect the property.

The values allocated to
land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and
equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of
20 years for land improvements, the shorter of the term of the respective
ground lease on 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the
respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life for
equipment.  The values of acquired above
and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and
recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for
above market leases) to rental income. 
The values of acquired in-place leases are classified as leasing costs,
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.

In accordance with SFAS
141, the values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over
the terms of the related leases and recorded as either an increase (for below
market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income.  For the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, we recognized a net increase in rental income of approximately
$9,509,000, $7,572,000 and $8,497,000, respectively, for the amortization of
acquired above and below market leases. The value of acquired leases, less
accumulated amortization, was approximately $37,194,000 and $46,703,000 as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively.  The
weighted average amortization period of acquired leases was approximately 3.8
years as of December 31, 2008.  The
estimated aggregate annual amortization of acquired leases for each of the five
succeeding years is approximately $9,931,000 for 2009, $6,311,000 for 2010,
$4,269,000 for 2011, $3,088,000 for 2012 and $3,041,000 for 2013.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost” (“SFAS 34”) and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67, “Accounting for Costs
and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects” (“SFAS 67”), we
capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment
costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and
essential to the acquisition, development or construction of a project.  Pursuant to SFAS 34 and SFAS 67,
capitalization of construction, development and redevelopment costs is required
while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use.  Costs incurred after a project is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as
incurred.  Costs previously capitalized
related to abandoned acquisitions or development opportunities are written
off.  Should development, redevelopment
or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance and certain
costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as
incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred.

In accordance with SFAS 144, we

classify a property as “held for sale” when all of the following criteria for a
plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to
approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the
property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only
to the terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate
a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been
initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be
completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for
sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions
necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that
significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be
withdrawn.  When all of these criteria
have been met, the property is classified as “held for sale”, its operations,
including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as
discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income and amounts
for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to
discontinued operations.  A loss is
recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset’s carrying amount to fair
value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as “held for sale”.

Depreciation of assets ceases upon
designation of a property as “held for sale”.

Rental properties, net,
properties undergoing development and redevelopment, and land held for
development and discontinued operations (continued)

Rental properties, properties undergoing development and redevelopment,
land held for development and intangibles are individually evaluated for impairment
in accordance with

Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”),

when
conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of
expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount.  Impairment indicators for our rental
properties, properties undergoing development and redevelopment, and land held
for development are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to,
significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes,
construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates and other market
factors.  We assess the expected
undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited
to, appropriate capitalization rates, construction costs, available market
information, historical operating results, known trends and market/economic
conditions that may affect the property and our assumptions about the use of
the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple
outcomes are under consideration.  Upon
determination that an impairment has occurred and that the future undiscounted
cash flows are less than the carrying amount, a write-down is recorded to
reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value.  Based upon our evaluation, we recognized a
non-cash impairment charge

on properties “held for
sale”

of approximately $4,650,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2008, related to an industrial building located in a suburban
submarket south of Boston and an office building located in the San Diego
market, and is included in income from discontinued operations, net on the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Conditional asset retirement
obligations

Some of our properties
may contain asbestos which, under certain conditions, requires
remediation.  Although we believe that the asbestos is appropriately
contained in accordance with environmental regulations, our practice is to
remediate the asbestos upon the development or redevelopment of the affected
property.  In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting
for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an

Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”), we
recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement
obligation (including asbestos) when the fair value of the liability can be
reasonably estimated.  In addition, for certain properties, we have not
recognized an asset retirement obligation when there is an indeterminate
settlement date for the obligation because the period in which we may remediate
the obligation may not be estimated with any level of precision to provide for
a meaningful estimate of the retirement obligation. Conditional asset
retirement obligations totaled approximately $10.9 million and $10.8 million as
of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are included in accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and cash equivalents

We consider all highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when
purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. 
The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at major
commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit of $250,000.  We have
not experienced any losses to date on our invested cash.

Tenant security deposits and other restricted cash

Tenant security deposits
and other restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):

Investments

We hold equity
investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities
primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in
publicly traded companies are considered “available for sale” in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), and are
recorded at fair value pursuant to SFAS 157. 
Fair value has been determined based upon the closing trading price as
of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses

F-9

(continued)

Investments (continued)

shown as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity.  The
classification of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each
investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet
date.  The cost of investments sold is
determined by the specific identification method, with net realized gains and
losses included in other income. Investments in privately held entities are
generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any
operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest.  Certain investments are accounted for under
the equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,
“The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock” (“APB 18”)
and FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46, “Accounting for Limited
Partnership Investments” (“EITF Topic D-46”). 
Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment
initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize
our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of
our investment.  As of December 31,
2008 and 2007, our ownership percentages in the voting stock of each individual
privately held entity was under 10%.

Individual investments
are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions exist which may
indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these
assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions,
available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial
results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements. If there are
no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an adverse
effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate its fair value. For
all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below
its carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary, such investment is
written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current
earnings. We use “significant other observable inputs” and “significant
unobservable inputs” pursuant to SFAS 157 to determine the fair value of
privately held entities.

Leasing costs

Costs directly related
and essential to our leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the related lease.  Costs related to unsuccessful leasing
opportunities are expensed.  Leasing
costs, net of related amortization, totaled approximately $60,147,000 and
$51,819,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The value of acquired
in-place leases, recorded pursuant

to SFAS 141, are included in amounts immediately above and are
classified as leasing costs, included in other assets in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining term of the
related lease.  The value of acquired
in-place leases, net of related amortization, was approximately $12,184,000 and
$17,868,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The estimated annual amortization of the
value

of acquired in-place leases for
each of the five succeeding years is approximately $3,686,000 for 2009,
$2,764,000 for 2010, $1,740,000 for 2011, $1,118,000 for 2012 and $941,000 for
2013.

Loan fees and costs

Fees and costs incurred
in obtaining long term financing are amortized over the terms of the related
loans and included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.  Loan fees and costs,
net of related amortization, totaled approximately $21,662,000 and $27,477,000
as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are included in other
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Interest rate swap agreements

We utilize interest rate
swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates
primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan.  These agreements involve an
exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of
the underlying principal amount (the “notional amount”).  Interest received under all of our interest
rate swap agreements is based on the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”).  The net difference between
the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to
interest expense.

F-10

2.
Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies
(continued)

Interest rate swap agreements (continued)

In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”), we record our
interest rate swaps agreements on the balance sheets at their estimated fair
values with an offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized gains/losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.  In accordance with SFAS 157, the fair values
of interest rate swaps are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques
including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each
derivative. The analysis reflects the contractual terms of the swaps, including
the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including
interest rate curves (“significant other observable inputs”).  The fair value calculation also includes an
amount for risk of non-performance using “significant unobservable inputs” such
as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of
default.  We have concluded as of December 31,
2008 that the fair value associated to “significant unobservable inputs” for
risk of non-performance was insignificant to the overall fair value of our
interest rate swaps agreements and as a result, have determined that the relevant
inputs for purposes of calculating the fair value of our interest rate swap
agreements, in their entirety, were based upon “significant other observable
inputs” pursuant to SFAS 157.  These
methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and
such value may never be realized.

SFAS 133, as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities”, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such as
our interest rate swap agreements.  All
of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly
effective” under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest
rates.  In accordance with SFAS 133, we
formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and
hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk
strategy.  Accordingly, we have
categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  We make an assessment at the inception of
each interest rate swap agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether
these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows
associated with the hedged items.  The
ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately
recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for
such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as “highly effective”, the
changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected
in earnings.

Accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits

As of December 31,
2008, accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits included
accounts

payable
and accrued expenses of approximately $86,171,000, swap liability of
$80,542,000, accrued construction of $73,470,000 and acquired below market
leases of approximately $37,194,000. As of December 31, 2007, accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits included accounts payable
and accrued expenses of approximately $48,785,000, swap liability of
$27,144,000, accrued construction of $25,296,000 and acquired below market
leases of approximately $46,703,000.

Accumulated other comprehensive
income

Accumulated
other comprehensive income consisted of the following (in thousands):

Rental income and tenant recoveries

Rental income from leases
with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives and other rent adjustments
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms.  We include amounts currently recognized as
income, and expected to be received in later years, in deferred rent in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years,
are included as unearned rent in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant
security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  We commence recognition of rental income at
the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes

Rental income and tenant recoveries (continued)

possession of or controls
the physical use of the property.  Tenant
recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities,
repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue
in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.

We maintain an allowance
for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make
required payments.  If a tenant fails to
make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad
debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and
unrealized deferred rent.  As of December 31,
2008 and 2007, we had no allowance for doubtful accounts.

Interest income

Interest income was
approximately $1,763,000, $1,916,000 and $1,303,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, and is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.

Income taxes

We are organized and
qualify as a REIT pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”).  Under the Code, a REIT
which distributes 100% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and
which meets certain other conditions is not subject to federal income taxes,
but could be subject to certain state and local taxes.  We generally distribute 100% or more of our
taxable income.  Therefore, no provision
for Federal income taxes is required.  We
file tax returns, including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal, state
and local jurisdictions, including jurisdictions located in the United States,
Canada, China and other international locations.  Our tax returns are subject to examination in
various jurisdictions for the calendar years 2004 through 2008.

In accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), the tax benefit of
uncertain tax positions is recognized only if it is “more likely than not” that
the tax position will be sustained, based solely on its technical merits, with
the taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. The
measurement of a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that meets the “more
likely than not” threshold is based on a cumulative probability model under
which the largest amount of tax benefit recognized is the amount with a greater
than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing
authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. As of December 31,
2008, there were no unrecognized tax benefits. We do not anticipate a
significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the
next 12 months.

Interest expense and
penalties, if any, would be recognized in the first period the interest or
penalty would begin accruing according to the provisions of the relevant tax
law at the applicable statutory rate of interest. We did not incur any tax
related interest expense or penalties for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 or 2006.

During the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, we declared dividends on our common stock of $3.18, $3.04
and $2.86 per share, respectively. 
During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we
declared dividends on our series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock (“Series B
Preferred Stock”) of $0, $0.4108 and $2.275 per share, respectively.  During the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, we declared dividends on our series C cumulative
redeemable preferred stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”) of $2.09375,
$2.09375 and $2.09375 per share, respectively. 
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we declared dividends on
our series D cumulative convertible preferred stock (“Series D Preferred
Stock”) of $1.409722.  See Note 12,
Preferred Stock and Excess Stock.

The tax treatment of
distributions paid in 2008 is as follows: (1) 81.1% ordinary dividend, (2) 6.6%
capital gain at 15%, and (3) 12.3% return of capital.  The tax treatment of distributions on common
stock paid in 2007 is as follows: (1) 83.6% ordinary dividend; (2) 10.0%
capital gain at 15%; (3) 5.1% return of capital; and (4) 1.3% Section 1250
capital gain at 25%.  The information

Earnings per share, dividends declared and preferred stock redemption
charge

The following table shows
the computation of earnings per share, and dividends declared per common share:

Our calculation of
weighted average diluted shares pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, “Earnings Per Share” will include additional shares
related to our unsecured convertible notes when the average market price is
above the current conversion price. The number of additional shares that will
be included in the weighted average diluted shares is equal to the number of
shares that would be issued upon the settlement of the unsecured convertible
notes assuming the settlement occurred on the end of the reporting period. For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average common
stock equivalents related to our unsecured convertible notes have been excluded
from diluted weighted average shares of common stock as our unsecured
convertible notes were not convertible as of December 31, 2008.

The dilutive effect of
our series D convertible preferred stock will be reflected in diluted earnings
per share by application of the “if-converted” method in accordance with SFAS
128.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2008, the weighted average common stock equivalents related to our series D
convertible preferred stock have been excluded from diluted weighted average
shares of common stock as the impact on diluted earnings per share was
anti-dilutive.

FASB Emerging Issues Task
Force Topic D-42, “The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings Per Share for the
Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock” (“EITF Topic D-42”)
provides, among other things, that any excess of (1) the fair value of the
consideration transferred to the holders of preferred stock redeemed over (2) the
carrying amount of the preferred stock, should be subtracted from net earnings
to determine net income available to common stockholders in the calculation of
earnings per share.  The cost to issue
our preferred stock was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital
in the period that the preferred stock was issued.  Upon any redemption of our preferred stock,
the respective offering costs, representing the excess of the fair value of the
consideration transferred to the holders over the carrying amount of the
preferred stock, will be recognized as a dividend to preferred stockholders.  During 2007, we recorded a charge of
approximately $2,799,000 to net income available to common stockholders for
costs related to the redemption of our Series B Preferred Stock.  Dividends on preferred stock are deducted
from net income to arrive at net income allocable to common stockholders.

Stock-based compensation expense

Effective January 1,
2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”). Under the modified-prospective
transition method of SFAS 123R, compensation cost is recognized over the
remaining service period for the portion of outstanding stock options as of January 1,
2006, for which the requisite service had not been rendered. The compensation
cost is based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. In addition, SFAS
123R requires that we account for an estimate of awards that are expected to
vest and to revise the estimate for actual forfeitures. The adoption of SFAS
123R did not

have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements since all awards accounted for under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees” (“APB 25”) were fully vested prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R.
Effective January 1, 2003, we had adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock- Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”) prospectively to all
employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003. We
have not granted any stock options since 2002.

Impact of recently issued
accounting standards

In June 2008, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, “Determining Whether
Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating
Securities” (“FSP EITF 03-6-1”).  FSP
EITF 03-6-1 requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or
unpaid) are participating securities and should be included in the computation
of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 applies
to our fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009 and requires that all
prior-period earnings per share data be adjusted retrospectively.  Early adoption is prohibited.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB
14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in
Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (“FSP APB 14-1”) that
affects the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments, such as our
outstanding unsecured convertible notes, that may be settled wholly or
partially in cash.  FSP APB 14-1 requires
that instruments within its scope be separated into their liability and equity
components at

initial recognition by recording
the liability component at the fair value of a similar liability that does not
have an associated equity component and attributing the remaining proceeds from
issuance to the equity component. The excess of the principal amount of the
liability component over its initial fair value will be amortized to interest
expense using the interest method.  In
addition, FSP APB 14-1 requires that the interest cost for our unsecured
convertible notes be accounted for based on our unsecured nonconvertible debt
borrowing rate.  FSP APB 14-1 applies to
our fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009 and requires retrospective
application to all periods presented with early adoption prohibited.  The cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle on periods prior to those presented will be recognized as
of the beginning of the first period presented. An offsetting adjustment will
be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period, presented
separately.  Once adopted, we expect an
increase in our non-cash interest expense associated with our $460 million
aggregate principal amount outstanding of unsecured convertible notes that were
issued in January 2007, including non-cash interest expense for prior
periods (2007 and 2008) as a result of its retrospective application.

The aggregate
retrospective application of both FSP EITF 03-6-1 and FSP APB 14-1 will lower
our reported diluted earnings per share by 20 cents for the year ended December 31,
2008.

In May 2008, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 162, “The
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (“SFAS 162”), the
objective of which is to improve financial reporting by identifying a
consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be
used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with
GAAP for nongovernment entities. Prior to the issuance of SFAS 162, GAAP
hierarchy was defined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(“AICPA”) Statement on Auditing Standards 69, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in
Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (“SAS 69”). SAS 69
has been criticized because it is not directed to the entity, but directed to
the entity’s independent public accountants. SFAS 162 addresses these issues by
establishing that the GAAP hierarchy should be directed to entities because it
is the entity (not its independent public accountants) that is responsible for
selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in
conformity with GAAP. SFAS 162 was effective

and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Impact of recently issued accounting standards
(continued)

60 days following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval on September 16,
2008, of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing amendments to
AU Section 411, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”. The adoption of SFAS 162 did not
have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, “Disclosure about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
(“SFAS 161”), to enhance disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging
activities.  SFAS 161 requires that
objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying
risk and accounting designation.  SFAS
161 requires that the entity disclose the fair value of derivative instruments
and their gains and losses as well as the credit risk related contingent
features. SFAS 161 applies to our fiscal years beginning on January 1,
2009.  The adoption of SFAS 161 is not
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141 (R), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”),
to create greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of
business combinations. SFAS 141R requires a company to recognize the assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquired entity to be measured at their fair values as of the acquisition
date.  SFAS 141R also requires companies
to recognize the fair value of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the
acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.  In addition, SFAS 141R requires that acquisition-related
costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the business
combination and expensed as incurred. SFAS 141R is effective for business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1,
2009.  Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 141R on January 1,
2009 could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we
acquire significant amounts of real estate, as related acquisition costs will
be expensed as incurred compared to our practice prior to adoption of SFAS 141R
of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life
of the assets acquired.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
‘‘Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment
of ARB No. 51’’ (‘‘SFAS 160’’). 
SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated
Financial Statements”, and requires all entities to report noncontrolling
interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial
statements, but separate from the parent shareholders’ equity.  SFAS 160 also requires any acquisitions or
dispositions of noncontrolling interests that do not result in a change of
control to be accounted for as equity transactions.  In addition, SFAS 160 requires that a parent
company recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated upon a change in control. 
SFAS 160 applies to our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2009
and will be adopted prospectively.  The
presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for
all periods presented.  Early adoption is
prohibited.  The adoption of SFAS 160
will result in a reclassification of minority interest to a separate component
of total equity and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest will no
longer be treated as a reduction to net income but will be shown as a reduction
from net income in calculating net income available to common
stockholders.  Additionally, upon
adoption, any future purchase or sale of interest in an entity that results in
a change of control may have a material impact on our financial statements as
our interest in the entity will be recognized at fair value with gains or
losses included in net income.  The
adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact to diluted
earnings per share.

3. Rental properties, net, properties undergoing
development and redevelopment, and land held for development

Rental properties, net consisted of the following (in thousands):

As of December 31,
2008 and 2007, certain of our rental properties were encumbered by deeds of
trust and assignments of rents and leases associated with the properties. See
Note 5, Secured Notes Payable.  The net
book values of encumbered rental properties as of December 31, 2008 and
2007 were approximately $1,323,912,000 and $1,489,994,000, respectively.

We lease space under noncancelable leases with remaining terms of up to
15 years.

In July 2006, we
completed the acquisition of a 90% equity interest in the leasehold interest in
10.4 acres commonly known as Technology Square (“Tech Square”) at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (“MIT”) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The remaining 10%
equity interest was retained by MIT.  MIT
is also a tenant at Tech Square occupying approximately 178,952 rentable square
feet as of December 31, 2008. The results of Tech Square’s operations have
been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. Tech
Square consists of a seven building campus (including a 1,593-space covered car
parking garage and a 49-space surface parking lot) containing approximately 1.2
million rentable square feet and is subject to a ground lease with an affiliate
of MIT through December 31, 2064.

In accordance with SFAS
141, in July 2006, we allocated the purchase price of Tech Square based
upon the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
including rental properties of approximately $616 million, other assets of approximately
$5 million, secured notes payable of approximately $220 million, acquired below
market leases of approximately $26 million and minority interest of
approximately $37 million. The weighted average amortization period related to
the acquired below market leases was approximately six years at the time of
acquisition.

Our financial statements,
on an unaudited pro forma basis, for the acquisition of Tech Square, the
issuance of 2.5 million shares of common stock with proceeds of approximately
$232 million and borrowings on our unsecured line of credit of approximately
$106 million as if it had occurred on January 1, 2006, would have
reflected total consolidated revenues of approximately $347.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006.  Net
income available to common stockholders would have been approximately $60.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Net income available to common stockholders
on a diluted per share basis would have been $2.21 for the year ended December 31,
2006.  All other properties acquired
during 2006 comprise a series of individually insignificant unrelated
transactions, both individually and in aggregate, and have been excluded from
this pro forma analysis.

As of December 31,
2008 and 2007, we had approximately $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion,
respectively, undergoing development, redevelopment and pre-construction
activities.  In accordance with SFAS 34,
we are required to capitalize interest during the period an asset is undergoing
activities to prepare it for its intended use. 
Capitalization of interest ceases after a project is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use. 
In addition, should construction activity cease, interest would be
expensed as incurred.  Total interest
capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
approximately $72,580,000, $56,036,000 and $35,282,000, respectively. Total
interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
approximately $151,800,000, $142,806,000 and $105,359,000, respectively.

development and redevelopment, and land held for development (continued)

Minimum lease payments to be received under the terms of the operating
lease agreements, excluding expense reimbursements, as of December 31,
2008 are as follows (in thousands):

4. 
Investments

We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and
privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of
our investments in publicly traded companies are considered “available for sale”
in accordance with SFAS 115, and are recorded at fair value pursuant to SFAS
157.  Fair value of our investments in
publicly traded companies has been determined based upon the closing trading
price as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. 
The classification of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the
time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each
balance sheet date.  The cost of
investments sold is determined by the specific identification method, with net
realized gains and losses included in other income.  Investments in privately held entities are
generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any
operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest.  Certain investments are accounted for under
the equity method in accordance with APB 18 and EITF Topic D-46.  As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our
ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual privately held
entity was under 10%.  For all our
investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying
value is determined to be other-than-temporary, such investment is written down
to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings.  The factors that we consider in making these
assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions,
available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial
results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements.  As a result of these assessments, in 2008, we
recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $13,251,000, respectively
for other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of investments, including
$1,985,000 that was recognized in March 2008.

The following table summarizes our “available for sale” securities (in
thousands):

Investments in “available
for sale” securities with gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2007
had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months.  We had the ability and intent to hold these
investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a recovery of our
investment.  We believe that these
unrealized losses were temporary and accordingly we did not recognize an other-than-temporary
impairment related to “available for sale” securities as of December 31,
2007.

F-17

4. 
Investments (continued)

Our investments in
privately held entities as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 totaled
approximately $55,502,000 and $56,126,000, respectively.  Of these totals, approximately $55,478,000
and $55,841,000 are accounted for under the cost method.  The remainder

($24,000
and $285,000 for 2008 and 2007, respectively) are accounted for under the
equity method in accordance with APB 18 and EITF Topic D-46.  As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, there
were no unrealized losses in our investments in privately held entities.

Net investment income of
approximately $8,005,000, $11,700,000, and $7,138,000 was recognized in 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in other income in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
Net investment income in 2008 consisted of equity in loss of approximately
$173,000 related to investments in privately held entities accounted for under
the equity method, gross realized gains of approximately $8,841,000 and gross
realized losses of approximately $663,000. 
For the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $10,816,000 was
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to realized gains, net
and is included in other income. Net investment income in 2007 consisted of
equity in loss of approximately $330,000 related to investments in privately
held entities accounted for under the equity method, gross realized gains of
approximately $12,216,000 and gross realized losses of approximately
$186,000.  Net investment income in 2006
consisted of equity in loss of approximately $632,000 related to investments in
privately held entities accounted for under the equity method, gross realized
gains of approximately $8,305,000 and gross realized losses of approximately
$535,000.

5.
Secured notes payable

Secured notes payable totaled approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2
billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our secured notes
payable had weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.26% and 6.08% at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from
June 2009 to August 2016.

Our secured notes payable generally require monthly payments of
principal and interest.  The total net
book values of rental properties, net, properties undergoing development and
redevelopment, and land held for development securing debt were approximately
$1.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007.  At December 31, 2008, our secured notes
payable were comprised of approximately $785.5 million and $296.4 million of
fixed and variable rate debt, respectively, compared to approximately $902.9
million and $310.0 million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively, at December 31,
2007.

Future principal payments
due on secured notes payable as of December 31, 2008, are as follows
(dollars in thousands):

(1)

The weighted average
interest rate related to payments on our secured notes payable is calculated
based upon the outstanding debt as of December 31st of the year
immediately preceding the year presented.

(2)

Includes
minority interests’ share of scheduled principal maturities of approximately
$45.0 million, of which approximately $23.0 million and $20.8 million mature in
2009 and thereafter, respectively.

Total

secured notes payable
as of December 31, 2008 is net of unamortized discount of approximately
$2.1 million.

F-18

6.  Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan

Our $1.9 billion unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion
unsecured line of credit and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the
future elect to increase commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by
up to an additional $500 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had
borrowings of $675 million and $750 million outstanding under our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan, respectively, with a weighted average
interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, of
approximately 4.30%.

Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, as amended, bear
interest at a floating rate based on our election of either (1) a
LIBOR-based rate plus 1.00% to 1.45% depending on our leverage or (2) the
higher of a rate based upon Bank of America’s (“BofA”) prime rate plus 0.0% to
0.25% depending on our leverage or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%.  For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a
LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months. Our unsecured line of credit
matures in October 2010 and may be extended at our sole option for an
additional one year period to October 2011. Our unsecured term loan
matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our sole option for an
additional one year period to October 2012.

Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial
covenants, including, among others, the following (as defined under the terms
of the agreement):

·

leverage ratio less than 65.0%;

·

fixed charge coverage ratio greater than
1.40;

·

minimum book value of $800 million; and

·

secured debt ratio less than 55%.

In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan restrict, among other things, certain investments,
indebtedness, distributions, mergers and borrowings available under our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan for developments, land and
encumbered assets.  As of December 31,
2008 and 2007, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

Aggregate unsecured borrowings may be limited to an amount based
primarily on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered
properties and our cost basis of development assets and land.  Aggregate unsecured borrowings may increase as
we complete the development, redevelopment or acquisition of additional
unencumbered properties.  As of December 31,
2008, aggregate unsecured borrowings were limited to approximately $2.5
billion.

7.  Unsecured convertible notes

In January 2007, we completed a private offering of $460 million
of unsecured convertible notes that are due in 2027 (the “Notes”) with a coupon
of 3.70%.  The net proceeds from this
offering, after underwriters’ discount, were approximately $450.8 million.  Prior to January 15, 2012, we will not
have the right to redeem the Notes, except to preserve our qualification as a
REIT.  On and after that date, we have
the right to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time
to time, for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be
redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
redemption date.  Holders of the Notes
may require us to repurchase their Notes, in whole or in part, on January 15,
2012, 2017 and 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the
repurchase date.

At issuance, the Notes had an initial conversion rate of approximately
8.4774 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes representing a
conversion price of approximately $117.96 per share of our common stock.  This initial conversion price represented a
premium of 20% based on the last reported sale price of $98.30 per share of our
common stock on January 10, 2007. 
The conversion rate of the Notes is subject to adjustments for certain
events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common stock in
excess of $0.74 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable
in shares of our common stock.  As of December 31,
2008, the Notes had a conversion rate of approximately 8.5070 common shares per
$1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price
of approximately $117.55 per share of our common stock.

F-19

7.  Unsecured convertible notes (continued)

Holders of the Notes may convert
their Notes into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock prior to
the stated maturity of the Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) the
Notes will be convertible during any calendar quarter after the calendar
quarter ending March 31, 2007, if the closing sale price of our common
stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading
days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar
quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day
of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) the Notes will be
convertible during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five
consecutive trading day period (the “Note Measurement Period”) in which the
average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was equal to or less
than 98% of the average conversion value of the Notes during the Note
Measurement Period; (3) the Notes will be convertible upon the occurrence
of specified corporate transactions, including a change in control, certain
merger or consolidation transactions or the liquidation of the Company; (4) the
Notes will be convertible if we call the Notes for redemption; and (5) the
Notes will be convertible at any time from, and including, December 15,
2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15,
2027 or earlier redemption or repurchase. 
The Note Measurement Period is the five

consecutive
trading day period following a request by a holder of the Notes to convert his
Notes.

8. Interest rate swap
agreements

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our
exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan. 
These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the “notional
amount”).  Interest received under all of
our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid
and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.

SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards
for derivative financial instruments such as our interest rate swap
agreements.  All of our interest rate
swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly effective” under SFAS
133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates.  In accordance with SFAS 133, we formally
document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and hedged
items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy.  Accordingly, we have categorized these
instruments as cash flow hedges.  We make
an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement and on an
ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items.  The ineffective portion of each interest rate
swap agreement is immediately recognized in earnings.  While we intend to continue to meet the
conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as “highly
effective”, the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges
would be reflected in earnings.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our interest rate swap
agreements were classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, tenant
security deposits and other assets at their fair values aggregating a liability
balance of approximately $80.5 million and $26.9 million, respectively, with
the offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. 
Balances in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in
earnings as swap payments are made.  For
the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $14.9 million was
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as
an increase to interest expense.  During
the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify approximately $33.2 million from
accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as an increase to
interest expense.

Interest rate swap agreements (continued)

The following table
summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2008
(dollars in thousands):

In accordance with SFAS
133, we record our interest rate swaps agreements on the balance sheets at
their estimated fair values with an offsetting adjustment reflected as
unrealized gains/losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity.  In accordance with
SFAS 157, the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using widely
accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the
expected cash flows of each derivative. The analysis reflects the contractual
terms of the swaps, including the period to maturity, and uses observable
market-based inputs, including interest rate curves (“significant other
observable inputs”).  The fair value
calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using “significant
unobservable inputs” such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate
the likelihood of default.  We have
concluded as of December 31, 2008, the fair value associated to “significant
unobservable inputs” for risk of non-performance was insignificant to the
overall fair value of our interest rate swaps agreements and as a result, have
determined that the relevant inputs for purposes of calculating the fair value
of our interest rate swap agreements, in their entirety, were based upon “significant
other observable inputs” pursuant to SFAS 157.

Commitments and contingencies

Employee retirement savings plan

We have a retirement
savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
whereby our employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to their
respective retirement accounts, in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowed
under the Internal Revenue Code.  In
addition to employee contributions, we have elected to provide discretionary
profit sharing contributions (subject to statutory limitations), which amounted
to approximately $1,289,000, $941,000, and $850,000, respectively, for the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Employees who participate in
the plan are immediately vested in their contributions and in the contributions
of the company.

Commitments and contingencies (continued)

Concentration of credit risk

We maintain our cash and
cash equivalents at insured financial institutions.  The combined account balances at each
institution periodically exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)
insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk

related
to amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.

We are dependent on
rental income from relatively few tenants in the life science industry.  The inability of any single tenant to make
its lease payments could adversely affect our operations.  As of December 31, 2008, we held 416
leases with a total of 347 tenants and 79 of our 159 properties were each
leased to a single tenant.  At December 31,
2008, our three largest tenants accounted for approximately 14.3% of our
aggregate annualized base rent.

We generally do not
require collateral or other security from our tenants, other than security
deposits.  In addition to security
deposits held in cash, we held approximately $60.9 million in irrevocable
letters of credit available from certain tenants as security deposits for 164
leases as of December 31, 2008.

Commitments

As of December 31,
2008, remaining aggregate costs under contracts for the construction of
properties undergoing development and redevelopment and infrastructure
improvements under the terms of leases approximated $292.2 million.  We expect payments for these obligations to
occur over the next 4 years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time
to time.  We were also committed to fund
approximately $43.8 million for certain investments over the next six years.

As of December 31,
2008, we were committed under the terms of ground leases for 19 of our properties
and three land development parcels. 
These lease obligations over the next five years and thereafter are
approximately $6.1 million in 2009, $6.6 million in 2010, $7.7 million in 2011,
$8.2 million in 2012 and $8.7 million in 2013 and $559.4 million thereafter,
and have remaining lease terms of 24 to 98 years, exclusive of extension
options.  In addition, as of December 31,
2008, we were committed under the terms of certain operating leases for our
headquarters and field offices.  These
lease obligations totaling approximately $4.6 million have remaining lease
terms of less than one year to four years, exclusive of extension options.

10.  Minority interest

Minority interest
represents the third party interests in certain entities in which we have a controlling
interest and a third party interest in a VIE in which we are the primary
beneficiary.  These entities own eight
properties and three development parcels and are included in our consolidated
financial statements.  Minority interest
is adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to minority holders and
the minority holders’ proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each
respective entity.

Minority interest is adjusted for additional
contributions, distributions to minority holders and the minority holders’
proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective
entity.  Distributions, profits and
losses related to these entities are allocated in accordance with the
respective operating agreements.

As
of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we were the primary beneficiary of a VIE
which owns a development parcel with a carrying value of approximately $88.0
million and $72.8 million, respectively. 
The development parcel serves as collateral for a non-recourse secured
loan that had balances of approximately $50.7 million and $38.2 million at December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively, and matures in June 2009.  We may, in certain circumstances, be
obligated to provide additional capital to the VIE in accordance with the
operating agreement.  As of December 31,
2008 and 2007, the minority interest balance related to this entity was
approximately $15.3 million.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the aggregate
minority interest balance was approximately $75.0 million and $75.5 million,
respectively, and is classified as minority interest in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.

11.  Issuances of common stock

In September 2007, we sold
2,300,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including the
shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option).  The shares were issued at a price of $96.00
per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $215 million (after
deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs).

12.  Preferred stock and excess stock

Series B cumulative
redeemable preferred stock

In January 2002, we
completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of our 9.10% series B
cumulative redeemable preferred stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”)
(including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment
option).   The shares were issued at a
price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately
$55.1 million (after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering
costs).   The dividends on our Series B
Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of issuance.  We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an
annual rate of $2.275 per share.  Our Series B
Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or
mandatory redemption and is not redeemable prior to January 22, 2007,
except in order to preserve our status as a REIT.  Investors in our Series B Preferred
Stock generally have no voting rights.

In February 2007, we
called for redemption of our Series B Preferred Stock.  The Series B Preferred Stock was
redeemed in March 2007 at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share
plus $0.4107639 per share representing accumulated and unpaid dividends to the
redemption date.  In accordance with EITF
Topic D-42, we recorded a charge of approximately $2,799,000 to net income
available to common stockholders for costs related to the redemption of the Series B
Preferred Stock.

Series C cumulative
redeemable preferred stock

In June 2004, we
completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our 8.375% series C
cumulative redeemable preferred stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”)
(including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option).  The shares were issued at a
price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately
$124.0 million (after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering
costs).  The proceeds were used to redeem
our series A preferred stock with the remaining portion used to pay down our
unsecured line of credit.  The dividends
on our Series C Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of
original issuance.  We pay dividends
quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of $2.09375 per share.  Our Series C Preferred Stock has no
stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and
is not redeemable prior to June 29, 2009, except in order to preserve our
status as a REIT.  Investors in our Series C
Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights.  On or after June 29, 2009, we may, at
our option, redeem our Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at
any time for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and
unpaid dividends.

Series D cumulative
convertible preferred stock

In March 2008, we
completed a public offering of 8,800,000 shares of our 7.00% series D
cumulative convertible preferred stock (“Series D Preferred Stock”).  The shares were issued at a price of $25.00
per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $213 million (after
deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering costs).  In April 2008, we sold an additional
1,200,000 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock in an exercise of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option, resulting in aggregate proceeds of
approximately $29 million (after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other
offering costs).  The proceeds from this
offering were used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of
credit.  The dividends on our Series D
Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original
issuance.  We pay dividends quarterly in
arrears at an annual rate of $1.75 per share. 
Our Series D Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject
to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions and we are not allowed
to redeem our Series D Preferred Stock, except to preserve our status as a
REIT.  Investors in our Series D
Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights.  On or after April 20, 2013, we may, at
our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D Preferred Stock
to be automatically converted if the closing sale price per share of our common
stock equals or exceeds 150% of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series D
Preferred Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to our issuance of a
press release announcing the exercise of our conversion option.  Holders of our Series D Preferred Stock,
at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of
their outstanding shares initially at a conversion rate of 0.2477 shares of
common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately $100.93 per share of common
stock.  The conversion rate for the Series D
Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but
not limited to certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.78 per
share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our
common stock.  As of December 31,
2008 the Series D Preferred Stock had a conversion rate of approximately
0.2479 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $100.85 per share of common
stock.

12.  Preferred stock and excess stock (continued)

Preferred stock and excess stock authorizations

Our charter authorizes the
issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 15,185,500
shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2008. In addition,
200,000,000 shares of “excess stock” (as defined) are authorized, none of which
were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2008.

13.  Stock plan

1997 Stock plan

In 1997, we adopted a
stock option and incentive plan for the purpose of attracting and retaining the
highest quality personnel, providing for additional incentives and promoting
the success of the company by providing employees the opportunity to acquire
common stock pursuant to (1) options to purchase common stock; and (2) share
awards.  In May 2008, we amended and
restated the 1997 stock option and incentive plan (the “Restated 1997 Stock
Plan”) to increase the number of shares reserved for the grant of awards and
extend the term of the Restated 1997 Stock Plan to May 2018, among other
amendments.  As of December 31,
2008, a total of 942,510 shares were reserved for the granting of future options
and share awards under the Stock Plan.

Options under our plan
have been granted at prices that are equal to the market value of the stock on
the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. We have not
granted any stock options since 2002. 
The options outstanding under the Restated 1997 Stock Plan expire at
various dates through October 2012.

The fair values of the
options issued under the Restated 1997 Stock Plan were estimated at the date of
grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions for 2008, 2007 and 2006:

A summary of the stock
option activity under our Restated 1997 Stock Plan and related information for
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 follows:

Stock plan (continued)

The following table
summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31,
2008:

The aggregate intrinsic
value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2008 was approximately
$3.1 million.

In addition, the Restated
1997 Stock Plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees and
non-employee directors.  A share award is
an award of common stock, which (i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may
be subject to the risk of forfeiture under Section 83 of the Internal
Revenue Code.  Shares issued generally
vest over a three year period from the date of issuance and the sale of the
shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.   The unearned portion of these awards is
amortized as stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period.

As of December 31,
2008 and 2007 there were 475,421 and 457,956, respectively, nonvested share
awards outstanding.  During 2008, we granted
230,663 shares of common stock, 209,523 share awards vested and 3,675 shares
were forfeited.  During 2007, we granted
294,376 shares of common stock, 275,487 share awards vested and 5,282  shares were forfeited.  During 2006, we granted 286,569 shares of
common stock, 105,782 share awards vested and 7,975 shares were forfeited.  The weighted average grant-date fair value of
share awards granted during 2008 was approximately $96.76 per share and the
total fair value of share awards vested, based on the market price on the
vesting date, was approximately $19.3 million. 
As of December 31, 2008, there was $34.3 million of unrecognized
compensation related to nonvested share awards under the Stock Plan, which is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately one
year.  Capitalized stock compensation was
approximately $7,019,000, $8,677,000 and $3,741,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, and is included as a reduction of general and administrative
costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

14.
Non-cash transactions

During the year ended
December 31, 2008, building improvements and equipment aggregating $13,407,000
was transferred to the Company in a non-cash transaction.  The amount of building improvements and
equipment recognized in this transaction was determined based upon the
estimated fair value of the improvements received.  This amount is also recognized as additional
rental income amortized over the remaining term of the applicable lease.

During the year ended December 31,
2007, our non-cash transaction related to the acquisition of one property
located in the Eastern Massachusetts market  
During the year ended December 31, 2006, our non-cash transactions
related to the acquisition seven properties in one transaction located in the
Eastern Massachusetts market and the acquisition of one land parcel in a second
unrelated transaction located in the San Francisco Bay market.  The following table summarizes these transactions
