ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994
that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  We are the largest owner and pre-eminent
first-in-class REIT focused principally on science-driven cluster
formation.  We are the leading provider of high-quality
environmentally sustainable real estate, technical infrastructure and services
to the broad and diverse life science industry.  Client tenants include
institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit institutions), pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, medical device, product, service and translational entities, as
well as government agencies. Our operating platform is based on the
principle of “clustering,” with assets and operations located in key life
science markets.  As of December 31, 2009, we had 156 properties (152
properties located in ten states in the United States and four properties
located in Canada) containing approximately 12.7 million rentable square feet
(including spaces undergoing active redevelopment) and properties undergoing
ground-up development of approximately 980,000 rentable square feet.

Business
and strategy

We focus our property operations and investment
activities principally in the following life science markets:

·

California – San Diego;

·

California – San Francisco Bay;

·

Eastern Massachusetts;

·

New Jersey/Suburban Philadelphia;

·

New York City;

·

Southeast;

·

Suburban Washington, D.C.;

·

Washington – Seattle; and

·

International.

Our client tenant base is broad and diverse within the
life science industry and reflects our focus on regional, national and
international tenants with substantial financial and operational
resources.  For a more detailed
description of our properties and tenants, see “Item 2. Properties.”  We have an experienced board of directors and
are led by a senior management team with extensive experience in both the real
estate and life science industries.

2009 demonstrated the strength and durability of our
core operations providing office/laboratory space to the broad and diverse life
science industry.  Our core operating results were relatively steady for
the year ended December 31, 2009, during the continuing extraordinary and
unprecedented United States and worldwide economic, financial, banking and
credit market crises, significant worldwide economic recession and drastic
decline in consumer confidence and the consumer driven economy.  Financial systems throughout the world have
recently experienced significant periods of illiquidity with banks much less
willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers.

The economic, financial and banking environment and
consumer confidence have improved since the depth of the crisis in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. 
Even with the recent improvements, we remain cautious regarding the
economic, financial and banking environment. 
We intend to continue to focus on the completion of  our existing active redevelopment projects
aggregating approximately 575,152 rentable square feet and our existing active
development projects aggregating approximately an additional 980,000 rentable
square feet. Additionally, we intend to continue with preconstruction
activities for certain land parcels for future ground-up/vertical above ground
development in order to preserve and create value for these projects.  These important preconstruction activities
add significant value to our land for future ground-up development and are
required for the ultimate vertical construction of the buildings.  We also intend to be very careful and prudent
with any future decisions to add new projects to our active ground-up/vertical
developments.  Future ground-up/vertical
development projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high
quality and/or credit entities.  We also
intend to continue to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital
structure over a multi-year period. 
During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt
maturities.  We expect the source of
funds for construction activities and repayment of outstanding debt to be
provided over several years by opportunistic sales of real estate, joint
ventures, cash flows from operations, new secured or unsecured debt and the
issuance of additional equity securities, as appropriate. As of December 31,
2009, we had identified three assets as “held for sale,” which have been
classified in discontinued operations.


We seek to maximize funds from operations (“FFO”),
balance sheet liquidity and flexibility and cash available for distribution to
our stockholders through the ownership, operation, management and selective
redevelopment, development and acquisition of life science properties, as well
as management of our balance sheet.  See “Item
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations-Funds From Operations” for a discussion of how we compute and view
FFO, as well as a discussion of other measures of cash flow. In particular, we seek
to maximize FFO, balance sheet liquidity and flexibility and cash available for
distribution by:

·

maintaining a strong, liquid and flexible balance
sheet;

·

re-tenanting and re-leasing space at higher rental
rates while minimizing tenant improvement costs;

·

maintaining solid occupancy while also maintaining
high lease rental rates;

·

realizing contractual rental rate escalations, which
are currently provided for in approximately 93% of our leases (on a rentable
square footage basis);

·

implementing effective cost control measures,
including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating
expenses and certain capital expenditures;

·

improving investment returns through leasing of vacant
space and replacement of existing tenants with new tenants at higher rental
rates;

·

achieving higher rental rates from existing tenants as
existing leases expire;

·

selectively redeveloping existing office, warehouse,
shell space or newly acquired properties into generic laboratory space that can
be leased at higher rental rates in our target life science cluster markets;
and

·

selectively developing properties in our target life
science cluster markets.

Redevelopment

A key component of our long term business model is the
redevelopment of existing office, warehouse or shell space as generic
office/laboratory space, including the conversion of single tenancy space to
multi-tenancy spaces or multi-tenancy spaces to single tenancy space that can
be leased at higher rates.  As of December 31,
2009, we had approximately 575,152 rentable square feet undergoing
redevelopment at ten projects.  In
addition to properties undergoing redevelopment, as of December 31, 2009,
our asset base contained embedded opportunities for a future permanent change
of use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating
approximately 1.5 million rentable square feet.

Development

Another key component of our long term business model
is ground-up development projects.  Our
development strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects where we expect
to achieve appropriate investment returns. 
We generally have undertaken ground-up development projects only if our
investment in infrastructure will be substantially made for generic, rather
than tenant specific, improvements. As of December 31, 2009, we had six
parcels of land undergoing ground-up development approximating 980,000 rentable
square feet of office/laboratory space. 
We also have an embedded pipeline for future ground-up development
approximating 11.1 million developable square feet of office/laboratory
space.  Future ground-up/vertical
development projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high
quality and/or credit entities.

Tenants

As of December 31,
2009, we had 417 leases with a total of 342 tenants, and 74 of our 156
properties were single-tenant properties. 
Our three largest tenants accounted for approximately 17.1% of our
aggregate annualized base rent, or approximately 8.0%, 4.7% and 4.4%, respectively.
None of our tenants represented more than 10% of total revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2009.


Competition

In general, other life science properties are located
in close proximity to our properties. The amount of rentable space available in
any market could have a material effect on our ability to rent space and on the
rents that we can earn.  In addition, we
compete for investment opportunities with insurance companies, pension and investment
funds, private equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies,
other REITs, and owner/occupants. Many of these entities have substantially
greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more than us or
accept more risk than we are willing to accept. 
These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the
creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic concentration of their
investments.  Competition may also reduce
the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase
the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.  Competition in acquiring existing properties
and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other REITs, has
been very strong over the past several years. We believe we have differentiated
ourselves from our competitors, as we are the largest owner, manager and
developer of life science properties, in key life science markets.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS

The global financial crisis,
and other events or circumstances beyond the control of the Company, may
adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations, contractual
commitments, and access to capital.

What began initially in
2007 and 2008 as a “subprime” mortgage crisis turned into an extraordinary
United States and worldwide structural economic and financial crisis coupled
with the rapid decline of the consumer economy. Recently, in 2008 and 2009
significant concerns over energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability
and cost of credit, the United States mortgage market and a declining real
estate market in the United States have contributed to increased volatility and
diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward.  These factors, combined with volatile oil
prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment,
have precipitated a steep economic decline and fears of a deep and prolonged
recession.  Further, severe financial and
structural strains on the banking and financial systems have led to significant
lack of trust and confidence in the global credit and financial system.  Consumers and money managers have and may
liquidate equity investments and consumers and banks have and may hold cash and
other lower risk investments, resulting in significant and, in some cases,
catastrophic declines in the equity capitalization of companies and unusual
failures of financial institutions.  Additionally,
financial systems throughout the world are undergoing severe structural changes
with banks much less willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and
borrowers.  This extraordinary level of
illiquidity has caused a significant decline in available credit from financial
institutions and other lenders and the unprecedented declines in the market
values of United States and foreign stock exchanges has led to significantly
higher cost of debt and equity capital.

The United States and
foreign governments have taken extraordinary actions in an attempt to deal with
the worldwide financial crisis and the severe decline in the consumer driven
economy.  These extraordinary actions,
including the merger of large financial institutions and significant
investment in and control by government bodies, has so far resulted in
some relief to the frozen markets. 
Additionally, extraordinary government controls have been attempted,
including a temporary ban of “short sales” on certain publicly traded stocks
and guarantees of money market funds, which have also resulted in limited
relief, if any, to the credit markets. 
The resulting and ongoing lack of available credit, lack of lending
between financial institutions and other key lending sources (such as life insurance
companies and pension funds), lack of lending to borrowers and further
failures and consolidation of financial institutions could
materially and adversely affect our tenants, key vendors and contractors,
financial condition, results of operations, ability to fund our construction
activities, ability to refinance debt and other capital needs and our access to
capital.

There can be no assurance that actions of the United States Government,
Federal Reserve, and other government and regulatory bodies for the purpose of
stabilizing the financial markets will achieve the intended effect.

In an unprecedented response to the financial and
economic crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going
concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, on October 3,
2008, former President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of
2008 (“EESA”) into law.  Pursuant to the
EESA, the United States Treasury has the authority to, among other things,
purchase up to $700 billion of mortgage-backed and other securities from
financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial
markets.  The federal government, the
Federal Reserve Board, and other government and regulatory bodies have taken or
are considering other actions to address the financial crisis.  There can be no assurance as to what impact
such actions or future actions will have on the financial markets, including
the extreme levels of volatility currently being experienced.  Such continued volatility could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations, or the trading price of our common stock.

Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented.

The capital and credit markets have been experiencing
volatility and disruption for more than 12 months.  In some cases, the markets have produced
downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers
without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial and/or operating
strength.  If current levels of market
disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we
will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 
Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may also
limit our access to capital from financial institutions on favorable terms, or
at all, and our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity
securities could be adversely affected by causes beyond the control of the
Company through ongoing extraordinary disruptions in the global economy and
financial systems or other events.


We may not
be able to obtain additional capital to further our business objectives.

Our ability to develop, redevelop or acquire
properties depends upon our ability to obtain capital.  The real estate industry has recently
experienced volatile debt and equity capital markets with periods of extreme
illiquidity.  A prolonged period in which
we cannot effectively access the public equity or debt markets may result in
heavier reliance on alternative financing sources to undertake new
investments.  An inability to obtain
equity or debt capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from
acquiring, financing and completing desirable investments, and which could
otherwise adversely affect our business. 
Also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or interests in
subsidiaries to fund future operations could dilute the ownership of our
then-existing stockholders.  Even as
liquidity returns to the market, debt and equity capital may be more expensive
than in prior years.

Possible
future sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect its market
price.

We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales
of shares of our common stock on the market price of our common stock from time
to time.  Sales of substantial amounts of
capital stock (including common stock issued upon the exercise of stock
options, the conversion of convertible debt securities or the conversion or
redemption of preferred stock), or the perception that such sales may occur,
could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.

We have reserved a number of shares of common stock
for issuance to our officers, directors and employees pursuant to our Amended
and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (sometimes referred to herein
as our equity incentive plan).  As of December 31,
2009, a total of 629,896 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance
under our Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan.

As of December 31, 2009, options to purchase
118,225 shares of our common stock were outstanding, all of which were
exercisable.  We have filed a
registration statement with respect to the issuance of shares of our common
stock pursuant to grants under our equity incentive plan.  In addition, any shares issued under our
equity incentive plan will be available for sale in the public market from time
to time without restriction by persons who are not our “affiliates” (as defined
in Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act).  Affiliates will be able to sell shares of our
common stock subject to restrictions under Rule 144.

The price
per share of our stock may fluctuate significantly.

The market price per share of our
common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors,
including:

·

the
availability of debt and/or equity capital;

·

the
condition of our balance sheet;

·

the
condition of the financial and banking industries;

·

actual
or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends;

·

the
amount and timing of debt maturities and other contractual obligations;

·

changes
in our FFO or earnings estimates;

·

the
publication of research reports about us, the real estate industry, or the life
science industry;

·

the
general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities
in comparison to other debt or equity securities (including securities issued
by other real estate-based companies);

·

general
stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed
income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand
a higher annual yield from future dividends;

·

changes
in our analyst ratings;

·

changes
in market valuations of similar companies;

·

adverse
market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;

·

additions
or departures of key management personnel;

·

actions
by institutional stockholders;

·

speculation
in the press or investment community;

·

terrorist
activity adversely affecting the markets in which our securities trade,
possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of
business and consumer confidence and spending;

·

government
regulatory action and changes in tax laws;

·

the
realization of any of the other risk factors included in this annual report on Form 10-K;
and

·

general
market and economic conditions.

Many of the factors listed above
are beyond our control.  These factors
may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline, regardless
of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects.


Our debt
service obligations may have adverse consequences on our business operations.

We use debt to finance our operations, including the
development, redevelopment and acquisitions of properties. Our use of debt may
have adverse consequences, including the following:

·

our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to
meet required payments of principal and interest;

·

we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our
properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on our debt;

·

we may default on our debt obligations, and the
lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure those loans;

·

a foreclosure on one of our properties could create
taxable income without any accompanying cash proceeds to pay the tax;

·

a default under a mortgage loan that has cross default
provisions may cause us to automatically default on another loan;

·

we may not be able to refinance or extend our existing
debt;

·

the terms of any refinancing or extension may not be
as favorable as the terms of our existing debt;

·

we may be subject to a significant increase in the
variable interest rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
and certain other borrowings, which could adversely impact our operations; and

·

the terms of our debt obligations may require a
reduction in our distributions to stockholders.

As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding
mortgage indebtedness of approximately $937.0 million (net of $2.1 million
discount), secured by 57 properties and one land development parcel, and
outstanding debt under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan of
approximately $1.2 billion.  In addition,
as of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $368.0 million (net of $16.7
million discount) and $215.9 million (net of $24.1 million discount) of 3.70%
and 8.00% unsecured convertible notes outstanding, respectively.

We may not
be able to refinance our debt and/or our debt may not be assumable.

Due to the high volume of real estate debt financing
in recent years, the industry may require more funds to refinance debt
maturities than the potential funds available from lenders.  This potential shortage of available funds
from lenders may limit our ability to refinance our debt as it matures, our
cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price
of our common stock.

We have approximately $1.8 billion in unsecured
corporate debt.  This debt may be
unassumable by a potential purchaser and may be subject to significant
prepayment penalties.

We may not
be able to borrow additional amounts under our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan.

Aggregate unsecured borrowings under our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan is limited to an amount based primarily
on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties and
our cost basis of certain land and construction projects and compliance with
certain financial and non-financial covenants. 
Borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
are funded by a group of approximately 50 banks.  Our ability to borrow additional amounts
under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan may be negatively
impacted by a decrease in cash flows from our properties, a default or cross
default under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan,
non-compliance with one or more loan covenants and non-performance or failure
of one or more lenders under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan. In addition, we may not be able to refinance or repay outstanding
borrowings on our unsecured line of credit or unsecured term loan.  Our inability to borrow additional amounts
could delay or prevent us from acquiring, financing and completing desirable
investments, which could adversely affect our business; and our inability to
refinance or repay amounts under our unsecured line of credit or unsecured term
loan may adversely affect our cash flows, ability to make distributions to our
stockholders, financial condition and results of operations.


Our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict our ability to engage
in some business activities.

Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
contain customary negative covenants and other financial and operating
covenants that, among other things:

·

restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;

·

restrict our ability to make certain investments;

·

restrict our ability to merge with another company;

·

restrict our ability to make distributions to
stockholders;

·

require us to maintain financial coverage ratios; and

·

require us to maintain a pool of unencumbered assets
approved by the lenders.

These restrictions could
cause us to default on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan or
negatively affect our operations and our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders.

We could
become highly leveraged and our debt service obligations could increase.

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount
of debt that we may incur.  Therefore, we
could become highly leveraged.  This
would result in an increase in our debt service obligations that could
adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders.  Higher leverage could also
increase the risk of default on our debt obligations.

If
interest rates rise, our debt service costs will increase and the value of our
properties may decrease.

Our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and
certain other borrowings bear interest at variable rates, and we may incur
additional debt in the future.  Increases
in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt
instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness
or obtaining new debt.  Additionally,
increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our
real estate and decrease the market price of our common stock.  Accordingly, these increases could adversely
affect our financial position and our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders.

Failure to
hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our
results of operations.

The interest rate hedge
agreements we use to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility
involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their
obligations under these arrangements.  In
addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to
changes in interest rates.  These risk
factors may lead to failure to hedge effectively against changes in interest
rates and therefore may adversely affect our results of operations.

We are subject to risks and
liabilities in connection with properties owned through partnerships, limited
liability companies and joint ventures.

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount
of funds that we may invest in non-wholly owned partnerships, limited liability
companies or joint ventures. 
Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments
involve certain risks, including:

·

upon bankruptcy of non-wholly owned partnerships,
limited liability companies, or joint venture entities, we may become liable
for the partnership’s, limited liability company’s or joint venture’s
liabilities;

·

we may share certain approval rights over major
decisions with third parties;

·

we may be required to contribute such capital if our
partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions;

·

our partners, co-members or joint ventures might have
economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our
business interests or goals and that could affect our ability to operate the
property or our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT;

·

our ability to sell the interest on advantageous terms
when we desire may be limited or restricted under the terms of our agreements
with our partners; and

·

we may not continue to own or operate the interests or
assets underlying such relationship or may need to purchase such interests or
assets at an above market price to continue ownership.


We generally seek to
maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies
and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives. However, we
may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described
above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
cash flow, ability to make distributions to our stockholders or the market
price of our common stock.

The conversion rights of
our

3.70%

unsecured convertible notes may be detrimental to holders of our common
stock.

As of
December 31, 2009, we had approximately $368.0 million, net of $16.7 million
discount, outstanding on our unsecured convertible notes with a coupon of 3.70%
(the “3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes”).

Prior to January 15, 2012, we will not have the
right to redeem the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes, except to preserve our
qualification as a REIT.  On and after
that date, we have the right to redeem the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes,
in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for cash equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes to be
redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
redemption date.  Holders of the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase their notes, in whole
or in part, on January 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022 for cash equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.  Holders of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible
Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the
occurrence of specified corporate transactions, including a change in control,
certain merger or consolidation transactions or the liquidation of the Company
(each, a “Fundamental Change”), at a repurchase price in cash equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

At issuance, the
3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of
approximately 8.4774 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the
3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes, representing a conversion price of
approximately $117.96 per share of our common stock.  This initial conversion price represented a
premium of 20% based on the last reported sale price of $98.30 per share of our
common stock on January 10, 2007. 
The conversion rate of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes is subject
to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain
dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.74 per share per quarter and
dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2009, the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes had a conversion rate of approximately 8.5207
shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.70% Unsecured
Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately
$117.36 per share of our common stock. 
Holders of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes may convert their notes
into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock prior to the stated
maturity of January 15, 2027 only under the following circumstances: (1) during
any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2007, if
the closing sale price of our common stock for each of 20 or more trading days
in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of
the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price
in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar
quarter; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after
any five consecutive trading day period (the “3.70% Unsecured Convertible Note
Measurement Period”) in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes was equal to or less than 98% of
the average conversion value of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes during
the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Note Measurement

Period;
(3) upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change; (4) if we call the
3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes for redemption; and (5) at any time
from, and including, December 15, 2026 until the close of business on the
business day immediately preceding January 15, 2027 or earlier redemption
or repurchase.

The conversion of the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes into our common stock would dilute stockholder
ownership in the Company, and could adversely affect the market price of our
common stock or impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of
additional equity securities.  Any adjustments that increase the
conversion rate of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes would increase their
dilutive effect.  Further, the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes may be
converted into cash at a time when we need to conserve our cash reserves, in
which event, such conversion may adversely affect us and our stockholders.

The conversion rights of our 8.00% unsecured convertible notes may be
detrimental to holders of our common stock.

In April 2009, we
completed a private offering of $240 million unsecured convertible notes with a
coupon of 8.00% (the “8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes”).  As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
$215.9 million, net of $24.1 million discount, outstanding on our 8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes.  Prior to April 20,
2014, we will not have the right to redeem the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible
Notes, except to preserve our qualification as a REIT.  On and after that date, we have the right to
redeem the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, in whole or in part, at any time
and from time to time, for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the redemption date.  Holders of the
8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase their notes, in
whole or in part, on April 15, 2014, 2019 and 2024 for cash equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.  Holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible
Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the
occurrence of a Fundamental Change, at a repurchase price in cash equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

At issuance, the
8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes had an initial


conversion rate of approximately 24.1546
shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes, representing a conversion price of approximately $41.40 per
share of our common stock.  This initial
conversion price represented a premium of 15% based on the last reported sale
price of $36.00 per share of our common stock on April 21, 2009.  The conversion rate of the 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but
not limited to, certain cash dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.35
per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of
our common stock.  As of December 31,
2009, there was no change from the initial conversion rate of our 8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes.  Holders of
the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes may convert their notes prior to the
stated maturity date of April 15, 2029 only under the following
circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter
ending June 30, 2009, if the closing sale price of our common stock for
each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter
exceeds or is equal to 130% of the conversion price in effect on the last
trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the
five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading
day period (the “8.00% Unsecured Convertible Note Measurement Period”) in which
the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average conversion value
of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes during the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible
Note Measurement Period; (3) upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change; (4) if
we call the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes for redemption; and (5) at
any time from, and including, March 15, 2029 until the close of business
on the business day immediately preceding April 15, 2029 or earlier
redemption or repurchase.  Upon
conversion, holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes will receive cash,
shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, as the case may be, at
our election.

The conversion of the 8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes into our common stock would dilute stockholder
ownership in the Company, and could adversely affect the market price of our
common stock or impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of
additional equity securities.  Any adjustments that increase the
conversion rate of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes would increase their
dilutive effect.  Further, the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes may be
converted into cash at a time when we need to conserve our cash reserves, in
which event, such conversion may adversely affect us and our stockholders.

The conversion rights of
our convertible preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock.

As of December 31, 2009, we
had approximately $250 million outstanding of 7.00% series D cumulative
convertible preferred stock (“Series D Convertible Preferred Stock”).  The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain
conditions.  At December 31, 2009,
the conversion rate for the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock was
0.2480 shares of our common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was
equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $100.81 per share of common
stock.  The conversion rate for the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events,
including, but not limited to certain dividends on our common stock in excess
of $0.78 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in
shares of our common stock.  In addition,
on or after April 20, 2013, we may, at our option, be able to cause some
or all of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically
converted if the closing sale price per share of our common stock equals or
exceeds 150% of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to our
issuance of a press release announcing the exercise of our conversion
option.  Holders of our Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock, at their option, may, at any time and from time to
time, convert some or all of their outstanding shares.

The
conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for our common
stock would dilute stockholder ownership in our company, and could adversely
affect the market price of our common stock or impair our ability to raise
capital through the sale of additional equity securities.  Any adjustments that increase the conversion
rate of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock would increase their
dilutive effect.  Further, the conversion
rights by the holders of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock might be
triggered in situations where we need to conserve our cash reserves, in which
event, our election, under certain conditions, to repurchase such Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock in lieu of converting them into common stock might
adversely affect us and our stockholders.

We may not be able to sell
our properties quickly to raise money.

Investments in real estate
are relatively illiquid compared to other investments.  Accordingly, we may not be able to sell our
properties when we desire or at prices acceptable to us in response to changes
in economic or other conditions.  In
addition, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue
Code”) limits our ability to sell properties held for fewer than two
years.  These limitations on our ability
to sell our properties may adversely affect our cash flows, our ability to
repay debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.


If our revenues are less
than our expenses, we may have to borrow additional funds and we may not be
able to make distributions to our stockholders.

If our properties do not
generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including our debt
service obligations and capital expenditures, we may have to borrow additional
amounts to cover fixed costs and cash flow needs.  This could adversely affect our ability to
make distributions to our stockholders. 
Factors that could adversely affect the revenues we generate from, and
the values of, our properties include:

·

national, local and worldwide economic conditions;

·

competition from other life science properties;

·

changes in the life science industry;

·

real estate conditions in our target markets;

·

our ability to collect rent payments;

·

the availability of financing;

·

changes to the financial and banking industries;

·

changes in interest rate levels;

·

vacancies at our properties and our ability to
re-lease space;

·

changes in tax or other regulatory laws;

·

the costs of compliance with government regulation;

·

the lack of liquidity of real estate investments; and

·

increases in operating costs.

In addition, if a lease at a
property is not a triple net lease, we will have greater expenses associated
with that property and greater exposure to increases in such expenses.  Significant expenditures, such as mortgage
payments, real estate taxes and insurance and maintenance costs are generally
fixed and do not decrease when revenues at the related property decrease.

Our distributions to
stockholders may decline at any time.

We may not continue our
current level of distributions to our stockholders. Our board of directors will
determine future distributions based on a number of factors, including:

·

our amount of cash available for distribution;

·

our financial condition;

·

any decision by our board of directors to reinvest
funds rather than to distribute such funds;

·

our capital expenditures;

·

the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code;

·

restrictions under Maryland law; and

·

other factors our board of directors deems relevant.

A reduction in
distributions to stockholders may negatively impact our stock price.

Distributions
on our common stock may be made in the form of cash, stock, or a combination of
both

.

As a REIT, we are
required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders.
Typically, we generate cash for distributions through our operations, the
disposition of assets, or the incurrence of additional debt. Our board of
directors may determine in the future, to pay dividends on our common stock in
cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common
stock. The Internal Revenue Service recently issued Revenue Procedure 2010-12,
which provides guidance regarding certain dividends payable in cash or stock at
the election of stockholders and declared with respect to taxable years ending
on or before December 31, 2011. 
Under Revenue Procedure 2010-12, a distribution of our stock pursuant to
such an election will be considered a taxable distribution of property in an
amount equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead if,
among other things, 10% or more of the distribution is payable in cash.  Any such dividend would be distributed in a
manner intended to count toward satisfaction of our annual distribution
requirements and to qualify for the dividends paid deduction.  A reduction in the cash yield on our common
stock may negatively impact our stock price.


We may be unsuccessful
with our real estate development and redevelopment activities.

A key component of our long
term business model consists of the ground-up development and redevelopment of
space for lease. Our success with our development and redevelopment projects
depends on many risks that may adversely affect our business, including those
associated with:

·

negative worldwide economic, financial, and banking
conditions;

·

worldwide economic recession and lack of confidence;

·

the seizure or illiquidity of credit markets;

·

national, local and worldwide economic conditions;

·

delays in construction;

·

budget overruns;

·

lack of availability and/or increasing costs of materials;

·

commodity pricing of building materials and supplies;

·

financing availability;

·

changes in the life sciences, financial and banking
industries;

·

volatility in interest rates;

·

labor availability and/or strikes;

·

uncertainty of leasing;

·

timing of the commencement of rental payments;

·

changes in local submarket conditions;

·

delays or denials of entitlements or permits; and

·

other property development uncertainties.

In addition, development and redevelopment
activities, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, typically
require a substantial portion of management’s time and attention.  This may distract management from focusing on
other operational activities.  If we are
unable to complete development projects successfully, our business may be
adversely affected.

We have spaces available
for redevelopment that may be difficult to redevelop or successfully lease to
tenants.

A key component of our long
term business model is redevelopment of existing office, warehouse or shell
space as generic office/laboratory space, including the conversion of single
tenancy space to multi-tenancy spaces or multi-tenancy spaces to single tenancy
space that can be leased at higher rates. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to complete spaces undergoing redevelopment or initiate additional
redevelopment projects.  Redevelopment
activities subject us to many risks, including delays in permitting, financing
availability, engaging contractors, the availability and pricing of materials
and labor and other redevelopment uncertainties.  In addition, there can be no assurance that,
upon completion, we will be able to successfully lease the space or lease the
space at rental rates at or above the returns on our investment anticipated by
our stockholders.

Improvements to life
science properties are significantly more costly than traditional office space.

Our properties contain
infrastructure improvements that are significantly more costly than other
property types.  Although we have
historically been able to recover the additional investment in infrastructure
improvements through higher rental rates, there is the risk that we will not be
able to continue to do so in the future. Typical improvements include:

·

reinforced concrete floors;

·

upgraded roof loading capacity;

·

increased floor to ceiling heights;

·

heavy-duty heating, ventilation and air conditioning
(“HVAC”) systems;

·

enhanced environmental control technology;

·

significantly upgraded electrical, gas and plumbing
infrastructure; and

·

laboratory benches.


We could default on leases
for land on which some of our properties are located or held for future
development.

As of December 31,
2009, we held ground lease obligations including leases for 19 of our
properties and three land development parcels. 
These lease obligations have remaining lease terms from 23 to 97 years,
excluding extension options.  If we default
under the terms of any particular lease, we may lose the ownership rights to
the property subject to the lease.  Upon
expiration of a lease and all of its options, we may not be able to renegotiate
a new lease on favorable terms, if at all. 
The loss of the ownership rights to these properties or an increase of
rental expense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flow, stock price and ability to satisfy our debt
service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders.

We may not be able to
operate properties successfully.

Our success depends in large
part upon our ability to operate our properties successfully.  If we are unable to do so, our business could
be adversely affected.  The ownership and
operation of real estate is subject to many risks that may adversely affect our
business and our ability to make payments to our stockholders, including the
risks that:

·

our properties may not perform as we expect;

·

we may lease space at rates below our expectations;

·

we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable
terms; and

·

we may underestimate the cost of improvements required
to maintain or improve space up to standards established for the market position
intended for that property.

If
we encounter any of these risks, our business and our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.

We may experience
increased operating costs, which may reduce profitability.

Our
properties are subject to increases in operating expenses including cleaning,
electricity, HVAC, administrative costs and other costs associated with
security, landscaping and repairs and maintenance of our properties.

As of December 31,
2009, approximately 88% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were
triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes
and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including increases
thereto.  In addition, approximately 8%
of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay
a majority of operating expenses.

However, we cannot be certain that our tenants will be able to bear the
full burden of these higher costs, or that such increased costs will not lead
them, or other prospective tenants, to seek space elsewhere.  If operating expenses increase, the
availability of other comparable space in the markets we operate in may hinder
or limit our ability to increase our rents; if operating expenses increase
without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish
and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

We face substantial
competition in our target markets.

The significant competition
for business in our target markets could have an adverse effect on our
operations.  We compete for investment
opportunities with:

·

insurance companies;

·

pension and investment funds;

·

private equity entities;

·

partnerships;

·

developers;

·

investment companies;

·

other REITs; and

·

owners/occupants.

Many of these entities have
substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay
more than we can or accept more risk than we are willing to accept.  These entities may be less sensitive to risks
with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic
concentration of their investments. 
Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment
opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property
owners seeking to sell.


Poor economic conditions
in our markets could adversely affect our business.

Our properties are located
in the following markets:

·

California – San Diego;

·

California – San Francisco Bay;

·

Eastern Massachusetts;

·

New Jersey/Suburban Philadelphia;

·

New York City;

·

Southeast;

·

Suburban Washington, D.C.;

·

Washington – Seattle; and

·

International.

As a result of our
geographic concentration, we depend upon the local economic conditions in these
markets, including local real estate conditions.  We are, therefore, subject to increased
exposure (positive or negative) to economic, tax, currency fluctuations, and
other competitive factors specific to markets in confined geographic
areas.  Our operations may also be
affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these
markets.  An economic downturn in any of
these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make
distributions to stockholders.  We cannot
assure our stockholders that these markets will continue to grow or will remain
favorable to the life science industry.

We are largely dependent
on the life science industry for revenues from lease payments.

In general, our business and
strategy is to invest primarily in properties used by tenants in the life
science industry.  Our business could be
adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by the current
economic, financial and banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates
from the United States to other countries. 
Because of our industry focus, events within the life science industry
may have a more pronounced effect on our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders than if we had more diversified investments.  Also, some of our properties may be better
suited for a particular life science industry tenant and could require
modification before we are able to re-lease vacant space to another life
science industry tenant.  Generally, our
properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants without
significant expenditures on renovations.

Our ability to negotiate
contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in
rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science
properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are
proposed.

Our tenants may not be
able to pay us if they are unsuccessful in discovering, developing, making or
selling their products and technologies.

Our life science industry
tenants are subject to a number of risks, including the following, any one or
more of which may adversely affect their ability to make rental payments to us:

·

Some of our tenants developing potential drugs may
find that their drugs are not effective, or may even be harmful, when tested in
humans.

·

Some of our tenants depend on availability of
reimbursements from various government entities or private insurance plans and
reimbursements may decrease in the future.

·

Some of our tenants may not be able to manufacture
their drugs economically, even if such drugs are proven through human clinical
trials to be safe and effective in humans.

·

Drugs that are developed and manufactured by some of
our tenants require regulatory approval, including the approval of the United
States Food and Drug Administration, prior to being made, marketed, sold and
used.  The regulatory approval process to
manufacture and market drugs is costly, typically takes several years, requires
the expenditure of substantial resources and is often unpredictable.  A tenant may fail or experience significant
delays in obtaining these approvals.

·

Some of our tenants and their licensors require
patent, copyright or trade secret protection to develop, make, market and sell
their products and technologies.  A
tenant may be unable to commercialize its products or technologies if patents
covering such products or technologies do not issue, or are successfully
challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented by third parties, or if the
tenant fails to obtain licenses to the discoveries of third parties necessary
to commercialize its products or technologies.


·

A drug made by a tenant may not be well accepted by
doctors and patients, may be less effective or accepted than a competitor’s
drugs, or may be subsequently recalled from the market, even if it is
successfully developed, proven safe and effective in human clinical trials,
manufactured and the requisite regulatory approvals are obtained.

·

Some of our tenants require significant funding to
develop and commercialize their products and technologies, which funding must be
obtained from venture capital firms, private investors, the public markets,
companies in the life science industry or federal, state and local
governments.  Such funding may become
unavailable or difficult to obtain.  The
ability of each tenant to raise capital will depend on their financial and
operating condition and the overall condition of the financial, banking and
economic environment.

·

Even with sufficient funding, some of our tenants may
not be able to discover or identify potential drug targets in humans, or
potential drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or technologies which are
commercially useful in the discovery or identification of potential drug
targets or drugs.

We cannot assure our
stockholders that our tenants will be able to develop, make, market or sell
their products and technologies due to the risks inherent in the life science
industry.  Any tenant that is unable to
avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above, may have difficulty
making rental payments to us.

Our inability to renew
leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire may significantly
affect our business.

Our revenues are derived
primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under
our leases. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types
of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely payments under its
lease.  Also, when our tenants decide not
to renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to re-lease the
space.  Even if tenants decide to renew
or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any
tenant improvements, concessions and lease commissions, may be less favorable
to us than current lease terms. 
Consequently, we could generate less cash flow from the affected
properties than expected, which could negatively impact our business.  We may have to divert cash flow generated by
other properties to meet our debt service payments, if any, or to pay other
expenses related to owning the affected properties.  As of December 31, 2009, leases at our
properties representing approximately 8.7% and 15.1% of the aggregate total
square footage of our properties, excluding month-to-month leases, were
scheduled to expire in 2010 and 2011, respectively.

The inability of a tenant
to pay us rent could adversely affect our business.

Our revenues are derived
primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under
our leases.  If our tenants, especially
significant tenants, fail to make rental payments under their leases, our
financial condition, cash flow and ability to make distributions to our
stockholders could be adversely affected.

As of December 31,
2009, we had 417 leases with a total of 342 tenants, and 74 of our 156
properties were single-tenant properties. 
Our three largest tenants accounted for approximately 17.1% of our
aggregate annualized base rent, or approximately 8.0%, 4.7% and 4.4%,
respectively.  “Annualized base rent”
means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31,
2009, using rental revenues calculated on a straight-line basis in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  Annualized base rent does not include
reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and
other operating expenses, substantially all of which are borne by the tenants
in the case of triple net leases.

The bankruptcy or insolvency
of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a
property.  If any of our tenants becomes
a debtor in a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, we cannot
evict that tenant solely because of its bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant
to reject and terminate its lease with us. 
Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject
to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining
rent actually owed to us under the tenant’s lease.  Any shortfall in rent payments could
adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders.


Our

United
States

government tenants may
not receive annual budget appropriations, which could adversely affect their
ability to pay us.

United States government
tenants may be subject to annual budget appropriations.  If one of our United States government
tenants fails to receive its annual budget appropriation, it might not be able
to make its lease payments to us.  In
addition, defaults under leases with federal government tenants are governed by
federal statute and not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws.  All of our leases with United States
government tenants provide that the government tenant may terminate the lease
under certain circumstances.  As of December 31,
2009, leases with United States government tenants at our properties accounted
for approximately 2.7% of our aggregate annualized base rent.

We could be held liable
for damages resulting from our tenants’ use of hazardous materials.

Many of our life science
industry tenants engage in research and development activities that involve
controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and biological and radioactive
compounds.  In the event of contamination
or injury from the use of these hazardous materials, we could be held liable
for damages that result.  This liability
could exceed our resources and any recovery available through any applicable
environmental remediation insurance coverage, and could adversely affect our
ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Together with our tenants,
we must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the
use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and
waste products.  Failure to comply with,
or changes in, these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business or
our tenants’ businesses and their ability to make rental payments to us.

Our properties may have
defects that are unknown to us.

Although we review the
physical condition of our properties before they are acquired, and on a
periodic basis after acquisition, any of our properties may have characteristics
or deficiencies unknown to us that could adversely affect the property’s value
or revenue potential.

We may incur significant
costs complying with the Americans With Disabilities Act and similar laws.

Under the Americans With
Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation and/or commercial facilities
are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled
persons.  We may be required to make
substantial capital expenditures at our properties to comply with this law.  In addition, non-compliance could result in
the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.

A number of additional
federal, state and local laws and regulations exist regarding access by
disabled persons.  These regulations may
require modifications to our properties or may affect future renovations.  This may limit the overall returns on our
investments.

We may incur significant
costs if we fail to comply with laws or if laws change.

Our properties are subject
to many federal, state and local regulatory requirements and to state and local
fire, life-safety and other requirements. 
If we do not comply with all of these requirements, we may have to pay
fines to government authorities or damage awards to private litigants.  We do not know whether these requirements
will change or whether new requirements will be imposed.  Changes in these regulatory requirements
could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures.  These expenditures could have an adverse
effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

We could incur significant
costs complying with environmental laws.

Federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations may require us, as a current or prior owner
or operator of real estate, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic
substances or petroleum products released at or from any of our
properties.  The cost of investigating
and cleaning up contamination could be substantial and could exceed the amount
of any environmental remediation insurance coverage available to us.  In addition, the presence of contamination,
or the failure to properly clean it up, may adversely affect our ability to
lease or sell an affected property, or to borrow funds using that property as
collateral.

Under environmental laws and
regulations, we may have to pay government entities or third parties for
property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those
parties relating to contaminated properties regardless of whether we knew of or
caused the contamination.  Even if more
than one party may have been responsible for the


contamination, we may be held responsible for
all of the clean-up costs.  In addition,
third parties may sue us for damages and costs resulting from environmental
contamination or jointly responsible parties may contest their responsibility
or be financially unable to pay their share of such costs.

Environmental laws also
govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing
materials.  These laws may impose fines
and penalties on us for the release of asbestos-containing materials and may
allow third parties to seek recovery from us for personal injury from exposure
to asbestos fibers.  We have detected
asbestos-containing materials at some of our properties, but we do not expect
that they will result in material environmental costs or liabilities to us.

Environmental laws and
regulations also require the removal or upgrading of certain underground storage
tanks and regulate:

·

the discharge of storm water, wastewater and any water
pollutants;

·

the emission of air pollutants;

·

the generation, management and disposal of hazardous
or toxic chemicals, substances or wastes; and

·

workplace health and safety.

Many
of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of
their operations at our properties. 
Environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially
us, to liability resulting from these activities.  Environmental liabilities could also affect a
tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. 
We require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and
regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities.

Independent
environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental
assessments at all of our properties.  We
intend to use consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our
future acquisitions.  This type of
assessment generally includes a site inspection, interviews and a public
records review, but no subsurface sampling. 
These assessments and certain additional investigations of our
properties have not to date revealed any environmental liability that we
believe would have a material adverse effect on our business or results of
operations.

The
additional investigations have included, as appropriate:

·

asbestos surveys;

·

radon surveys;

·

lead surveys;

·

mold surveys;

·

additional public records review;

·

subsurface sampling; and

·

other testing.

Nevertheless,
it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed, nor
that assessments on future acquisitions will reveal, all environmental
liabilities.  Consequently, there may be
material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware that may result in
substantial costs to us or our tenants and that could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

Our properties may contain
or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could
lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs to remedy the problem.

When
excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold may
grow, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not
addressed over a period of time.  Some
molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. 
Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation,
chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological
contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria.  Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or
irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse
health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions.  As a result, the presence of significant mold
or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to
undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other
airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor
ventilation.  In addition, the presence
of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability
from our tenants, employees of our tenants and others if property damage or
health concerns arise.


We could incur significant costs
due to the financial condition of our insurance carriers.

We insure our properties
with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our
policies are put into effect. The financial condition of one or more of our
insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted
resulting in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. Their inability
to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. In
addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs
to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional
properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties.

Our insurance may not
adequately cover all potential losses.

If we experience a loss at
any of our properties that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our
insurance policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the affected
property and, possibly, future revenues from that property. In addition, we
could continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other
obligations related to the affected properties. 
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental
loss insurance with respect to our properties. 
We have obtained earthquake insurance for our properties because many of
them are located in the vicinity of active earthquake faults.  We also carry environmental remediation
insurance and have title insurance policies on all of our properties. We obtain
our title insurance policies when we acquire the property, with each policy
covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property.
Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than
the current value of the related property.

Our tenants are also
required to maintain comprehensive insurance, including liability and casualty
insurance, that is customarily obtained for similar properties. There are,
however, certain types of losses that we and our tenants do not generally
insure against because they are uninsurable or because it is not economical to
insure against them.  The availability of
coverage against certain types of losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold,
has become more limited and, when available, is at a significantly higher
premium cost. We cannot predict whether insurance coverage against terrorism or
toxic mold will remain available for our properties because insurance companies
may no longer offer coverage against such losses or, if offered, such coverage
may become prohibitively expensive. 
Many, but not all, of our properties are low-rise buildings. Toxic mold
has not presented any material problems at any of our properties.

Terrorist attacks may have
an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the
value of our assets.

Terrorist attacks such as those
that took place on September 11, 2001, could have a material adverse
impact on our business and operating results. Future terrorist attacks may
result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and
the value of our properties.  To the
extent that future terrorist attacks impact our tenants, their businesses
similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to
honor their lease obligations.

The loss of services of
any of our senior executive officers could adversely affect us.

We depend upon the services
of relatively few executive officers. 
The loss of services of any one of them may adversely affect our
business, financial condition and prospects. 
We use the extensive personal and business relationships that members of
our management have developed over time with owners of life science properties
and with major life science industry tenants. 
We cannot assure our stockholders that our senior executive officers will
remain employed with us.

If we fail to qualify as a
REIT, we would be taxed at corporate rates and would not be able to take
certain deductions when computing our taxable income.

If, in any taxable year, we
fail to qualify as a REIT:

·

we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable
income at regular corporate rates;

·

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions
to our stockholders in computing taxable income;

·

unless we were entitled to relief under the Internal
Revenue Code, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the
four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification; and

·

we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue
Code to make any distributions to our stockholders.

As
a result of any additional tax liability, we might need to borrow funds or
liquidate certain investments in order to pay the applicable tax.  Accordingly, funds available for investment
or distribution to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years involved.


Qualification as a REIT
involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results

,

and the determination of various factual matters and
circumstances not entirely within our control. 
There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of
these provisions.  Although we believe
that we have operated in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure
our stockholders that we are or will remain so qualified.

In addition, although we
are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our
ability to operate as a REIT, new legislation, regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations
of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax
consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our
stockholders.

We may
change our business policies without stockholder approval.

Our board of directors
determines all of our material business policies, with management’s input,
including those related to our:

·

status as a REIT;

·

incurrence of debt and debt management activities;

·

selective development, redevelopment and acquisition
activities;

·

stockholder distributions; and

·

other policies, as appropriate.

Our board of directors
may amend or revise these policies at any time without a vote of our
stockholders. A change in these policies could adversely affect our business
and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Failure to maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

Pursuant
to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by
management on internal control over financial reporting, including management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control.  Changes to our business will necessitate
ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes.  Internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatement because of its inherent limitations,
including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of
controls or fraud.  Therefore, even
effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our
internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved
controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially
harmed, and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be
a material adverse effect on our stock price.

Our business and operations would suffer in the
event of system failures.

Despite
system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of
a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our
systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including
computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters,
terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. 
Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our
operations could result in a material disruption to our business.  We may also incur additional significant
costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.

There are limits on the ownership of our capital stock under
which a stockholder may lose beneficial ownership of its shares and which may
delay or prevent transactions that might otherwise be desired by our
stockholders.

In order to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more
than 50% of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or
constructively, by five or fewer individuals or entities (as set forth in the
Internal Revenue Code) during the last half of a taxable year. Furthermore,
shares of our outstanding stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more
persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a
proportionate part of a shorter taxable year.

In order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other
reasons, our charter provides for an ownership limit, which prohibits, with
certain exceptions, direct or constructive ownership of shares of stock
representing more than 9.8% of the combined total value of our outstanding
shares of stock by any person, as defined in our charter. Our board of
directors, in its sole discretion, may or may not waive the ownership limit for
any person. However, our board of directors may not grant such waiver if, after
giving effect to such waiver, five individuals could beneficially own, in the
aggregate, more than 49.9%


of the value of
our outstanding stock. As a condition to waiving the ownership limit, our board
of directors may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an
opinion of counsel in order to determine our status as a REIT. Notwithstanding
the receipt of any such ruling or opinion, our board of directors may impose
such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with
granting a waiver.

Our charter further prohibits transferring shares of our stock if such
transfer would result in us being “closely held” under Section 856(h) of
the Internal Revenue Code or would result in shares of our stock being owned by
fewer than 100 persons.

The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares
of our common stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related
individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity.
A transfer of shares to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates
these limits, shall be void or shall be exchanged for shares of excess stock
and transferred to a trust, for the benefit of one or more qualified charitable
organizations designated by us. In that case, the intended transferee will have
only a right to share, to the extent of the transferee’s original purchase
price for such shares, in proceeds from the trust’s sale of those shares and
will effectively forfeit its beneficial ownership of the shares.  These
ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in
control that might involve a premium price for the holders of our common stock
or might otherwise be desired by such holders.

In
addition to the ownership limit, certain provisions of our charter and bylaws
may delay or prevent transactions that may be deemed to be desirable to our
stockholders.

As authorized by Maryland
law, our charter allows our board of directors to cause us to issue additional
authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to
classify or reclassify unissued shares of common or preferred stock without any
stockholder approval.  Our board of
directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could delay, defer
or prevent a transaction that might involve a premium price for our common
stock or for other reasons be desired by our common stockholders or that have a
dividend preference which may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on
our common stock.

Our charter permits the
removal of a director only upon a two-thirds vote of the votes entitled to be
cast generally in the election of directors, and our bylaws require advance
notice of a stockholder’s intention to nominate directors or to present
business for consideration by stockholders at an annual meeting of our
stockholders.  Our charter and bylaws
also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or
change in control that involves a premium price for our common stock or that
for other reasons may be desired by our stockholders.

External
factors may adversely impact the valuation of investments.

We hold equity
investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities
primarily involved in the life science industry.  The valuation of these investments is
affected by many external factors beyond our control, including, but not
limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable or
unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new
collaborative agreements.  Unfavorable
developments with respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on
the valuation of our investments.

We face risks associated with
short-term liquid investments.

We have significant cash balances that we invest in a
variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value
and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income.  From time to time, these investments may
include (either directly or indirectly) obligations (including certificates of
deposit) of banks, money market funds, Treasury bank securities and other
highly rated short-term securities. 
Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss
of principal.  Under certain circumstances
we may be required to redeem all or part of these securities or funds will be
redeemable at par value.  A decline in
the value of our investments or delay or suspension of our right to redeem may
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition and our ability to pay our obligations as they become due.


We have certain ownership
interests outside the United States that may subject us to different or greater
risks than those associated with our domestic operations.

We have four operating
properties and one development parcel in Canada and two development parcels in
China.  International development,
ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those
we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations.  These risks include but are not limited to:

·

adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for
foreign currencies;

·

any international currency gain recognized with
respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income
test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to
qualify and maintain our status as a REIT;

·

challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign
earnings;

·

changes in foreign political, regulatory and economic
conditions, including regionally, nationally, and locally;

·

challenges in managing international operations;

·

challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign
laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate
governance, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings;

·

differences in lending practices;

·

differences in languages, cultures and time zones; and

·

changes in applicable laws and regulations in the
United States that affect foreign operations.

Although our
international activities currently represent a relatively small portion of our
overall business, these risks could increase in significance which, in turn,
could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial
condition.

We
are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the
United States dollar and foreign currencies.

We have four operating
properties and one development parcel in Canada and two development parcels in
China.  Investments in countries where
the United States dollar is not the local currency are subject to international
currency risk from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the
United States dollar and the local currency. 
A significant decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar, Chinese
Renminbi, or other foreign currencies where we may have a significant
investment could materially affect our results of operations.  We may attempt to mitigate such effects by
borrowing in the local foreign currency in which we invest.  Any international currency gain recognized
with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross
income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order
to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

General

As of December 31,
2009, we had 156 properties containing approximately 11.8 million rentable
square feet of office/laboratory space. 
Excluding properties undergoing redevelopment and properties classified
as “held for sale,” our properties were approximately 94.1% leased as of December 31,
2009.  The exteriors of our properties
typically resemble traditional office properties, but the interior
infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science industry
tenants. These improvements typically are generic to life science industry
tenants rather than being specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we
believe that the improvements have long term value and utility and are usable
by a wide range of life science industry tenants. Generic infrastructure
improvements to our life science properties typically include:

·

reinforced concrete floors;

·

upgraded roof loading capacity;

·

increased floor to ceiling heights;

·

heavy-duty HVAC systems;

·

enhanced environmental control technology;

·

significantly upgraded electrical, gas and plumbing
infrastructure; and

·

laboratory benches.

As of December 31, 2009, we held a fee simple interest in each of
our properties, except for 19 properties that accounted for approximately 17%
of the total rentable square footage of our properties. Of the 19 properties,
we held three properties in the San Francisco Bay market, one property in the
Southeast market, two properties in the Suburban Washington, D.C. market and 13
properties in the Eastern Massachusetts market pursuant to ground leasehold
interests. See further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”

In addition, as of December 31,
2009, our asset base contained land parcels aggregating approximately 1.6
million developable square feet in Canada, New York City and San Francisco Bay
markets which we held pursuant to ground leasehold interests and two land
parcels aggregating approximately 547,000 rentable square feet in China which
we held pursuant to land usage rights.

As of December 31,
2009, we had 417 leases with a total of 342 tenants, and 74 of our 156
properties were single-tenant properties. 
Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have terms of three to
seven years, while the single-tenant building leases typically have initial
terms of ten to 20 years. As of December 31, 2009:

·

approximately 88% of our leases (on a rentable square
footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially
all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating
expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent, and, in
addition to our triple net leases, approximately 8% of our leases (on a
rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of
operating expenses;

·

approximately 93% of our leases (on a rentable square
footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either
fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price
index or other index; and

·

approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square
footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such
as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking
lot resurfacing), which we believe would typically be borne by the landlord in
traditional office leases.

Our
leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant
alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the
properties are reusable generic office/laboratory improvements and remain our
property after termination of the lease at our election. However, we are
permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant, at
its expense, remove certain non-generic improvements and restore the premises
to their original condition.


Location of properties

The locations of our properties are diversified among a number of life
science cluster submarkets.  The
following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2009, the total rentable
square footage, annualized base rent and encumbrances of our properties in each
of our existing markets (dollars in thousands):

_________________

(1)

Annualized base rent means the annualized
fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2009 (using rental
revenue computed on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP).  Amounts exclude spaces at properties totaling
approximately 575,152 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use
to office/laboratory space through redevelopment.

(2)

Certain properties are pledged as
security under our secured notes payable as of December 31, 2009.  See Schedule III – Consolidated Financial
Statement Schedule of Rental Properties and Accumulated Depreciation of
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial
Statement Schedules” for additional information on our properties, including
encumbered properties.  Excludes
approximately $47.2 million of encumbrances related to land held for future
development and construction in progress.


Value
Add Activities

The
following table summarizes our current and embedded future development and
redevelopment square footage including preconstruction projects.  Preconstruction projects include significant
value add projects undergoing important and substantial activities to bring
these assets to their intended use. 
These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up
development (which are projected to yield substantial revenues and cash flows)
and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of buildings.  Amounts are classified as construction in
progress as required under GAAP while construction activities are ongoing to
bring the asset to its intended use. 
When construction activities cease, the asset is transferred out of construction
in progress and classified as rental properties, net or land held for future
development.  Land held for future
development includes certain land parcels with improvements to the land,
including, grading, piles, foundations and other land improvements.

(1)

Includes approximately 410,000 rentable square feet related to our
  project in New York City and approximately 547,000 rentable square feet
  related to two ground-up development projects in China.

(2)

Excludes a parcel with approximately 442,000 rentable square feet in
  New York City that we have an option to ground lease for future development
  and a 924,000 developable square foot parcel in Edinburgh, Scotland that we
  have a long-term right to purchase.

(3)

Future redevelopment represents
  non-laboratory operating assets (office, industrial or warehouse uses) that
  will undergo conversion to office/laboratory through redevelopment.

Redevelopment

A key
component of our business model is redevelopment of existing office, warehouse
or shell space as generic office/laboratory space, including the conversion of
single tenancy space to multi-tenancy spaces or multi-tenancy spaces to single
tenancy space, that can be leased at higher rates.  As of December 31, 2009, we had
approximately 575,152 rentable square feet undergoing redevelopment at ten
projects.  In addition to properties
undergoing redevelopment, as of December 31, 2009, our asset base
contained embedded opportunities for a future permanent change of use to
office/laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating approximately 1.5
million rentable square feet.

The
following table summarizes total rentable square footage undergoing
redevelopment as of December 31, 2009:

As of December 31,
2009, our estimated cost to complete was approximately $93 per rentable square
foot for the 575,152 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use
to office/laboratory space through redevelopment.  Our final costs for these redevelopment
projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including construction
requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations and the amount of costs
funded by each tenant.


Development

Another key component of our business model is
ground-up development.  Our development
strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects where we expect to achieve
appropriate investment returns.  We
generally have undertaken ground-up development projects only if our investment
in infrastructure will be substantially made for generic, rather than tenant
specific, improvements. As of December 31, 2009, we had six parcels of
land undergoing ground-up development in the United States approximating
980,000 rentable square feet of office/laboratory space as summarized in the
table below.  We also have an embedded
pipeline for future ground-up development approximating 11.1 million
developable square feet of office/laboratory space.  Future ground-up/vertical development
projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high quality and/or
credit entities.

As of December 31, 2009, our estimated cost to complete the
approximately 980,000 rentable square feet undergoing ground-up development was
approximately $140 per rentable square foot. 
This estimate includes costs related to tenant infrastructure costs,
including requirements for executed leases with Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead
Sciences, Inc. and UCSF.  This
estimate also includes certain costs related to incremental investment by the
Company with incremental returns which are beyond the original estimated
investment anticipated at the beginning of each project.  Our final costs for these projects will
ultimately depend on many factors, including construction and infrastructure
requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations and the amount of costs
funded by each tenant.

A component of our business model also includes ground-up development
projects outside of the United States. We have the ability to develop up to
924,000 rentable square feet in Edinburgh, Scotland. We have a right to
purchase the land for this development over the next 13 years. We also have a
development site in Toronto, Canada for the ground-up development of a
multi-story building aggregating 763,000 rentable square feet. This parcel is
subject to a 99-year ground lease. We also have two development parcels in
China subject to land use rights. One development parcel is located in South
China where a two-building project aggregating 275,000 rentable square feet is
under construction.  The second
development parcel is located in North China where a two-building project
aggregating 272,000 rentable square feet is under construction. Our final costs
for these projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including
construction requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations and the
amount of costs funded by each tenant. 
Future ground-up/vertical development projects will likely require
significant pre-leasing from high quality and/or credit entities.


Tenants

Our life science properties are leased
principally to a diverse group of tenants, with no tenant being responsible for
more than 8.0% of our annualized base rent. 
The chart below shows annualized base rent by tenant business type as of
December 31, 2009:

ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

To our knowledge, no legal proceedings are pending against us, other
than routine actions and administrative proceedings, substantially all of which
are expected to be covered by liability insurance and which, in the aggregate,
are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR
REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “ARE.” On
February 24, 2010, the last reported sales price per share of our common
stock was $61.68, and there were approximately 257 holders of record of our
common stock (excluding beneficial owners whose shares are held in the name of Cede
& Co.). The following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales
prices per share of our common stock as reported on the NYSE and the
distributions paid by us with respect to our common stock for each such period:

Future distributions on our common stock will be
determined by and at the discretion of our board of directors and will be
dependent upon a number of factors, including actual cash available for
distribution, our financial condition and capital requirements, the annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.  To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we
must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable
income for the current taxable year, determined without regard to deductions
for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains.  Under certain circumstances, we may be
required to make distributions in excess of cash flow available for
distributions to meet these distribution requirements. In such a case, we may
borrow funds or may raise funds through the issuance of additional debt or
equity capital.  No dividends can be paid
on our common stock unless we have paid full cumulative dividends on our 8.375%
series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”)
and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. 
From the date of issuance of our preferred stock through December 31,
2009, we have paid full cumulative dividends on our Series C Preferred
Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.  We cannot assure our stockholders that we
will make any future distributions.

The tax treatment of distributions on common stock
paid in 2009 was as follows: (1) 98.8% ordinary dividend and (2) 1.2%
return of capital.  The tax treatment of
distributions on common stock paid in 2008 was as follows: (1) 81.1%
ordinary dividend, (2) 6.6% capital gain at 15%, and (3) 12.3% return
of capital.

in the table below include the retrospective impact of new accounting literature
adopted on January 1, 2009 related to accounting for and disclosure of
convertible debt, noncontrolling interests and participating securities.  Additionally, certain amounts for the years
prior to 2009 presented in the table below have been reclassified to conform to
the presentation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,

GAAP
  basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting
  and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome
  the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for
  real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of
  Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) established the measurement tool of
  Funds from Operations (“FFO”). Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely
  used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs. We believe that FFO is helpful to
  investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We
  compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of
  Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the “White Paper”)
  and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology
  for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not
  be comparable to such other REITs. The White Paper defines FFO as net income
  (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
  sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after
  adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While FFO is
  a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it
  should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in
  accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash
  flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a
  measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our
  cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. For a more detailed
  discussion of FFO, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
  Condition and Results of Operations - Funds From Operations.”


ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this
annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent
risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions and financial trends that
may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy, results of
operations and financial position. A number of important factors could cause
actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated
by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those
described below in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake
any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any
revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any
other document, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

Overview

We are a publicly traded REIT focused principally
on science-driven cluster formation. We are the leading provider of
high-quality environmentally sustainable real estate, technical infrastructure
services and capital to the broad and diverse life science industry.  Client
tenants include institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit
institutions), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, product, service
and translational entities, as well as government agencies.  Our operating
platform is based on the principle of “clustering,” with assets and operations
located in key life science markets.

2009 demonstrated the strength and durability of our core operations
providing office/laboratory space to the broad and diverse life science
industry.  Our core operating results were relatively steady for the year
ended December 31, 2009, during the continuing extraordinary and
unprecedented United States and worldwide economic, financial, banking and
credit market crisis, significant worldwide economic recession and the drastic
decline in consumer confidence and the consumer driven economy.  Financial systems throughout the world have
recently experienced significant periods of illiquidity with banks much less
willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers.

The economic, financial
and banking environment and consumer confidence have improved since the depth
of the crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009.  Even with the recent improvements, we remain
cautious regarding the economic, financial and banking environment.  We intend to continue to focus on the
completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating
approximately 575,152 rentable square feet and our existing active development
projects aggregating approximately an additional 980,000 rentable square feet.
Additionally, we intend to continue with preconstruction activities for certain
land parcels for future ground-up/vertical above ground development in


order to preserve and create value for these projects.  These important preconstruction activities
add significant value to our land for future ground-up development and are
required for the ultimate vertical construction of the buildings.  We also intend to be very careful and prudent
with any future decisions to add new projects to our active ground-up/vertical
developments.  Future ground-up/vertical
development projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high
quality and/or credit entities.  We also
intend to continue to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital
structure over a multi-year period. 
During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt
maturities.  We expect the source of
funds for construction activities and repayment of outstanding debt to be
provided over several years by opportunistic sales of real estate, joint
ventures, cash flows from operations, new secured or unsecured debt and the
issuance of additional equity securities, as appropriate. As of December 31,
2009, we had identified three assets as “held for sale,” which have been
classified in discontinued operations.

As of December 31, 2009, we had 156 properties containing
approximately 11.8 million rentable square feet of office/laboratory space
including approximately 575,152 rentable square feet of space undergoing a
permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment,
including the conversion of single tenancy space to multi-tenancy spaces or
multi-tenancy spaces to single tenancy space. 
As of that date, our properties were approximately 94.1% leased,
excluding spaces at properties undergoing redevelopment.  In addition, as of December 31, 2009,
our asset base contained properties undergoing ground-up development approximating
980,000 rentable square feet.

The following table is a summary of our properties as of December 31,
2009 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Annualized base rent means the annualized
fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2009 (using rental
revenue computed on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP).  Amounts exclude spaces at properties totaling
approximately 575,152 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use
to office/laboratory space through redevelopment.

(2)

Including spaces undergoing a permanent
change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment, occupancy as of
December 31, 2009 was approximately 89.4%.

Our primary sources of revenue are rental income and tenant recoveries
(consisting of reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities,
repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses from certain tenants)
from leases of our properties.  The
comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing
of our property development, redevelopment and acquisition activities.  Of the 156 properties owned as of December 31,
2008, two were acquired in 2008 (the “2008 Properties”), 15 in 2007, 119 prior
to 2007.  In addition, we completed the
development of one property in 2009, one property in 2007 (together with the 15
properties acquired in 2007, the “2007 Properties”) and 18 properties prior to
2007.  As a result of these development
and acquisition activities, as well as our ongoing redevelopment and leasing
activities, there have been significant increases in total revenues and
expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for
2009 as compared to 2008 as well as 2008 as compared to 2007.  Our operating expenses generally consist of
real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating
expenses.


Leasing

As of December 31, 2009, approximately 88% of our leases (on a
rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating
expenses, including increases thereto. 
In addition, approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square
footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses.  Additionally, approximately 91% of our leases
(on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain
capital expenditures, and approximately 93% of our leases (on a rentable square
footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either
fixed or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index.

The following table summarizes information with respect to the lease
expirations at our properties as of December 31, 2009:

(1)

Excludes three month-to-month leases for
approximately 2,000 rentable square feet.

Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and
reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If a tenant experiences a
downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable
to make timely payments under its lease. 
Also, if tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early, we
may not be able to re-lease the space. 
Even if tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or
new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions and
lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms.  Consequently, we could lose the cash flow
from the affected properties, which could negatively impact our business.  We may have to divert cash flow generated by
other properties to meet our mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other
expenses related to owning the affected properties.

Value Add
Activities

Construction in progress includes the following value add activities as
of December 31, 2009 (in thousands):

Amounts are classified as
construction in progress as required under GAAP while construction activities
are ongoing to bring the asset to its intended use.  When construction activities cease, the asset
is transferred out of construction in progress and classified as rental
properties, net or land held for future development.

A key component of our business model is our value add
redevelopment and development programs. 
These programs are focused on providing high quality generic
office/laboratory space to meet the real estate requirements and are reusable
by various life science industry tenants. 
Upon completion, each value add project is expected to generate
significant revenues and cash flows.  Our
redevelopment and development projects are generally in locations highly
desirable by life science entities which we believe results in higher occupancy
levels, longer lease terms and higher rental income and returns.   Redevelopment projects consist of the
permanent change in use of office, warehouse and shell space into generic
office/ laboratory space, including the conversion of single tenancy space to
multi-tenancy spaces or multi-tenancy spaces to single tenancy space. Our investment
in redevelopment projects generally range from $75-150 per square foot
depending on the nature of the existing building improvement and
office/laboratory design.  Development
projects consist of the ground-up development of generic office/laboratory facilities.
We also have certain significant value add projects undergoing important


and substantial preconstruction activities to bring
these assets to their intended use. These critical activities add significant
value for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate
vertical construction of buildings. 
Ultimately, these land parcels will provide valuable opportunities for
new ground-up construction projects.  The
projects will provide high quality facilities for the life science industry and
will generate significant revenue and cash flows for the Company.  See “Item 2. Properties” for additional
information and tables summarizing our properties undergoing redevelopment,
development and preconstruction activities as of December 31, 2009.

A component of our business model also includes
ground-up development projects in new markets and other unique projects.  We have two development parcels in China. One
development parcel is located in South China where a two-building project
aggregating approximately 275,000 rentable square feet is under construction.  The second development parcel is located in
North China where a two-building project aggregating approximately 272,000
rentable square feet is under construction. 
Additionally, other projects include construction related to site work,
plaza, park and underground parking at the Alexandria Center

TM

for Life
Science – New York City, a unique one-of-a-kind highly advanced
state-of-the-art urban science park in the city and in the adjoining future
building approximating 410,000 rentable square feet.

Our success with our redevelopment, development and preconstruction
projects depends on many risks that may adversely affect our business,
including those associated with:

·

negative worldwide economic, financial and banking
conditions;

·

worldwide economic recession and lack of confidence;

·

the seizure or illiquidity of credit markets;

·

national, local and worldwide economic conditions;

·

delays in construction;

·

budget overruns;

·

lack of availability and/or increasing costs of
materials;

·

commodity pricing of building materials and supplies;

·

financing availability;

·

changes in the life sciences, financial and banking
industries;

·

volatility in interest rates;

·

labor availability and/or strikes;

·

uncertainty of leasing;

·

timing of the commencement of rental payments;

·

changes in local submarket conditions;

·

delays or denials of entitlements or permits; and

·

other property development uncertainties.

In addition, redevelopment, development and preconstruction activities,
regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, typically require a
substantial portion of management’s time and attention.  This may distract management from focusing on
other operational activities.  If we are
unable to complete redevelopment, development and preconstruction projects
successfully, our business may be adversely affected.


Critical
accounting policies

Our discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP.  Our significant accounting
policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The preparation of
these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical
experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances.  Changes in estimates
could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of
operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry
analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance.  Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

REIT compliance

We have elected to
be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.  Qualification as a REIT involves the
application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.  We believe that our current organization and
method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated
under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to
qualify, as a REIT.  However, it is
possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would
not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us
to fail to qualify.

If we
fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay
federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our
taxable income at regular corporate rates. 
If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for
investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced
for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make
distributions to our stockholders.

Rental
properties, net, land held for future development and construction in progress

In December 2007,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new accounting literature
with respect to business combinations. 
We prospectively adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2009.  In accordance with the new guidance, we recognize
assets acquired (including the intangible value to above or below market
leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships and other intangible
assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in
an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date.  The value of tangible assets acquired is
based upon our estimation of value on an “as if vacant” basis.  The value of acquired in-place leases
includes the estimated carrying costs during the hypothetical lease-up period
and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases,
considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place
lease.

We
assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors,
including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and
capitalization rates and available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a
number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends and
market/economic conditions that may affect the property. We also recognize the
fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition
constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.  In addition, acquisition-related costs and
restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Prior to the adoption of the new
guidance related to business combinations, the purchase price was allocated
based upon relative fair values and acquisition-related costs on successful
acquisitions were capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of
the assets acquired.


The values
allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant
improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an
estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, the shorter of the term of
the respective ground lease or 40 years for buildings and building
improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the
estimated useful life for equipment.  The
values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the lives
of the related leases and recorded as either an increase (for below market
leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income.  The values of acquired in-place leases are
classified as leasing costs, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.

Rental properties,
land held for future development, construction in progress and intangibles are
individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate
that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is
less than the carrying amount. 
Impairment indicators for our rental properties, land held for future
development and construction in progress are assessed by project and include,
but are not limited to, significant fluctuations in estimated net operating
income, occupancy changes, construction costs, estimated completion dates,
rental rates and other market factors. 
We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market
information, historical operating results, known trends and market/economic
conditions that may affect the property and our assumptions about the use of
the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple
outcomes are under consideration.  Upon
determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recorded to
reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value.

Capitalization
of costs

We are
required to capitalize direct construction and development costs, including
predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs
directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment
or construction of a project. 
Capitalization of construction, development and redevelopment costs is
required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended
use.  Costs incurred after a project is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as
incurred.  Should development,
redevelopment or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes,
insurance and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for
capitalization and would be expensed as incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred.

We
also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing
activities.  These costs are amortized on
a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases.  Costs related to unsuccessful leasing
opportunities are expensed.

Accounting for investments

We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded
companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science
industry.  All of our investments in
publicly traded companies are considered “available for sale” and are recorded
at fair value.  Fair value has been
determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with
unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of total equity.  The classification of each investment is
determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is
reevaluated at each balance sheet date. 
The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific
identification method, with net realized gains included in other income.

Investments in privately held entities are generally
accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor
that we have virtually no influence over the entities’ operating and financial
policies.  Certain investments in
privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method when our
interest in the entity is not deemed so minor that we have virtually no
influence over the entities’ operating and financial policies. Under the equity
method of accounting, we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the
carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or
losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. Additionally,
we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity
to less than 10%.

Individual investments are evaluated for impairment
when changes in conditions exist that may indicate an impairment exists. The
factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not
limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects
for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives
and new collaborative agreements.  If
there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an
adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate its fair
value.  For all of our investments, if a
decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is
determined to be other-than-temporary, such investment is written down to its
estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings.  We use “significant other observable inputs”
and “significant unobservable inputs” to determine the fair value of privately
held entities.


Interest rate hedge agreements

We are exposed to
certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic
conditions.  We principally manage our
exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through
management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including
interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount,
sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate hedge
agreements.  Specifically, we enter into
interest rate hedge agreements to manage exposures that arise from business
activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash
amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  Our interest rate hedge agreements are used
to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or
expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on the
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). 
We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and
currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges.  Our objectives in using interest rate hedge
agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure
to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management
strategy.  Interest rate swap agreements
designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts
from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed rate payments over
the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the
underlying notional amount.  Interest rate cap agreements designated as
cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a
counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange
for an up-front premium.

We record our
interest rate hedge agreements on the consolidated balance sheets at their
estimated fair values with an offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized
gains/losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in total equity.  The accounting for changes in fair value
(i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has
been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on
the type of hedging relationship.  For
those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging
instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based up on the
exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a
net investment in a foreign operation. 
Our interest rate hedge agreements are considered cash flow hedges as
they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in
expected future cash flows.  Hedge
accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss
recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in
the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow
hedge.  All of our interest rate hedge
agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly effective” in reducing our
exposure to variable interest rates.  We
formally document all relationships between interest rate hedge agreements and
hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk
strategy.  We make an assessment at the
inception of each interest rate hedge agreement and on an ongoing basis to
determine whether these instruments are “highly effective” in offsetting
changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items.  The ineffective portion of each interest rate
hedge agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. While we intend to
continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify
as “highly effective,” the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used
as hedges would be reflected in earnings.

The fair value of
our interest rate hedge agreements is determined using widely accepted
valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected
cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of
the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable
market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities
(also referred to as “significant other observable inputs”).  The fair values of our interest rate swap
agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the
discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash
receipts.  The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of
future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest
rate curves.  The fair value of our interest rate cap agreement is
determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future
expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above
the strike rate of the interest rate cap agreement.  The variable interest
rate used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap
agreement is based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from
observable market interest rate curves and volatilities.  The fair value calculation also includes an
amount for risk of non-performance using “significant unobservable inputs” such
as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default,
which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our
interest rate hedge agreements. In adjusting the fair value of our interest rate
hedge agreements for the effect of non-performance risk, we have considered any
applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual
puts and guarantees.  These methods of
assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value
may never be realized.


Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries

Rental income from
leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives and other rent
adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease
terms.  We include amounts currently
recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, in deferred
rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Amounts received currently, but recognized as
income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts payable,
accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in our consolidated balance
sheets.  We commence recognition of rental
income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant
takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property.

Tenant recoveries
related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs
and maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the
period the applicable expenses are incurred.

We maintain an
allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our
tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease.  If a tenant fails to make contractual
payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in
future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and unrealized deferred
rent.  As of December 31, 2009 and
2008, we had no allowance for doubtful accounts.

Discontinued operations

A property is
classified as “held for sale” when all of the following criteria for a plan of
sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the
action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is
available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms
that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer, and
other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the
sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one
year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that
is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions
necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that
significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be
withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified
as “held for sale,” its operations, including any interest expense directly
attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our
consolidated statements of income and amounts for all prior periods presented
are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations.  A loss is recognized for any initial
adjustment of the asset’s carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in
the period the asset qualifies as “held for sale.”

Depreciation
of assets ceases upon designation of a property as “held for sale.”

Impact of
recently issued accounting standards

In January 2010,
the FASB issued an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) to address implementation
issues associated with the accounting for decreases in the ownership of a
subsidiary. The new guidance clarified the scope of the entities covered by the
guidance related to accounting for decreases in the ownership of a subsidiary
and specifically excluded in-substance real estate or conveyances of oil and
gas mineral rights from the scope. 
Additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures required for a
business combination achieved in stages and deconsolidation of a business or
nonprofit activity. The new guidance became effective for interim and annual
periods ending on or after December 31, 2009 and must be applied on a
retrospective basis to the first period that an entity adopted the new guidance
related to noncontrolling interests.  The
adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In January 2010,
the FASB issued an ASU to address diversity in practice related to the
accounting for a distribution to shareholders that offers them the ability to
elect to receive their entire distribution in cash or shares of equivalent
value with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that shareholders
can elect to receive in the aggregate. The new guidance clarifies that the
stock portion of a distribution to shareholders that allows them to elect to
receive cash or shares with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash
that all shareholders can elect to receive in the aggregate is considered a
share issuance that is reflected in earnings per share prospectively as opposed
to a stock dividend that is retroactively applied by restating shares
outstanding and earnings per share for all periods presented. The new guidance
became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 31,
2009 and must be applied on a retrospective basis.  The adoption of this new guidance did not
have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.


In June 2009,
the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the “Codification”)
as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to
be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP.  Rules and
interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are
also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  All guidance contained in the Codification
carries an equal level of authority.  The
Codification became effective for interim or annual financial periods ending
after September 15, 2009.  The
adoption of the Codification did not have an impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In June 2009,
the FASB issued new accounting literature with respect to the consolidation of
variable interest entities (“VIEs”).  The
new guidance impacts the consolidation guidance applicable to VIEs and among
other things require a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to
determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, continuous assessments of whether a
company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and enhanced disclosures about a
company’s involvement with a VIE.  The
new guidance applies to our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2010 and
early adoption is prohibited.  We are
currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated
financial statements.

In May 2009, the FASB issued new accounting
literature with respect to subsequent events. 
The new guidance, among other things, clarifies accounting for and
disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before
financial statements are issued or available to be issued.  We adopted the new guidance effective April 1,
2009 and the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Results of operations

Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008

Rental revenues
increased by $25.1 million, or 7%, to $366.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2009 compared to $341.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The increase resulted from rental revenue
from properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1,
2008 and increases in rental rates related to renewed and/or releasable space
leased.  Additionally, in 2009 and 2008, we recognized
additional rental income aggregating $18.5 million and $11.3 million,
respectively, primarily related to a modification of a lease for a property in
South San Francisco, California.

Tenant recoveries
increased by $2.8 million, or 3%, to $102.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2009 compared to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The increase resulted primarily from
properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1,
2008.  As of December 31, 2009 and
2008, approximately 88% and 89%, respectively, of our leases (on a rentable
square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other
operating expenses, including increases thereto.

Other income for
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $11.8 million and $11.2
million, respectively, represents construction management fees, interest,
investment income and storage income. 
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 also includes a
$7.2 million cash payment related to real estate acquired in November 2007.  Excluding this cash payment, the decrease in
other income is primarily due to decreases in investment income for the year
ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2008.

Rental operating
expenses increased by $8.5 million, or 8%, to $120.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009 compared to $112.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2008.  The increase resulted primarily
from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily payroll, property taxes
and insurance) from properties placed in service or redeveloped during the
periods after January 1, 2008.  The
majority of the increase in rental operating expenses was recoverable from our
tenants.

General and
administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 4%, to $36.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $34.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2008.  As a
percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for 2009
remained consistent with 2008 at approximately 8%.

Interest expense
decreased by $2.8 million, or 3%, to $81.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2009 compared to $84.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The decrease resulted from a decrease in
LIBOR rates and a decrease in the outstanding balance on our unsecured line of
credit partially offset by the issuance of our 8% unsecured convertible
notes.  The weighted average interest
rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, including the impact
of our interest rate hedge agreements, decreased from approximately 4.30% as of
December 31, 2008 to approximately 4.10% as of December 31,
2009.  We have entered into certain
interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable
interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan (see “– Liquidity and Capital Resources – Interest Rate
Hedge Agreements”).


Depreciation and
amortization increased by $10.5 million, or 10%, to $116.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2009 compared to $106.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2008.  The increase resulted primarily
from depreciation associated with the improvements and properties placed in
service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2008.

During 2009, we
recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $11.3
million related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately
$75 million (par value) of certain of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes.

During 2008, we
recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $13.3 million associated
with other-than-temporary declines in the value of certain investments below
their carrying value.

Income from
discontinued operations, net of approximately $5.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2009 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were
classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2009 and four properties
sold during 2009.  In connection with the
properties sold in 2009, we recorded a gain of approximately $2.6 million.  Income from discontinued operations, net of
approximately $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects
the results of operations of three properties that were classified as “held for
sale” as of December 31, 2009, four properties sold during 2009 and eight
properties sold during 2008.  In
connection with the properties sold in 2008, we recorded a gain of approximately
$20.4 million.  We also recorded a
non-cash impairment charge of $4.7 million in March 2008 related to an
industrial building located in a suburban submarket south of Boston and an
office building located in the San Diego market which has been included in
income from discontinued operations, net. 
These properties were sold later in 2008.

Comparison of the year ended December 31,
2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007

Rental revenues
increased by $47.6 million, or 16%, to $341.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2008 compared to $293.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The increase resulted from rental revenue
from properties acquired, placed in service or redeveloped during the periods
after January 1, 2007 and increases in rental rates related to renewed
and/or releasable space leased.   Additionally, during the year ended December 31,
2008, we recognized additional rental income aggregating $11.3 million
primarily related to a modification of a lease for a property in South San
Francisco, California.

Tenant recoveries
increased by $19.1 million, or 24%, to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2008 compared to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The increase resulted primarily from properties
acquired, placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1,
2007.  As of December 31, 2008 and
2007, approximately 89% and 88%, respectively, of our leases (on a rentable
square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other
operating expenses, including increases thereto.

Other income for
the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $11.2 million and $14.7
million, respectively, represents construction management fees, interest,
investment income and storage income.  As
a percentage of total revenues, other income for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007 remained relatively consistent at approximately 2% to 4% of total
revenues.

Rental operating
expenses increased by $17.1 million, or 18%, to $112.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2008 compared to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2007.  The increase resulted primarily
from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily property taxes and
utilities) from properties acquired, placed in service or redeveloped during
the periods after January 1, 2007.  The
majority of the increase in rental operating expenses was recoverable from our
tenants.

General and
administrative expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 8%, to $34.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $32.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to the growth in both the depth and
breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including internationally. As a
percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2008 remained consistent with the year ended December 31,
2007 at approximately 8%.

Interest expense
decreased by $8.2 million, or 9%, to $84.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2008 compared to $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The decrease resulted primarily from a
decrease in outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit due to the
issuance of 10.0 million shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock in March and April 2008. 
Additionally, the decrease resulted from a decrease in LIBOR rates.  These decreases were partially offset by
increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit.  These borrowings were utilized to finance the
development, redevelopment and acquisition of the 2007 Properties and 2008
Properties.  The weighted average
interest rate


on our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan, including the impact of our interest rate hedge
agreements, decreased from approximately 5.85% as of December 31, 2007 to
approximately 4.30% as of December 31, 2008.  We have entered into certain interest rate
hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates
primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
(see “– Liquidity and Capital Resources – Interest Rate Hedge Agreements”).

Depreciation and
amortization increased by $13.5 million, or 15%, to $106.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2008 compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2007.  The increase resulted primarily
from depreciation associated with the improvements and properties acquired,
placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2007.

During 2008, we
recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $13.3 million associated
with other-than-temporary declines in the value of certain investments below
their carrying value.

Income from discontinued operations, net of $19.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the results of
operations of three properties that were classified as “held for sale” as of December 31,
2009, four properties sold in 2009 and eight properties sold during 2008.  In connection with the properties sold in
2008, we recorded a gain of approximately $20.4 million.  We also recorded a non-cash impairment charge
of $4.7 million in March 2008 related to an industrial building located in a
suburban submarket south of Boston and an office building located in the San
Diego market, which has been included in income from discontinued operations,
net.  These properties were sold later in
2008.  Income from discontinued
operations, net of $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
reflects the results of operations of three properties that were classified as “held
for sale” as of December 31, 2009, four properties sold in 2009, eight
properties sold during 2008, and four properties and four land parcels sold
during 2007.  In connection with the
properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a
gain of approximately $8.0 million.


Liquidity and capital
resources

Overview

We expect to
continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally
through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities.  We believe that the net cash provided by
operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make
distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT.  We also believe that net cash provided by
operating activities will be sufficient to fund recurring non-revenue enhancing
capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.

We expect to meet
certain long term liquidity requirements, such as for property development, redevelopment
and other construction projects, scheduled debt maturities and non-recurring
capital improvements, through net cash provided by operating activities,
periodic asset sales, long term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including
borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and the
issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.

Notwithstanding
our expectations, financial markets have recently experienced unusual
volatility and uncertainty. While this condition has occurred initially within
the “subprime” mortgage lending sector of the credit market, financial systems
throughout the world have recently highlighted significant periods of
illiquidity with banks much less willing to lend substantial amounts to other
banks and borrowers. Consequently, there is greater uncertainty regarding our
ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing or capital
on reasonable terms or at any terms. Our ability to finance our development and
redevelopment projects and pending or new acquisitions, as well as our ability
to refinance debt maturities, could be adversely affected by our inability to
secure capital on reasonable terms, if at all. 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We May Not Be Able to Obtain
Additional Capital to Further Our Business Objectives” and “ - We May Not
Be Able to Refinance Our Debt.”

The current
economic, financial and banking environment, worldwide economic recession and
lack of consumer confidence have improved since the fourth quarter of 2008 and
first quarter of 2009.  Even with the
recent improvements, we remain cautious over the economic, financial and
banking environment.  We intend to
continue to focus on the completion of 
our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating approximately
575,152 rentable square feet and our existing active development projects
aggregating approximately an additional 980,000 rentable square feet.
Additionally, we intend to continue with preconstruction activities for certain
land parcels for future ground-up/vertical above ground development in order to
preserve and create value for these projects. 
These important preconstruction activities add significant value to our
land for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate
vertical construction of the buildings. 
We also intend to be very careful and prudent with any future decisions
to add new projects to our active ground-up/vertical developments.  Future ground-up/vertical development
projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high quality and/or
credit entities.  We also intend to
continue to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital structure over a
multi-year period.  During this period,
we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt maturities.  We expect the source of funds for
construction activities and repayment of outstanding debt to be provided over
several years by cash flows from operations, opportunistic sales of real
estate, joint ventures, new secured or unsecured debt and the issuance of
additional equity securities, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2009, we
had identified three assets as “held for sale,” that have been classified in
discontinued operations.


As further discussed below, our principal liquidity needs
are to fund:

·

normal
recurring expenses;

·

current
development and redevelopment costs;

·

capital
expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs;

·

principal
and interest payments due under our debt obligations, including balloon
payments of principal; and

·

dividend
distributions in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal
Revenue Code.

We believe that our sources of capital for our principal
liquidity needs will be satisfied by:

·

cash
on hand of approximately $70.6 million as of December 31, 2009;

·

restricted
cash

of approximately $24.1 million as
of December 31, 2009 to fund certain construction costs;

·

cash
flows generated by operating activities (for the year ended December 31,
2009, we generated approximately $206.0 million of cash flows from operating
activities);

·

availability
under our $1.9 billion unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
(approximately $1.2 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2009);

·

cash
proceeds from new secured or unsecured financings;

·

cash
proceeds generated from potential asset sales including three properties that
were classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2009;

·

cash
proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred equity or debt securities;
and

·

cash
proceeds from joint ventures.

Principal liquidity needs

Contractual obligations and commitments

Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009
consisted of the following (in thousands):

(1)

Assumes we exercise our sole right to
extend the maturity dates of a secured note payable of approximately $28.5
million from January 1, 2011 to January 1, 2012, and a secured note payable of
approximately $38.4 million from January 2, 2012 to April 6, 2013.  Amounts include noncontrolling interests’
share of scheduled principal maturities of approximately $39.3 million, of
which approximately $17.6 million and $20.8 million mature in 2013 and 2014,
respectively.  Also, amounts are net of
unamortized discounts of approximately $2.1 million.

(2)

Assumes we exercise our sole right to
extend the maturity date of our unsecured line of credit from October 2010
to October 2011 and our unsecured term loan from October 2011 to October 2012.

Secured notes
payable as of December 31, 2009 consisted of 26 notes secured by 57
properties and one land development parcel. 
Our secured notes payable require monthly payments of principal and
interest and had weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.83% at December 31,
2009.  Noncontrolling interests’ share of
secured notes payable aggregated approximately $39.3 million as of December 31,
2009.  The total book values of rental
properties, net, land held for future development and construction in progress
securing debt were approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009.  At December 31, 2009, our secured notes
payable were comprised of approximately $831.5 million and $105.5 million of
fixed and variable rate debt, respectively.


Our unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010
and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2011.
Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our
sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2012.

In April 2009, we completed a private offering of
$240 million principal amount of 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes.  In January 2007, we completed a private
offering of $460 million principal amount of 3.70% Unsecured Convertible
Notes.  In April 2009, we
repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, approximately $75 million
(par value) of certain of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes.  See additional information under Note 7 to
our consolidated financial statements

appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K

regarding our ability to redeem the notes, the ability of the holders to
require us to repurchase the notes and circumstances under which the holders
may convert the notes.

Estimated interest payments on our fixed rate debt and
hedged variable rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest
rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment
dates and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2009, approximately
83% of our debt was fixed rate debt or variable rate debt subject to interest
rate hedge agreements. See additional information regarding our interest rate
hedge agreements under “Liquidity and Capital Resources

—

Interest Rate Hedge Agreements.”  The remaining 17% of our debt is unhedged
variable rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged
variable rate debt have been excluded from the table on the prior page because
we cannot reasonably determine the future interest obligations on variable rate
debt as we cannot predict the applicable variable interest rates in the
future.  See additional information
regarding our debt under Notes 5, 6, 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial
statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2009
included leases for 19 of our properties and three land development
parcels.  These lease obligations have
remaining lease terms from 23 to 97 years, excluding extension options.

In addition to the
above, as of December 31, 2009, remaining aggregate costs under contracts
for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment and generic
office/laboratory infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases
approximated $186.8 million.  We expect
payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to
capital planning adjustments from time to time. 
We are also committed to fund approximately $48.3 million for certain
investments over the next six years.

Capital
expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs

As of December 31, 2009, we had an aggregate of
approximately 980,000 rentable square feet undergoing vertical ground-up
construction and an aggregate of approximately 575,152 rentable square feet
undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through
redevelopment including the conversion of single tenancy space to multi-tenancy
spaces or multi-tenancy spaces to single tenancy space.

For the years ended

December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we
paid property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements related to
our properties, including expenditures related to our development and
redevelopment projects, aggregating approximately $446.1 million, $542.5
million and $589.7 million, respectively. 
These amounts include payments for property-related capital expenditures
and tenant improvements presented in the table below including non-revenue
enhancing capital expenditures and tenant improvement and leasing costs related
to re-tenanted and renewal space.  We
expect our future property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements
related to our life science properties to decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009.


The following
table shows total and the five-year average per square foot property-related
capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs (excluding capital
expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants,
revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment)
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

(1)

Property-related
  capital expenditures include all major capital and recurring capital
  expenditures except capital expenditures that are recoverable from tenants,
  revenue-enhancing capital expenditures or costs related to the redevelopment
  of a property. Major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and
  HVAC systems that are typically identified and considered at the time a
  property is acquired.

(2)

Excludes
  space that has undergone redevelopment before re-tenanting.

Capital
expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent and timing
of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our
tenants. As of December 31, 2009 approximately 91% (on a rentable square
footage basis) of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital
expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof
replacement and parking lot resurfacing). 
In addition, we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at
each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures.

Tenant
improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon
factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property age, location and
characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or re-tenanted space) the
involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market
conditions.

We expect our
future capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs (excluding
capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants,
revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment)
to be approximately in the range as shown in the table immediately above.


Unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan

We use our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital,
construction activities and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Our
$1.9 billion unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion in
unsecured line of credit and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the
future elect to increase commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by
up to an additional $500 million. As of December 31, 2009, we had
borrowings of $476 million and $750 million outstanding under our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan, respectively, with a weighted average
interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, of
approximately 4.10%.

Our unsecured line
of credit and unsecured term loan, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate
based on our election of either (1) a LIBOR-based rate plus 1.00% to 1.45%
depending on our leverage or (2) the higher of a rate based upon Bank of
America’s prime rate plus 0.0% to 0.25% depending on our leverage and the
Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%.  For each
LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six
months. Our unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010 and may be
extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2011.
Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our
sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2012.

Our unsecured line
of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial covenants, including, among
others, the following (as defined under the terms of the agreement):

·

leverage ratio less than 65.0%;

·

fixed charge coverage ratio greater than 1.40;

·

minimum book value of $1.6 billion; and

·

secured debt ratio less than 55.0%.

As of December 31, 2009, we believe our two most restrictive
financial covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
are the leverage and fixed charge ratios. 
Future changes in interest rates, our outstanding debt balances and
other changes in our business, operations or financial statements may result in
a default of these and other financial covenants under our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan.

In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit and unsecured
term loan restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness,
distributions, mergers, developments, land and borrowings available under our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan for developments, land and
encumbered assets.  As of December 31,
2009 and 2008, we were in compliance with all such covenants.  Management continuously monitors the Company’s
compliance and projected compliance with the covenants.  Our current expectation is that we will
continue to meet requirements of our debt covenants in the short and long
term.  However, in the event of a
continued economic slow-down, continued crisis in the credit markets and rising
cost of capital, there is no certainty that we will be able to continue to
satisfy all of the covenant requirements.

Aggregate unsecured borrowings may be limited to an amount based
primarily on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered
properties and our cost basis of development assets and land.  Aggregate unsecured borrowings may increase
as we complete the development, redevelopment, or acquisition of additional unencumbered
properties.  As of December 31,
2009, aggregate unsecured borrowings were limited to approximately $2.8
billion. If net operating income from properties supporting our borrowing
capacity under our unsecured credit facilities decreases, our borrowing
capacity under our credit facilities will also decrease. Additionally, we may
be required to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in
order to maintain compliance with one or more covenants under our credit
facilities.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 49 lenders providing
commitments under our $1.9 billion unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan. During 2009, all lenders under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured
term loan funded all borrowings requested under these agreements. In the future,
if one or more such lenders fail to fund a borrowing request, we may not be
able to borrow funds necessary for working capital, construction activities,
dividend payments, debt repayment and monthly debt service and other recurring
capital requirements. The failure of one or more lenders to fund their share of
a borrowing request may have a material impact on our financial statements.

We have risks associated with the maturity of our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan. There may be fewer, if any, lenders willing to
participate in future unsecured credit facilities and future commitments from
lenders may be lower than existing commitments. 
In addition, key terms and covenants may be less favorable than existing
key terms and covenants and we may not be able to raise capital to repay our
outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facilities prior to or at maturity.


Interest rate
hedge agreements

We utilize interest rate
hedge agreements, including interest rate swap and cap agreements, to hedge a
portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with
our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed
and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying
principal amount (the “notional amount”). 
Interest received under all of our interest rate hedge agreements is
based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The
net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected
as an adjustment to interest expense.

The following table
summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2009
(dollars in thousands):

We have entered into
master derivative agreements with each counterparty.  These master derivative agreements (all of
which are adapted from the standard International Swaps & Derivatives
Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between the Company and each
counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest
rate hedge agreements.  In order to limit
our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest
rate hedge agreements, our interest rate hedge agreements are spread among
various counterparties.  As of

December 31, 2009

,
the largest aggregate notional amount with an individual counterparty was $175
million.  If one or more of our
counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate hedge agreements, we may
incur higher costs associated with our variable rate LIBOR-based debt than the
interest costs we originally anticipated.

As of

December 31

,
2009, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in accounts payable,
accrued expenses and tenant security deposits based upon their respective fair
values aggregating a liability balance of approximately $49.9 million with the
offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized losses in accumulated other
comprehensive loss in total equity. 
Balances in accumulated other comprehensive loss are recognized in
earnings in the period that the forecasted hedge transactions affect
earnings.  Also, during the year ended

December 31

,
2009, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount
approximating $38.4 million effective May 15, 2009 and terminating on January 3,
2012.  This agreement sets a ceiling on
one-month LIBOR at 2.50% related to one secured note.  The interest rate cap agreement was
classified in other assets based upon its fair value aggregating an asset
balance of approximately $189,000.  We
have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate hedge
agreements.  For the year ended

December 31

,
2009, approximately $37.5 million was reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to interest expense as an increase to interest
expense.  During the next twelve months,
we expect to reclassify approximately $28.6 million from accumulated other
comprehensive loss to interest expense as an increase to interest expense.


Secured notes payable

As of December 31,
2009, we had aggregate secured notes payable of approximately $937.0 million.
If we are unable to refinance, extend principal payments due at maturity or pay
principal maturities with proceeds from other capital sources, then our cash
flows may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay
debt upon maturity. Furthermore, even if we are able to refinance debt prior to
maturity, the interest rate, loan to value and other key loan terms may be less
favorable than existing loan terms.  Less
favorable loan terms, assuming we are able to refinance our secured notes
payable, may result in higher interest costs, additional required capital as a
result of less proceeds or lower loan to value upon refinancing and new or more
restrictive covenants or loan terms.

Dividends

We are required to
distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to
continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not
contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred and
common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities.  All such distributions are at the discretion
of our board of directors.  We may be
required to use borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, if necessary, to
meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status.  We consider market factors and our
performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution
levels.  During the year ended December 31,
2009, we paid dividends on our common stock aggregating approximately $86.7
million.  Also, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we paid
dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock aggregating approximately $10.9 million and $17.5 million,
respectively.

Sources of capital

Cash and cash equivalents

As
of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $70.6 million of cash and cash
equivalents.

Tenant security
deposits and other restricted cash

Tenant security deposits
and other restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):

The
funds held in escrow related to construction projects will be used to pay for
certain construction costs.

Cash flows

Net cash provided by
operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $49.9
million to $206.0 million compared to $255.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2008.  The decrease resulted primarily
from a decrease in cash flows from overall changes in operating assets and
liabilities partially offset by an increase in net income.

Cash flows from operations are primarily
dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental
rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent and operating
escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and
other costs.  We believe our cash flows
from operating activities provide a stable source of cash to fund operating
expenses.  In addition, as of December 31,
2009,

approximately 88% of our leases (on a rentable
square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and
other operating expenses, including increases thereto, and approximately 8% of
our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a
majority of operating expenses.

We are largely dependent
on the life science industry for revenues due under lease agreements.  Our business could be adversely affected if
the life science industry is impacted by the current economic downturn and
financial and banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the
United States to other countries.  Our
tenants may not be able to pay amounts due under their lease agreements if they
are unsuccessful in discovering, developing, making or selling their products
or technologies.


The bankruptcy or
insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a
property.  If any of our tenants becomes
a debtor in a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code, the bankruptcy court
must approve any eviction.  The bankruptcy
court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us.  Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid
future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be
substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant’s
lease.  Any shortfall in rent payments
could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to
our stockholders.

Net cash used in
investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $409.9
million compared to $494.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The decrease in net cash used in investing activities reflects lower proceeds
from dispositions as well as lower additions to properties due to our strategy
to reduce capital spending in 2009 as compared to 2008.

Net cash provided by
financing activities for the year ended

December 31

, 2009
decreased by $98.8 million to $203.4 million compared to $302.2 million for the
year ended

December 31

,
2008.  For the year ended

December 31

,
2009, proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion from the issuance of common stock,
the issuance of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes and borrowings from
secured notes payable and our unsecured line of credit were partially offset by
approximately $1.2 billion related to the repurchase of certain of our 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes, principal reductions related to repayments of
outstanding principal on our secured notes payable and repayments of borrowings
from our unsecured line of credit. 
Additionally, for the year ended

December 31

, 2009,
we paid dividends on our common and preferred stock of approximately $115.0
million.  For the year ended

December 31

,
2008, proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion from the issuance of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock and borrowings from secured notes payable and our
unsecured line of credit were partially offset by principal repayments of
approximately $0.9 billion related to outstanding amounts an our second notes
payable and unsecured line of credit. Additionally, we paid dividends on our
common and preferred stock of approximately $122.0 million during the year ended

December 31

,
2008.

Unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan

We use our unsecured line
of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital, construction
activities and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Our $1.9 billion
unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion unsecured line of credit
and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase
commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $500
million. As of December 31, 2009, we had borrowings of $476 million and
$750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact
of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately 4.10%.  See additional information regarding our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan on page 47.

Property
dispositions

During the year ended December 31,
2009, we sold four properties at an aggregate contract price of approximately $20.9
million. The net sales proceeds were initially used to repay outstanding
secured debt related to the properties sold or outstanding debt on our
unsecured line of credit. As of December 31, 2009, we had three properties
classified as “held for sale.”

Other resources
and liquidity requirements

Under our current shelf
registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we
may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt and other securities.  These securities may be issued from time to
time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions.

In September 2009,
we sold 4,600,000 shares of our common stock

in a follow-on offering (including shares issued
upon full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option)

.  The shares were issued at a price of $53.25
per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $233.5 million
(after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering costs).

In April 2009, we
completed a private offering of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes.  The net proceeds from this offering, after
initial purchasers’ fees and other offering costs, were approximately $233.0
million.  Prior to April 20, 2014,
we will not have the right to redeem the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes,
except to preserve our qualification as a REIT. 
On and after that date, we have the right to redeem the 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for
cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus
any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.  Holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible
Notes may require us to repurchase their notes, in whole or in part, on April 15,
2014, 2019 and 2024 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
repurchase date.


Holders of the 8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of
their notes upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, at a repurchase price
in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change
repurchase date.

At issuance, the
8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of
approximately 24.1546 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the
8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, representing a conversion price of approximately
$41.40 per share of our common stock. 
This initial conversion price represented a premium of 15% based on the
last reported sale price of $36.00 per share of our common stock on April 21,
2009.  The conversion rate of the 8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes is subject to adjustments for certain events,
including, but not limited to, certain cash dividends on our common stock in
excess of $0.35 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable
in shares of our common stock.  As of December 31,
2009, there was no change from the initial conversion rate of our 8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes.  Holders of
the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes may convert their notes prior to the
stated maturity date of April 15, 2029 only under the following
circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter
ending June 30, 2009, if the closing sale price of our common stock for
each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter
exceeds or is equal to 130% of the conversion price in effect on the last
trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the
five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading
day period (the “8.00% Unsecured Convertible Note Measurement Period”) in which
the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average conversion value
of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes during the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible
Note Measurement Period; (3) upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change; (4) if
we call the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes for redemption; and (5) at
any time from, and including, March 15, 2029 until the close of business
on the business day immediately preceding April 15, 2029 or earlier
redemption or repurchase.  Upon
conversion, holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes will receive cash,
shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, as the case may be, at
our election.  Pursuant to the accounting
literature related to convertible debt, at issuance of the 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes, we determined the effective interest rate of the notes to be
11.0%.

In March 2009, we
sold 7,000,000 shares of our common stock

in a follow-on offering

.  The shares were issued at a price of $38.25
per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $254.6 million
(after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering costs).

In March and April 2008,
we completed a public offering of 10,000,000 shares of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock.  The shares
were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of
approximately $242 million (after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other
offering costs).  The proceeds from this
offering were used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of
credit.  The dividends on our Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original
issuance.  We pay dividends quarterly in
arrears at an annual rate of $1.75 per share. 
Our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is
not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions, and we are
not allowed to redeem our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, except to
preserve our status as a REIT.  Investors
in our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock generally have no voting
rights.  On or after April 20, 2013,
we may, at our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically converted if the closing sale
price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds 150% of the
then-applicable conversion price of the Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the trading day immediately prior to our issuance of a press release
announcing the exercise of our conversion option.  Holders of our Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time,
convert some or all of their outstanding shares initially at a conversion rate
of 0.2477 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was
equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $100.93 per share of
common stock.  The conversion rate for
the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for
certain events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common
stock in excess of $0.78 per share per quarter and dividends on our common
stock payable in shares of our common stock. 
As of December 31, 2009, the Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock had a conversion rate of approximately 0.2480 shares of common stock per
$25.00 liquidation preference, which is equivalent to a conversion price of
approximately $100.81 per share of common stock.

In January 2007, we
completed a private offering of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes.  The net proceeds from this offering, after
underwriters’ discount, were approximately $450.8 million. Prior to January 15,
2012, we will not have the right to redeem the Notes, except to preserve our
qualification as a REIT.  On and after
that date, we have the right to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time, for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the redemption date.  Holders
of the Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes, in whole or in part, on January 15,
2012, 2017 and 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the
repurchase date.  Holders of the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of
their notes upon the


occurrence of a
Fundamental Change, at a repurchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to,
but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.  At issuance, the Notes had an initial
conversion rate of approximately 8.4774 common shares per $1,000 principal
amount of the Notes representing a conversion price of approximately $117.96
per share of our common stock.  This
initial conversion price represented a premium of 20% based on the last
reported sale price of $98.30 per share of our common stock on January 10,
2007.  The conversion rate of the Notes
is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to,
certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.74 per share per quarter
and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2009, the Notes had a
conversion rate of approximately 8.5207 common shares per $1,000 principal
amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately
$117.36 per share of our common stock.  Holders
of the Notes may convert their Notes into cash and, if applicable, shares of
our common stock prior to the stated maturity of the Notes only under the
following circumstances:  (1) the
Notes will be convertible during any calendar quarter after the calendar
quarter ending March 31, 2007, if the closing sale price of our common
stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading
days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar
quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day
of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) the Notes will be
convertible during the five consecutive business days immediately after any
five consecutive trading day period (the “Note Measurement Period”) in which
the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was equal to or
less than 98% of the average conversion value of the Notes during the Note
Measurement Period; (3) the Notes will be convertible upon the occurrence
of specified corporate transactions, including a change in control, certain
merger or consolidation transactions or the liquidation of the Company; (4) the
Notes will be convertible if we call the Notes for redemption; and (5) the
Notes will be convertible at any time from, and including, December 15,
2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15,
2027 or earlier redemption or repurchase. 
The Note Measurement Period is the five

consecutive
trading day period following a request by a holder of the Notes to convert his
Notes.  Pursuant to the accounting
literature related to convertible debt, at issuance of the 3.70% Unsecured
Convertible Notes, we determined the effective interest rate of the notes to be
5.96%.

We hold interests,
together with certain third parties, in a limited partnership and in limited
liability companies which we consolidate in our financial statements. These
third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to
their share of funds for construction and financing related activities.

Off-balance sheet arrangements

As
of December 31, 2009, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Exposure
to environmental liabilities

In connection with the
acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental
assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or
other issues.  The Phase I environmental
assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities
that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material
environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental
assessments were completed.  In addition,
we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to
certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

Inflation

As of December 31,
2009, approximately 88% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were
triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate
taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses,
including increases thereto.  In
addition, approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis)
required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. Approximately 93%
of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual
rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%)
or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we
do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are
subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation,
however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate
borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan.


Funds from operations

GAAP basis accounting for
real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate
values diminish over time.  In an effort
to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost
accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of NAREIT established
the measurement tool of FFO.  Since its
introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among
REITs.  We believe that FFO is helpful to
investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards
established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White
Paper (the “White Paper”) and related implementation guidance, which may differ
from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO is a relevant and widely used
measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an
alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication
of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it
indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to
make distributions (see “– Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Flows” above
for information regarding these measures of cash flow).

The following table
presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate
Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measure to FFO, to FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s
common stockholders (in thousands):

(1)

Includes
depreciation and amortization on assets “held for sale” reflected as
discontinued operations for the periods prior to when such assets were
classified as “held for sale.”

(2)

Gain
on sales of property relates to four properties sold during 2009 and eight
properties sold during 2008.  Gain on
sales of property is included in the consolidated statements of income in
income from discontinued operations, net.


ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the
exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and
foreign currency exchange rates.

Interest rate risk

The primary market risk
to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from
many factors, including government monetary and tax policies, domestic and
international economic and political considerations and other factors that are
beyond our control.

In order to modify and
manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt and to limit
the effects of interest rate risks on our operations, we may utilize a variety
of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other
interest rate exchange contracts.  The
use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes
in interest rates carries additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk
and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts.

Our future earnings and
fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon
prevalent market rates of interest, such as LIBOR.  However, our interest rate hedge agreements
are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate changes.  Based on interest rates at, and our interest
rate hedge agreements in effect on December 31, 2009 and 2008, we estimate
that a 1% increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt, including our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, after considering the effect
of our interest rate hedge agreements, would decrease annual future earnings by
approximately $2.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively.  We further estimate that a 1% decrease in
interest rates on our variable rate debt, including our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan, after considering the effect of our interest
rate hedge agreements in effect on December 31, 2009 and 2008, would
increase annual future earnings by approximately $2.4 million and $3.6 million,
respectively.  A 1% increase in interest
rates on our secured debt, unsecured convertible notes and interest rate hedge
agreements would decrease their aggregate fair values by approximately $67.8
million and $60.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  A 1% decrease in interest
rates on our secured debt, unsecured convertible notes and interest rate hedge
agreements would increase their aggregate fair values by approximately $57.5
million and $63.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

These amounts were
determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our
borrowing cost and our interest rate hedge agreements in effect on December 31,
2009 and 2008.  These analyses do not
consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that
could exist in such an environment. 
Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would consider
taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to
the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure.

Equity
price risk

We have exposure to
equity price market risk because of our equity investments in certain publicly
traded companies and privately held entities. 
We classify investments in publicly traded companies as “available for
sale” and, consequently, record them on our consolidated balance sheets at fair
value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income or loss. 
Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under
the cost method because we do not influence any of the operating or financial
policies of the entities in which we invest. 
For all investments, we recognize other-than-temporary declines in value
against earnings in the same period the decline in value was deemed to have
occurred.  There is no assurance that
future declines in value will not have a material adverse impact on our future
results of operations.  By way of
example, a 10% decrease in the fair value of our equity investments as of December 31,
2009 and 2008 would decrease their fair values by approximately $7.3 million
and $6.2 million, respectively.


Foreign
currency exchange rate risk

We have exposure to
foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our subsidiaries operating in
Canada and China.  The functional
currencies of our foreign subsidiaries operating in Canada and China are the
respective local currencies.  Gains or
losses resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ balance
sheets and income statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income as a separate component of total equity. 
Gains or losses will be reflected in our income statement when there is a
sale or partial sale of our investment in these operations or upon a complete
or substantially complete liquidation of the investment. Based on our current
operating assets outside the United States as of December 31,
2009, we estimate that a 10% increase in foreign currency exchange rates
relative to the United States dollar would increase annual future earnings
by approximately $746,000.  We further estimate that a 10%
decrease in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the United States
dollar would decrease annual future earnings by approximately $746,000.

Changes in internal
control over financial reporting

There
have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that could materially
affect, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Evaluation of disclosure
controls and procedures

As of December 31,
2009, we performed an evaluation, under the supervision of our Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These controls and procedures have been
designed to ensure that information required for disclosure is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods.  Based on our evaluation, the CEO and CFO
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
2009.


Management’s annual
report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting.  Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and effected by the Company’s board
of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.  The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of
the Company’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2009.  In making its
assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in “Internal
Control – Integrated Framework.” Management concluded that based on its
assessment, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2009. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
independent registered accounting firm, as stated in their report which is
included herein.


Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

We have audited Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s (the “Company”)
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of the Company

as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’
equity and noncontrolling interests,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2009 of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2010 an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9B. OTHER
INFORMATION

On March
1, 2010, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Executive Employment
Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Dean A. Shigenaga, the Company’s Chief
Financial Officer (the “Executive”).  The
Agreement amends and restates the Amended and Restated Executive Employment
Agreement, effective as of January 1, 2007, between the Company and the
Executive, in its entirety.  The term of
the Agreement begins on January 1, 2010 and ends on December 31, 2012, with
automatic one-year extensions thereafter subject to certain conditions.

The
Agreement provides for a base salary of $305,000 per year.  The Executive’s base salary is to be increased
in 2010 and each year thereafter by no less than a cost-of-living adjustment
based on an index published by the U.S. Department of Labor.  The Executive will continue to be eligible
for an annual bonus and periodic equity awards.

The
Agreement provides that if the Executive’s employment terminates due to
non-renewal of the Agreement by the Company on or following a change in control
of the Company, the Executive is entitled to receive severance generally equal
to one year of the Executive’s base salary and a bonus equal to the Executive’s
bonus for the previous year.  By
contrast, if, upon or within two years following a change in control of the
Company, the Company terminates the Agreement without cause or the Executive
terminates the Agreement for good reason, the Executive is entitled to receive
severance generally equal to two years of the Executive’s base salary and a
bonus equal to two times the Executive’s bonus amount for the previous
year.  In either situation, all of the
Executive’s unvested shares in the Company will vest on the Executive’s last
day of employment and the Executive will receive a proration of annual
performance-based grants of restricted stock.

The
Agreement also provides that if (a) the Agreement is not renewed by the Company
on or following a change in control of the Company, (b) the Company terminates
the Agreement without cause or (c) the Executive terminates the Agreement for
good reason, the Company will pay the applicable premiums for the Executive’s
continued coverage under the Company’s health insurance plans for up to twelve
months after the Executive’s last day of employment with the Company.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity and
noncontrolling interests, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15. These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 2009 the Company adopted FASB Staff

1.
Background

References to the “Company,”
“we,” “our” and “us” refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and
its subsidiaries.

Alexandria Real Estate
Equities, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in
1994.  We are focused principally
on science-driven cluster formation through the ownership, operation,
management and selective redevelopment, development and acquisition
of properties containing office/laboratory space.  Our properties are designed and improved for
lease primarily to institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit
institutions), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, product, service
and translational entities, as well as government agencies. As of December 31,
2009, we had 156 properties (152 properties located in ten states in the United
States and four properties located in Canada) containing approximately 11.8
million rentable square feet (including spaces undergoing active redevelopment),
compared to 159 properties (155 properties located in ten states in the United
States and four properties located in Canada) with approximately 11.8 million
rentable square feet (including spaces undergoing active redevelopment) as of December 31,
2008.

As of December 31,
2009, approximately 88% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were
triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes
and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including increases
thereto.  In addition, approximately 8%
of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay
a majority of operating expenses. 
Additionally, approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square
footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures and
approximately 93% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained
effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on the
consumer price index or another index. 
Any references to the number of buildings, square footage, number of
leases, occupancy and annualized base rent percentages in the notes to
consolidated financial statements are unaudited.

2.
Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alexandria Real
Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

We hold interests,
together with certain third parties, in a limited partnership and in limited
liability companies which we consolidate in our financial statements.  We consolidate the limited partnership and
limited liability companies because we exercise significant control over major
decisions by these entities, such as investment activity and changes in
financing.

For entities that are variable
interest entities (“VIEs”), we consolidate the entity if it is determined that
we are the primary beneficiary at either the creation of the VIE or upon
occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event.  A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where
either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a
controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is
insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional
subordinated financial support. 
Qualifying reconsideration events include, but are not limited to, the
modification of contractual agreements that affect the characteristics or
adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or
a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.  We use qualitative and quantitative
approaches when determining whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary
of a VIE.  Consideration of various
factors includes, but is not limited to, the form of our ownership interest,
our representation of the entity’s governing body, the size and seniority of
our investment, various cash flow scenarios related to the VIE, our ability to
participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to
participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and/or
liquidate the venture, if applicable. 
Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity
at inception of our involvement or upon a reconsideration event and determine
the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in
our consolidated financial statements. 
If we were to perform a primary beneficiary analysis upon the occurrence
of a future reconsideration event, our assumptions may be different, which
could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.  See Note 13, Noncontrolling Interests.

Use of estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Retrospective adjustments from
adoption of accounting pronouncements

In June 2008, the FASB
issued new accounting literature with respect to determining whether
instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating
securities.  The new guidance clarifies
that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating
securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share
pursuant to the two-class method.  The
new guidance was adopted on January 1, 2009. 
As a result, net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities,
Inc.’s common stockholders and earnings per share (basic and diluted) are
adjusted for an allocation of net income to unvested restricted stock awards,
including retrospective application to prior periods.  For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007, approximately $1.3 million, $1.3 million and $1.1 million,
respectively, of net income was attributable to unvested restricted stock
awards.

In May 2008, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued new accounting
literature with respect to the accounting for convertible debt instruments that
may be settled in cash upon conversion, including partial cash settlement.  On January 1, 2009, we adopted the new
guidance which affect our outstanding 3.70% unsecured convertible notes (“3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes”), that may be settled wholly or partially in
cash.  The new guidance, among other
things, requires that instruments within its scope be separated into their
liability and equity components as of the issuance date of the instrument by
recording the liability component at the fair value of a similar liability that
does not have an associated equity component and attributing the remaining
proceeds from issuance to the equity component. The excess of the principal
amount of the liability component over its initial fair value will be amortized
to interest expense using the effective interest method over a period of five
years through January 2012 (the first date the holders of the 3.70% Unsecured
Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase their notes).  As of the issuance date of the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes, we determined the effective interest rate of the
notes to be 5.96% and approximately $43.8 million of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible
Notes was classified as equity.  The new
guidance also requires retrospective application to prior periods.  For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007, we incurred additional non-cash interest expense related to our 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes, net of amounts capitalized, of approximately $3.5
million, $6.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively, as a result of adopting
the new guidance.

In December 2007, the
FASB issued new accounting literature with respect to the accounting for
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements.  The new guidance, among other things,
requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries within
equity in the consolidated financial statements, but separate from the parent
shareholders’ equity.  If noncontrolling
interests are determined to be redeemable, they are classified as temporary
equity and reported at an amount no less than the redemption value at each
balance sheet date.  The new guidance
also requires any acquisitions or dispositions of noncontrolling interests that
do not result in a change of control to be accounted for as equity
transactions.  In addition, the new
guidance requires that a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net income
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated upon a change in control.  Purchases or sales of an interest in an
entity that results in a change of control is recognized at fair value with
gains or losses included in net income. 
The new guidance was adopted on January 1, 2009 and applied
retrospectively to prior periods.  The
retrospective application of the presentation and disclosure requirements
resulted in a reclassification of noncontrolling interests determined not to be
redeemable to a separate component of total equity (including an allocation of
accumulated other comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests) and net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests is shown as a reduction from
net income in calculating net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate
Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders. 
The retrospective application of the presentation and disclosure
requirements of the new guidance did not impact net income attributable to
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders or earnings per
share for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies
(continued)

Fair value

We are required to
disclose fair value information about all financial instruments, whether or not
recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair
value. We measure and disclose the estimated fair value of financial assets and
liabilities utilizing a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between data
obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting
entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions.  This hierarchy consists of three broad levels
as follows: 1) using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities, 2) “significant other observable inputs” and 3) “significant
unobservable inputs.”  “Significant other
observable inputs” can include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or
liability, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that
are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 
“Significant unobservable inputs” are typically based on an entity’s own
assumptions, since there is little, if any, related market activity. In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on
inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in
its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the
fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors
specific to the asset or liability.

The carrying amounts of
cash and cash equivalents, tenant security deposits and other restricted cash,
tenant receivables, other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate fair value.  As described in
Note 8, our interest rate hedge agreements have been recorded at fair value.
The fair values of our secured notes payable, unsecured line of credit,
unsecured term loan and unsecured convertible notes were estimated using “significant
other observable inputs” such as available market information and discounted
cash flows analyses based on borrowing rates we believe we could obtain with
similar terms and maturities.  Because
the valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of
estimates, the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ
materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate.  Additionally, the use of different market
assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated
fair value amounts.  As of December 31,
2009 and 2008, the book and fair values of our secured notes payable, unsecured
line of credit, unsecured term loan and unsecured convertible notes were as
follows (in thousands):

Operating segment

We are engaged in the
business of providing office/laboratory space for lease to the life science
industry.  Our properties are similar in
that they provide space for lease to the life science industry, consist of
office/laboratory improvements that are generic and reusable for the life
science industry, are located in key life science cluster markets and have
similar economic characteristics. Our chief operating decision maker, reviews financial
information for our entire consolidated operations when making decisions on how
to allocate resources and in assessing our operating performance.  The financial information disclosed herein
represents all of the financial information related to our principal operating
segment.

International operations

The functional currency
for our subsidiaries operating in the United States is the United States
dollar.  We have four operating
properties and one development parcel in Canada and two development parcels in
China.  The functional currency for our
foreign subsidiaries operating in Canada and China is the local currency.  The assets and liabilities of our foreign
subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in
effect as of the financial statement date. 
Income statement accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated
using the average exchange rate for the periods presented.  Gains or losses resulting from the
translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a
separate component of total equity.

International
operations (continued)

The appropriate
amounts of foreign exchange rate gains or losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) will be reflected in income when there is a sale or
partial sale of our investment in these operations or upon a complete or
substantially complete liquidation of the investment.

Rental properties, net, land held
for future development, construction in progress and discontinued operations

In December 2007,
the FASB issued new accounting literature with respect to business
combinations.  This new accounting
literature was adopted prospectively beginning on January 1, 2009.  In accordance with the new guidance, we
recognize assets acquired (including the intangible values to above or below
market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships and other
intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition
date.  The value of tangible assets
acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an “as if vacant” basis.  The value of acquired in-place leases
includes the estimated carrying costs during the hypothetical lease-up period
and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases,
considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place
lease.

The
values of acquired in-place leases are classified as leasing costs, included in
other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amortized over
the remaining terms of the related leases. 
We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on
numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize
appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market
information.  Estimates of future cash
flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating
results, known trends and market/economic conditions that may affect the
property. We also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100%
interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired
entity.  In addition, acquisition-related
costs and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Prior to the adoption
of the new guidance related to business combinations, the purchase price was
allocated based upon relative fair values and acquisition-related costs on
successful acquisitions were capitalized and amortized over the estimated
useful lives of the assets acquired.

The values
allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant
improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an
estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, the shorter of the term of
the respective ground lease or 40 years for buildings and building
improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the
estimated useful life for equipment.

The values of
acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the terms of the
related leases and recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or
a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income.  For the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, we recognized a net increase in rental income of approximately
$9,448,000, $9,509,000 and $7,572,000, respectively, for the amortization of
acquired above and below market leases. The value of acquired above and below
market leases, less accumulated amortization, was approximately $27,746,000 and
$37,194,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The weighted average amortization period of
acquired leases was approximately 4.0 years as of December 31, 2009.  The estimated aggregate annual amortization
of acquired leases for each of the five succeeding years is approximately
$5,264,000 for 2010, $4,009,000 for 2011, $3,467,000 for 2012, $3,415,000 for
2013 and $3,323,000 for 2014.

During the year ended December 31,
2009, we recognized income of approximately $7,242,000 for a cash payment
related to real estate acquired in November 2007.  This amount is classified in other income on
the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

We are required to
capitalize construction, redevelopment and development costs, including
predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs
directly related and essential to the project while activities are ongoing to
prepare an asset for its intended use. 
Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for
its intended use are expensed as incurred. 
Should development, redevelopment or construction activity cease,
interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs would no longer be eligible
for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred.

F-11

2. Basis of presentation and summary of significant
accounting policies (continued)

Rental properties, net, land held for future development, construction
in progress and discontinued operations (continued)

We

classify a property as “held for sale”
when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management,
having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the
property; (2) the property is available for immediate sale in its present
condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (3) an
active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the
plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is
probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the property
is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation
to its current fair value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan
of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will
be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. 
When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as “held
for sale,” its operations, including any interest expense directly attributable
to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements
of income, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from
continuing operations to discontinued operations.  A loss is recognized for any initial
adjustment of the asset’s carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in
the period the asset qualifies as “held for sale.”

Depreciation
of assets ceases upon designation of a property as “held for sale.”

Rental properties,
net, land held for future development, construction in progress and intangibles
are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may
indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash
flows is less than the carrying amount. 
Impairment indicators for our rental properties, land held for future development
and construction in progress are assessed by project and include, but are not
limited to, significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income,
occupancy changes, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates
and other market factors.  We assess the
expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but
not limited to, construction costs, available market information, historical
operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions that may affect
the property and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if
necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under
consideration.  Upon determination that
an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying
amount to its estimated fair value. 
Based upon our evaluation, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge

of
approximately $4,650,000 during the year ended December 31, 2008 related
to an industrial building located in a suburban submarket south of Boston and
an office building located in the San Diego market. This non-cash impairment
charge is classified in income from discontinued operations, net, in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Conditional asset retirement obligations

Some of our
properties may contain asbestos which, under certain conditions, requires
remediation.  Although we believe that the asbestos is appropriately
contained in accordance with environmental regulations, our practice is to
remediate the asbestos upon the development or redevelopment of the affected
property.  We recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional
asset retirement obligation (including asbestos) when the fair value of the
liability can be reasonably estimated.  In addition, for certain properties,
we have not recognized an asset retirement obligation when there is an
indeterminate settlement date for the obligation because the period in which we
may remediate the obligation may not be estimated with any level of precision
to provide for a meaningful estimate of the retirement obligation. Conditional
asset retirement obligations totaled approximately $10.6 million and $10.9
million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are included
in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and cash equivalents

We consider all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when
purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. 
The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at major
commercial banks in accounts that may at times exceed the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limit of $250,000.  We have not experienced any losses to date on
our invested cash.

Investments

We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded
companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science
industry.  All of our investments in
publicly traded companies are considered “available for sale” and are recorded
at fair value.  Fair value has been
determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with
unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of total equity.  The classification of each investment is
determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is
reevaluated at each balance sheet date. 
The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific
identification method, with net realized gains included in other income.  Investments in privately held entities are
generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity
is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entities’ operating
and financial policies.  Certain
investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity
method when our interest in the entity is not deemed so minor and we are deemed
to have influence over the entities’ operating and financial policies. Under
the equity method of accounting, we record our investment initially at cost and
adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the
earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. As
of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our ownership percentages in the voting
stock of each individual privately held entity were under 10%.

Individual investments are evaluated for impairment
when changes in conditions exist that may indicate an impairment exists. The
factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not
limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects
for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives
and new collaborative agreements.  If
there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an
adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate its fair
value.  For all of our investments, if a
decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is
determined to be other-than-temporary, such investment is written down to its
estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings.  We use “significant other observable inputs”
and “significant unobservable inputs” to determine the fair value of privately
held entities.

Leasing costs

Costs directly
related and essential to our leasing activities are capitalized and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease.  Costs related to unsuccessful leasing
opportunities are expensed.  Leasing
costs, net of related amortization, totaled approximately $70,209,000 and
$60,147,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The value of acquired in-place leases are
included in the amounts immediately above and are classified as leasing costs,
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
amortized over the remaining term of the related lease.  The value of acquired in-place leases, net of
related amortization, was approximately $8,177,000 and $12,184,000 as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively.  The
estimated annual amortization of the value

of
acquired in-place leases for each of the five succeeding years is approximately
$2,528,000 for 2010, $1,689,000 for 2011, $1,101,000 for 2012, $925,000 for
2013 and $667,000 for 2014.

Loan fees and costs

Fees and costs
incurred in obtaining long term financing are amortized over the terms of the
related loans and included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.  Loan fees and
costs, net of related amortization, totaled approximately $23,706,000 and
$21,018,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are
included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Interest rate hedge agreements

We utilize
interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap and cap
agreements, to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates
primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan.  We recognize our interest rate hedge
agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair
value.  The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses)
of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and
qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging
relationship.  For those derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company
must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the hedged exposure, as a
fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation.  Our interest rate hedge
agreements are considered cash flow hedges as they are designated and qualify
as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows.  Hedge accounting generally provides for the
matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument
with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged
forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.

Accounts payable, accrued
expenses and tenant security deposits

As of December 31, 2009, accounts payable,
accrued expenses and tenant security deposits included interest rate swap liabilities
of approximately $49,946,000, accounts

payable and accrued
expenses of approximately $48,866,000, accrued construction costs of approximately
$36,856,000 and acquired below market leases of approximately $27,746,000.  As of December 31, 2008, accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits included interest rate swap
liabilities of approximately $80,542,000, accounts

payable and accrued
expenses of approximately $86,161,000, accrued construction costs of
$73,470,000 and acquired below market leases of approximately $37,194,000.

Rental income and tenant
recoveries

Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent,
incentives and other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the respective lease terms.  We
include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in
later years, in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.  Amounts received currently, but
recognized as income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in our consolidated
balance sheets.  We commence recognition
of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the
tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property.

Tenant recoveries
related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs
and maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the
period the applicable expenses are incurred.

We maintain an
allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants
to make payments required under the terms of the lease.  If a tenant fails to make contractual
payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in
future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and unrealized deferred rent.  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had
no allowance for doubtful accounts.

Interest
income

Interest income
was approximately $1,503,000, $1,763,000 and $1,916,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, and is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.

Income taxes

We are organized
and qualify as a REIT pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”).  Under the Code, a REIT
that distributes 100% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and
that meets certain other conditions is not subject to federal income taxes, but
could be subject to certain state and local taxes.  We generally distribute 100% or more of our
taxable income.  Therefore, no provision
for federal income taxes is required.  We
file tax returns, including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal, state
and local jurisdictions, including jurisdictions located in the United States,
Canada, China and other international locations.  Our tax returns are subject to examination in
various jurisdictions for the calendar years 2005 through 2009.

We recognize tax
benefits of uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the
tax position will be sustained, based solely on its technical merits, with the
taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.  The measurement of a tax benefit for an
uncertain tax position that meets the “more likely than not” threshold is based
on a cumulative probability model under which the largest amount of tax benefit
recognized is the amount with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority having full knowledge of all
the relevant information.  As of December 31,
2009, there were no unrecognized tax benefits. 
We do not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

Interest expense
and penalties, if any, would be recognized in the first period the interest or
penalty would begin accruing according to the provisions of the relevant tax
law at the applicable statutory rate of interest. We did not incur any tax
related interest expense or penalties for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 or 2007.

Income taxes (continued)

During the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we declared dividends on our
common stock of $1.85, $3.18 and $3.04 per share, respectively.  During the year ended December 31, 2007,
we declared dividends on our 9.10% series B cumulative redeemable preferred
stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”) of $0.4108 per share.  During the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, we declared dividends on our 8.375% series C cumulative
redeemable preferred stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”) of $2.09375 per
share.  During the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008, we declared dividends on our 7.00% series D cumulative
convertible preferred stock (“Series D Convertible Preferred Stock”) of
$1.75 and $1.409722 per share, respectively. 
See Note 11, Preferred Stock and Excess Stock.

The tax treatment
of distributions on common stock paid in 2009 was as follows: (1) 98.8%
ordinary dividend and (2) 1.2% return of capital.  Our tax return for 2009 is due on or before September 15,
2010, assuming we file for an extension of the due date.  The tax treatment of distributions on common
stock paid in 2008 was as follows: (1) 81.1% ordinary dividend; (2) 6.6%
capital gain at 15%; and (3) 12.3% return of capital.  The taxability information presented for our
dividends paid in 2009 is based upon management’s estimate.  Our tax returns for previous tax years have
not been examined by the Internal Revenue Service.  Consequently, the taxability of distributions
and dividends is subject to change.  The
information provided in this paragraph is unaudited.

Earnings per share, dividends
declared and preferred stock redemption charge

We account for
unvested restricted stock awards which contain nonforfeitable rights to
dividends as participating securities and include these securities in the
computation of earnings per share using the two-class method.  Under the two-class method, we allocate net
income after preferred stock dividends and amounts attributable to
noncontrolling interests to common stockholders and unvested restricted stock
awards based on their respective participation rights to dividends declared (or
accumulated) and undistributed earnings. 
Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average shares
of common stock outstanding determined for the basic earnings per share
computation plus the effect of any dilutive securities, including the dilutive
effect of stock options using the treasury stock method.

We applied the
if-converted method for our 8.00% unsecured senior convertible notes (“8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes”).  In
applying the if-converted method, conversion is assumed for purposes of
calculating diluted earnings per share if the effect would be dilutive to
earnings per share.  If the assumed
conversion pursuant to the if-converted method is dilutive, diluted earnings
per share would be calculated by adding back interest charges applicable to our
8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes to the numerator and our 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes would be assumed to have been converted at the beginning of
the period presented (or from the date of issuance, if occurring on a date
later than the date that the period begins) and the resulting incremental
shares associated with the assumed conversion would be included in the
denominator.  For purposes of calculating
diluted earnings per share, we did not assume conversion of our 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes since they were anti-dilutive to earnings per share for the
year ended December 31, 2009.

Earnings per share, dividends
declared and preferred stock redemption charge (continued)

The following
table shows the computation of earnings per share and dividends declared per
common share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

Our calculation of
weighted average diluted shares will include additional shares related to our
3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes when the average market price of our common
stock is higher than the conversion price ($117.36 as of December 31,
2009). The number of additional shares that will be included in the weighted
average diluted shares is equal to the number of shares that would be issued
upon the settlement of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes assuming the settlement
occurred on the end of the reporting period pursuant to the treasury stock
method.  For the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, the weighted average shares of common stock related to our
3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes have been excluded from diluted weighted
average shares of common stock as the average market price of our common stock
was lower than the conversion price of $117.36 as of December 31, 2009 related
to our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes and the impact of conversion would have been anti-dilutive.

The dilutive
effect of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will be reflected in
diluted earnings per share by application of the if-converted method.  For the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, the weighted average shares of common stock related to our Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock have been excluded from diluted weighted average
shares of common stock as the impact on diluted earnings per share was
anti-dilutive.

During 2007, we
recorded a charge of approximately $2,799,000 for costs related to the
redemption of our Series B Preferred Stock.  This amount represents the excess of the fair
value of the consideration transferred to the holders of our Series B
Preferred Stock redeemed over the carrying amount of our Series B
Preferred Stock and is subtracted from net earnings to determine net income
attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common
stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share attributable to
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders.  The cost to issue our Series B Preferred
Stock was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the period
that the preferred stock was issued. 
Upon any redemption of our preferred stock, the respective offering
costs, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration
transferred to the holders over the carrying amount of the preferred stock,
will be recognized as a dividend to preferred stockholders.  Additionally, dividends on preferred stock,
are deducted from net income to arrive at net income attributable to Alexandria
Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders.

Stock-based compensation expense

We have
historically issued two forms of stock-based compensation under our equity
incentive plan: options to purchase common stock (“options”) and restricted
stock awards.  We have not granted any
options since 2002.  We recognize all
stock-based compensation in the income statement based on the grant date fair
value.  The fair value is recorded based
on the market value of the common stock on the grant date and such cost is then
recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee
is required to provide services in exchange for the award (the vesting period).
We are required to compute stock-based compensation based on awards that are
ultimately expected to vest and as a result, future forfeitures of awards are
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  No compensation cost is recognized for equity
instruments that are forfeited or are anticipated to be forfeited.

Impact of
recently issued accounting standards

In January 2010,
the FASB issued an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) to address implementation
issues associated with the accounting for decreases in the ownership of a
subsidiary. The new guidance clarified the scope of the entities covered by the
guidance related to accounting for decreases in the ownership of a subsidiary
and specifically excluded in-substance real estate or conveyances of oil and gas
mineral rights from the scope. 
Additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures required for a
business combination achieved in stages and deconsolidation of a business or
nonprofit activity. The new guidance became effective for interim and annual periods
ending on or after December 31, 2009 and must be applied on a
retrospective basis to the first period that an entity adopted the new guidance
related to noncontrolling interests.  The
adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In January 2010,
the FASB issued an ASU to address diversity in practice related to the
accounting for a distribution to shareholders that offers them the ability to
elect to receive their entire distribution in cash or shares of equivalent
value with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that shareholders
can elect to receive in the aggregate. The new guidance clarifies that the
stock portion of a distribution to shareholders that allows them to elect to
receive cash or shares with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash
that all shareholders can elect to receive in the aggregate is considered a
share issuance that is reflected in earnings per share prospectively as opposed
to a stock dividend that is retroactively applied by restating shares
outstanding and earnings per share for all periods presented. The new guidance
became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 31,
2009 and must be applied on a retrospective basis.  The adoption of this new guidance did not
have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009,
the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the “Codification”)
as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to
be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP.  Rules and
interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under
authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for
SEC registrants.  All guidance contained
in the Codification carries an equal level of authority.  The Codification became effective for interim
or annual financial periods ending after September 15, 2009.  The adoption of the Codification did not have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009,
the FASB issued new accounting literature with respect to the consolidation of
VIEs.  The new guidance impacts the
consolidation guidance applicable to VIEs and among other things require a
qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary
beneficiary of a VIE, continuous assessments of whether a company is the
primary beneficiary of a VIE and enhanced disclosures about a company’s
involvement with a VIE.  The new guidance
applies to our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2010 and early adoption
is prohibited.  We are currently
evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial
statements.

In May 2009,
the FASB issued new accounting literature with respect to subsequent
events.  The new guidance, among other
things, clarifies accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the
balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to
be issued.  We adopted the new guidance
effective April 1, 2009 and the adoption did not have an impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

and leases associated with the properties. See Note 5, Secured Notes Payable.  The net book values of encumbered rental properties,
net as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $1,304,235,000 and
$1,324,011,000, respectively.

We lease space
under noncancellable leases with remaining terms of up to 15 years.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had
approximately $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, of rental properties,
net aggregating 11.2 million and 11.1 million rentable square feet,
respectively.  Additionally, as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, we had approximately $255.0 million and $109.5 million, respectively,
of land held for future development aggregating 4.8 million and 2.9 million
rentable square feet, respectively.  Land
held for future development represents real estate we plan to develop in the
future but as of each period presented, no construction activities were ongoing.  As a result, interest, property taxes, insurance
and other costs are expensed as incurred.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had
approximately $1.4 billion undergoing preconstruction and construction
activities, including development and redevelopment.  These projects are classified in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets as construction in progress.  As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008,
we had 575,152 and 590,057
rentable square feet, respectively, undergoing active redevelopment through a
permanent change in use to office/laboratory space, including conversion of
single tenancy to multi-tenancy spaces or multi-tenancy spaces to single
tenancy space. In addition, as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, we had 980,000 and
875,000 rentable square feet, respectively, undergoing active ground-up
development consisting of vertical above ground construction of
office/laboratory properties.  Additionally, as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, we had an aggregate of
6.3 million and 7.6 million rentable square feet, respectively, undergoing
preconstruction activities (entitlements, permitting, design and site work;
activities prior to commencement of vertical construction of above ground shell
and core) and new markets and other projects.  We are required to
capitalize interest during the period an asset is undergoing activities to
prepare it for its intended use. 
Capitalization of interest ceases after a project is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use. 
In addition, should construction activity cease, interest would be
expensed as incurred.  Total interest
capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
approximately $76,884,000, $74,194,000 and $56,057,000, respectively. Total
interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
approximately $148,370,000, $152,765,000 and $144,898,000, respectively.

Minimum lease payments
to be received under the terms of the operating lease agreements, excluding
expense reimbursements, as of December 31, 2009 are as follows (in
thousands):

4.  Investments

We hold equity
investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities
primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in
publicly traded companies are considered “available for sale” and are recorded
at fair value.  Fair value of our
investments in publicly traded companies has been determined based upon the
closing price as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses
shown as a separate component of total equity. 
The classification of each investment is determined at the time each
investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet
date.  The cost of each investment sold
is determined by the specific identification method, with net realized gains
and losses included in other income. 
Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under
the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have
virtually no influence over the entities’ operating and financial
policies.  Additionally, we limit our
ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than
10%.  As of December 31, 2009 and
2008, our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity
was less than 10%.

Individual
investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions exist that
may indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these
assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions,
available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial
results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements.  If there are no identified events or changes
in circumstances that would have an adverse effect on our cost method
investments, we do not estimate its fair value. 
For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an
investment below the carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary,
such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash
charge to current earnings.  We use “significant
other observable inputs” and “significant unobservable inputs” to determine the
fair value of privately held entities. 
As a result of these assessments, in 2008 we recognized aggregate
non-cash impairment charges of $13,251,000 for other-than-temporary declines in
the fair value of investments.

The following
table summarizes our “available for sale” securities (in thousands):

Investments in “available for sale” securities with
gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2009 had been in a continuous
unrealized loss position for less than twelve months.  We have the ability and intent to hold these
investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a recovery of our investment.  We believe that these unrealized losses are
temporary and accordingly we have not recognized an other-than-temporary
impairment related to “available for sale” securities as of December 31,
2009.

4.  Investments (continued)

Our investments in privately held entities as of December 31,
2009 and 2008 totaled approximately $64,084,000 and $55,502,000,
respectively.  Of these totals,
approximately $64,050,000 and $55,478,000, respectively, are accounted for
under the cost method.  The remainder
(approximately $34,000 and $24,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively) are accounted for under the equity method.   As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there
were no unrealized losses in our investments in privately held entities.

Net investment income of approximately $2,139,000,
$8,005,000 and $11,700,000 was recognized in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
and is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income.  Net investment income in 2009
consisted of equity in income related to investments in privately held entities
accounted for under the equity method of approximately $39,000, gross realized
gains of approximately $3,442,000 and gross realized losses of approximately
$1,342,000.  Net investment income in
2008 consisted of equity in loss related to investments in privately held
entities accounted for under the equity method of approximately $173,000, gross
realized gains of approximately $8,841,000 and gross realized losses of
approximately $663,000.  Net investment
income in 2007 consisted of equity in loss related to investments in privately
held entities accounted for under the equity method of approximately $330,000,
gross realized gains of approximately $12,216,000 and gross realized losses of
approximately $186,000.  For the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately $2,272,000,
$10,816,000 and $7,620,000, respectively, was reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income to realized gains, net and is included in other
income.

5. Secured notes
payable

Secured notes
payable totaled approximately $937.0 million and $1.1 billion as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively. Our secured notes payable had weighted average
interest rates of approximately 5.83% and 5.26% at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from March 2010 to September 2033.

Our secured notes
payable generally require monthly payments of principal and interest.  The total net book values of rental
properties, net, land held for future development and construction in progress representing
collateral for secured debt were approximately $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion as
of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  At December 31, 2009, our secured notes
payable were comprised of approximately $831.5 million and $105.5 million of
fixed and variable rate debt, respectively, compared to approximately $785.5
million and $296.4 million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively, at December 31,
2008.

Future principal payments due on secured notes payable
as of December 31, 2009 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Assumes we exercise our sole right to extend the
maturity dates of a secured note payable of approximately $28.5 million from January 1, 2011 to January 1, 2012,
and a secured note payable of approximately $38.4 million from January 2, 2012 to April 6, 2013.  Amounts include noncontrolling interests’
share of scheduled principal maturities of approximately $39.3 million, of
which approximately $17.6 million and $20.8 million mature in 2013 and 2014,
respectively.

Also, amounts are net
of unamortized discounts of approximately $2.1 million.

6.  Unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan

Our $1.9 billion
in unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion unsecured line of
credit and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to
increase commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an
additional $500 million. As of December 31, 2009, we had borrowings of
$476 million and $750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate,
including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately
4.10%.

Our unsecured line
of credit and unsecured term loan, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate
based on our election of either (1) a

London
Interbank Offered Rate

(“LIBOR”) based rate plus 1.00% to 1.45% depending on
our leverage or (2) the higher of a rate based upon Bank of America’s
prime rate plus 0.0% to 0.25% depending on our leverage and the Federal Funds
rate plus 0.50%.  For each LIBOR-based
borrowing, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months. Our
unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010 and may be extended at
our sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2011. Our
unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our
sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2012.

Our unsecured line
of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial covenants, including, among
others, the following (as defined under the terms of the agreement):

·

leverage ratio less than 65.0%;

·

fixed charge coverage ratio greater than
1.40;

·

minimum book value of $1.6 billion; and

·

secured debt ratio less than 55.0%.

In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit and unsecured
term loan restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness,
distributions, mergers, developments, land and borrowings available under our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan for developments, land and
encumbered assets.  As of December 31,
2009 and 2008, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

Aggregate
unsecured borrowings may be limited to an amount based primarily on the net
operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties and our cost
basis of development assets and land.  Aggregate unsecured borrowings may increase as
we complete the development, redevelopment or acquisition of additional
unencumbered properties.  As of December 31,
2009, aggregate unsecured borrowings were limited to approximately $2.8
billion.

7.  Unsecured convertible notes

8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes

In April 2009, we
completed a private offering of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. The net
proceeds from this offering, after initial purchasers’ fees and other offering
costs, were approximately $233.0 million. Prior to April 20, 2014, we will not
have the right to redeem the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, except to
preserve our qualification as a REIT. On and after that date, we have the right
to redeem the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time, for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the redemption date. Holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible
Notes may require us to repurchase their notes, in whole or in part, on April
15, 2014, 2019 and 2024 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the repurchase date. Holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes may
require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of
specified corporate transactions (each, a “Fundamental Change”), at a
repurchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to
be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
fundamental change repurchase date.

8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes (continued)

At issuance, the 8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of approximately
24.1546 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes, representing a conversion price of approximately
$41.40 per share of our common stock. This initial conversion price represented
a premium of 15% based on the last reported sale price of $36.00 per share of
our common stock on April 21, 2009. The conversion rate of the 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but
not limited to, certain cash dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.35
per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of
our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, there was no change from the initial
conversion rate of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. The number of shares
on which the aggregate consideration to be delivered upon conversion was
approximately 5,797,000 shares as of December 31, 2009.

Holders of the 8.00%
Unsecured Convertible Notes may convert their notes prior to the stated maturity
date of April 15, 2029 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any
calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2009, if the
closing sale price of our common stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the
immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds or is equal to 130% of the
conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
calendar quarter; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately
after any five consecutive trading day period (the “8.00% Unsecured Convertible
Note Measurement Period”) in which the average trading price per $1,000
principal amount of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes was equal to or less
than 98% of the average conversion value of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible
Notes during the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Note Measurement Period; (3) upon
the occurrence of a Fundamental Change; (4) if we call the 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes for redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including,
March 15, 2029 until the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding April 15, 2029 or earlier redemption or repurchase. Upon conversion,
holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes will receive cash, shares of
our common stock, or a combination thereof, as the case may be, at our
election.

Our 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes have been separated into their liability and equity
components as of the issuance date by recording the liability component at the
fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity
component and attributing the remaining proceeds from issuance to the equity
component. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over
its initial fair value will be amortized to interest expense using the
effective interest method over a period of five years through April 2014 (the
first date the holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes may require us
to repurchase their notes). As of the issuance date of the 8.00% Unsecured
Convertible Notes, we determined the effective interest rate of the notes to be
11.0% and approximately $26.2 million of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes
was classified as equity. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of the
equity component was approximately $26.2 million. For the year ended December
31, 2009, the amount of interest cost recognized for the period, before the
impact of capitalized interest, relating to the contractual interest coupon and
amortization of the discount on the liability component was approximately $13.0
million and $2.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the book value
of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes was approximately $215.9 million, net
of an unamortized discount of approximately $24.1 million. Based on the
December 31, 2009 closing stock price of our common stock and the December 31,
2009 conversion price of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, the
if-converted value of the notes exceeded the principal amount by approximately
$132.7 million as of December 31, 2009.

3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes

In January 2007, we
completed a private offering of $460 million principal amount of 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes. The net proceeds from this offering, after initial
purchasers’ fees and other offering costs, were approximately $450.8 million.
Prior to January 15, 2012, we will not have the right to redeem the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes, except to preserve our qualification as a REIT. On
and after that date, we have the right to redeem the 3.70% Unsecured
Convertible Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for
cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible
Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the redemption date. Holders of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes may
require us to repurchase their notes, in whole or in part, on January 15, 2012,
2017 and 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be
purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
repurchase date. Holders of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes may require
us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a
Fundamental Change, including a change in control, certain merger or
consolidation transactions or the liquidation of the Company, at a repurchase
price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be
repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
fundamental change repurchase date.

Unsecured convertible notes (continued)

3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes (continued)

At issuance, the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of approximately
8.4774 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes, representing a conversion price of approximately
$117.96 per share of our common stock. This initial conversion price
represented a premium of 20% based on the last reported sale price of $98.30
per share of our common stock on January 10, 2007. The conversion rate of the
3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes is subject to adjustments for certain events,
including, but not limited to, certain cash dividends on our common stock in
excess of $0.74 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable
in shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, the 3.70% Unsecured
Convertible Notes had a conversion rate of approximately 8.5207 shares of
common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible
Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $117.36 per
share of our common stock.

Holders of the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes may convert their notes into cash and, if
applicable, shares of our common stock prior to the stated maturity of January
15, 2027 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar
quarter after the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2007, if the closing sale
price of our common stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately
preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price in effect on
the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during
the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive
trading day period (the “3.70% Unsecured Convertible Note Measurement Period”)
in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average
conversion value of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes during the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Note Measurement Period; (3) upon the occurrence of a
Fundamental Change; (4) if we call the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes for
redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including, December 15, 2026 until the
close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15, 2027 or
earlier redemption or repurchase.

In April 2009, we
repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, certain of our 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes aggregating approximately $75 million (par value)
at an aggregate cash price of approximately $59.2 million. As a result of the
repurchases, we recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of
approximately $11.3 million, net of approximately $860,000 in unamortized issuance
costs. The gain is classified as gain on early extinguishment of debt in the
accompanying consolidated income statements. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
the carrying value of the equity component of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible
Notes was approximately $43.5 million and $43.8 million, respectively.

For the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the amount of interest cost recognized,
before the impact of capitalized interest, relating to the contractual interest
coupon of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes was approximately $15.1
million, $17.0 million and $15.3 million, respectively. Additionally, for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the amount of interest cost
recognized, before the impact of capitalized interest, relating to the
amortization of the discount on the liability component of our 3.70% Unsecured
Convertible Notes was approximately $7.9 million, $8.4 million and $7.6
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the book value of the
3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes was approximately $368.0 million and $431.1
million, respectively, net of an unamortized discount of approximately $16.7
million and $28.9 million, respectively. Our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes
require that upon conversion, the entire principal amount is to be settled in
cash, and any excess value above the principal amount, if applicable, shares of
our common stock. Based on the December 31, 2009 closing stock price of our
common stock of and the December 31, 2009 conversion price of the 3.70%
Unsecured Convertible Notes, the if-converted value of the notes did not exceed
the principal amount as of December 31, 2009, and accordingly, no shares of our
common stock would be issued if the notes were settled on December 31, 2009.

8. Interest rate hedge agreements

We are exposed to certain
risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.  We principally manage our exposures to a wide
variety of business and operational risks through management of our core
business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate,
liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and
duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate hedge agreements.  Specifically, we enter into interest rate
hedge agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that
result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of
which are determined by interest rates. 
Our interest rate hedge agreements are used to manage differences in the
amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally
related to our LIBOR-based borrowing

s

.  We do not use
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently all of our
derivatives are designated as hedges. Our objectives in using interest rate
hedge agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our
exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk
management strategy.  Interest rate swap
agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate
amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed rate
payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of
the underlying notional amount.  Interest rate cap agreements designated
as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a
counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in
exchange for an up-front premium.

The effective portion of
changes in the fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements designated and
that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income.  The amount is subsequently
reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted
transactions affect earnings.  During the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, our interest rate hedge agreements
were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with certain of our
existing LIBOR-based variable rate debt, including our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan.  The ineffective
portion of the change in fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements is
recognized directly in earnings. During the years December 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007, our interest rate hedge agreements were 100% effective, thus we did
not recognize any of the change in fair value of our interest rate hedge
agreements directly into earnings.

As of December 31,
2009 and 2008, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits based upon their
respective fair values aggregating a liability balance of approximately $49.9
million and $80.5 million, respectively, which includes accrued interest and
adjustments for non-performance risk, with the offsetting adjustment reflected
as unrealized gain (loss) in accumulated other comprehensive loss in total
equity.  Also, during the year ended December 31,
2009, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount
approximating $38.4 million effective May 15, 2009 and terminating on January 3,
2012.  This agreement sets a ceiling on
one-month LIBOR at 2.50% related to one secured note.  The interest rate cap agreement was
classified in other assets based upon its fair value aggregating an asset
balance of approximately $189,000 as of December 31, 2009.  We have not posted any collateral related to
our interest rate hedge agreements.

Balances in accumulated
other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings in the periods that the
forecasted hedge transactions affect earnings. 
For the years ended December 31 2009 and 2008 approximately $37.5
million and $14.9 million, respectively, was reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income to interest expense as an increase to interest
expense.  For the year ended December 31,
2007, approximately $3.6 million was reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to interest expense as an decrease to interest expense.
During the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify approximately $28.6 million
from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense as an
increase to interest expense.

F-25

8. Interest rate hedge agreements (continued)

As of December 31,
2009, we had the following outstanding interest rate swap agreements that were
designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (dollars in thousands):

The fair value of our
interest rate hedge agreements is determined using widely accepted valuation
techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows
of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the
derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based
inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities (also referred
to as “significant other observable inputs”). 
The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined
using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed
cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts.  The
variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates
(forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.  The
fair value of our interest rate cap agreement is determined using the market
standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that
would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the
interest rate cap agreement.  The variable interest rate used in the
calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap agreement is based
on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market
interest rate curves and volatilities. 
The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of
non-performance using “significant unobservable inputs” such as estimates of
current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have
determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate
hedge agreements. In adjusting the fair value of our interest rate hedge
agreements for the effect of non-performance risk, we have considered any
applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual
puts and guarantees.

9. Commitments and contingencies

Employee retirement savings plan

We have a retirement
savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
whereby our employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to their
respective retirement accounts in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowed
under the Internal Revenue Code.  In
addition to employee contributions, we have elected to provide discretionary
profit sharing contributions (subject to statutory limitations), which amounted
to approximately $809,000, $1,289,000 and $941,000, respectively, for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Employees who participate in the
plan are immediately vested in their contributions and in the contributions of
the Company.

9. Commitments and contingencies (continued)

Concentration of credit risk

We
maintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial institutions.  The combined account balances at each
institution periodically exceed FDIC insurance coverage, and, as a result,
there is a concentration of credit risk

related to amounts in
excess of FDIC insurance coverage.  We
have not experienced any losses to date on our invested cash.

We are
dependent on rental income from relatively few tenants in the life science
industry.  The inability of any single
tenant to make its lease payments could adversely affect our operations.  As of December 31, 2009, we held 417
leases with a total of 342 tenants and 74 of our 156 properties were each
leased to a single tenant.  At December 31,
2009, our three largest tenants accounted for approximately 17.1% of our aggregate
annualized base rent.

We generally do not
require collateral or other security from our tenants, other than security
deposits.  In addition to security
deposits held in cash, we held approximately $40.9 million in irrevocable
letters of credit available from certain tenants as security deposits for 156
leases as of December 31, 2009.

Commitments

As of December 31,
2009, remaining aggregate costs under contracts for the construction of
properties undergoing development and redevelopment and generic
office/laboratory infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases
approximated $186.8 million.  We expect
payments for these obligations to occur over the next one to three years,
subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time.  We were also committed to fund approximately
$48.3 million for certain investments over the next six years.

As of December 31,
2009, we were committed under the terms of ground leases for 19 of our
properties and three land development parcels. 
These lease obligations aggregate approximately $6.6 million in 2010,
$7.6 million in 2011, $8.2 million in 2012 and $8.6 million in 2013, $8.4
million in 2014 and $572.0 million thereafter, and have remaining lease terms
from 23 to 97 years, exclusive of extension options.  In addition, as of December 31, 2009, we
were committed under the terms of certain operating leases for our headquarters
and field offices.  These lease
obligations totaling approximately $3.3 million as of December 31, 2009
have remaining lease terms of less than one year up to three years, exclusive
of extension options.

10.  Issuances
of common stock

In September 2009,
we sold 4,600,000 shares of our common stock

in a follow-on offering (including shares issued
upon full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option)

(after deducting underwriters’ discounts and other offering costs).

In March 2009, we
sold 7,000,000 shares of our common stock

in a follow-on offering

price of $96.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately
$215 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs).

11.  Preferred
stock and excess stock

Series B
Preferred Stock

In January 2002, we
completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of our Series B Preferred

over-allotment option).   The shares were
issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of

our option, redeem our Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at
any time for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and
unpaid dividends.

Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock

In March and April 2008,
we completed a public offering of 10,000,000 shares of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock.  The shares
were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately

were used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of
credit.  The dividends on our Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original

not allowed to redeem our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, except to
preserve our status as a REIT.  Investors
in our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock generally have no voting

we may, at our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically converted if the closing sale
price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds 150% of the then-applicable
conversion price of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for at least
20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately prior to our issuance of a press release announcing the
exercise of our conversion option. 
Holders of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, at their
option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their
outstanding shares initially at a conversion rate of 0.2477 shares of common
stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was equivalent to an initial
conversion price of approximately $100.93 per share of common stock.  The conversion rate for the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events,
including, but not limited to certain dividends on our common stock in excess
of $0.78 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in
shares of our common stock.  As of December 31,
2009 the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock had a conversion rate of approximately
0.2480 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $100.81 per share of common

Preferred stock and excess stock
authorizations

Our charter
authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of
which 15,185,500 shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31,

12.  Stock plan

1997 Stock plan

In 1997, we
adopted a stock option and incentive plan for the purpose of attracting and
retaining the highest quality personnel, providing for additional incentives
and promoting the success of the Company by providing employees the opportunity
to acquire common stock pursuant to (1) options to purchase common stock
and (2) share awards.  In May 2008,
we amended and restated the 1997 stock option and incentive plan (the “Restated
1997 Stock Plan”) to increase the number of shares reserved for the grant of
awards and extend the term of the Restated 1997 Stock Plan to May 2018,
among other amendments.  As of December 31,
2009, a total of 629,896 shares were reserved for the granting of future
options and share awards under the Restated 1997 Stock Plan.

Options under our
plan have been granted at prices that are equal to the market value of the
stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. The
options outstanding under the Restated 1997 Stock Plan expire at various dates
through October 2012. We have not granted any stock options since 2002.

A summary of the
stock option activity under our Restated 1997 Stock Plan and related
information for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 follows:

F-29

12. Stock plan (continued)

1997 Stock plan

(continued)

The following
table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at
December 31, 2009:

The aggregate
intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2009 was
approximately $2.5 million.

In addition, the
Restated 1997 Stock Plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees and
non-employee directors.  A share award is
an award of common stock, that (i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may
be subject to the risk of forfeiture under Section 83 of the Internal
Revenue Code.  Shares issued generally
vest over a three-year period from the date of issuance and the sale of the
shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.  The unearned portion of these awards is
amortized as stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period.

As of December 31,
2009 and 2008 there were 455,182 and 475,421 shares, respectively, of nonvested
awards outstanding. During 2009, we granted 312,661 shares of common stock,
331,650 share awards vested and 1,250 shares were forfeited.  During 2008, we granted 230,663 shares of
common stock, 209,523 share awards vested and 3,675 shares were forfeited.  During 2007, we granted 294,376 shares of
common stock, 275,487 share awards vested and 5,282  shares were forfeited.  The weighted average grant-date fair value of
share awards g    ranted during 2009 was
approximately $53.14 per share, and the total fair value of share awards
vested, based on the market price on the vesting date, was approximately $16.4
million.  As of December 31, 2009,
there was $26.7 million of unrecognized compensation related to nonvested share
awards under the Restated 1997 Stock Plan, which is expected to be recognized
over the next three years and has a weighted average period of approximately
twelve months.  Capitalized stock
compensation was approximately $8,774,000, $7,019,000 and $8,677,000 in 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively, and is included as a reduction of general and
administrative costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

13. 
Noncontrolling interests

Noncontrolling
interests represent the third party interests in certain entities in which we
have a controlling interest and a third party interest in a variable interest
entity in which we are the primary beneficiary. 
These entities own eight properties and three development parcels and are
included in our consolidated financial statements.  Noncontrolling interests is adjusted for
additional contributions and distributions, the proportionate share of the net
earnings or losses and other comprehensive income or loss.  Distributions, profits and losses related to
these entities are allocated in accordance with the respective operating
agreements.

Certain of our
noncontrolling interests have the right to require us to redeem their ownership
interests in the respective entities.  We
classify these ownership
interests in the entities as redeemable
noncontrolling interests outside of total equity in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.  Redeemable noncontrolling interests is
adjusted for additional contributions and distributions, the proportionate
share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income or loss.
Distributions, profits and losses related to these entities are allocated in
accordance with the respective operating agreements.  If the carrying amount of redeemable
noncontrolling interests is less than the maximum redemption value at the
balance sheet date, such amount is adjusted to the maximum redemption
value.  Subsequent declines in the
redemption value are recognized only to the extent previously recorded increases
have been recorded pursuant to the preceding sentence.  As of December 31,
2009 and 2008, the redeemable
noncontrolling interest balances were approximately $41.4 million and $34.0
million, respectively.  The remaining noncontrolling interests aggregating
approximately $41.2 million and $41.1 million as of and December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively, do not have rights to require us to purchase their
ownership interests and are classified in total equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

F-30

13. 
Noncontrolling interests (continued)

As of December 31,
2009 and 2008, we were the primary beneficiary of a VIE that owns a development
parcel with a carrying value of approximately $92.3 million and $88.0 million,
respectively.  The development parcel
serves as collateral for a non-recourse secured loan that had balances of
approximately $38.4 million and $50.7 million at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively, and matures in April 2013, assuming we exercise our
sole right to extend the maturity date from the original maturity date of January 2012.  We may, in certain circumstances, be
obligated to provide additional capital to the VIE in accordance with the
operating agreement.  As of December 31,
2009 and 2008, the noncontrolling interest balance related to this entity was
approximately $23.9 million and $15.3 million, respectively, and is reflected
in redeemable noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.

14.

Non-cash
transactions

During the year ended
December 31, 2008, building improvements and equipment aggregating
$13,407,000 were transferred to the Company in a non-cash transaction.  The amount of building improvements and
equipment recognized in this transaction were determined based upon the estimated
fair value of the improvements received. 
This amount is also recognized as additional rental income amortized
over the remaining term of the applicable lease.

During the year
ended December 31, 2007, our non-cash transaction related to the acquisition
of one property located in the Eastern Massachusetts market.  We paid approximately $92.1 million for the
property which comprised of an aggregate purchase price of approximately $150.0
million less the assumption of a secured note payable of approximately $57.9
million.
