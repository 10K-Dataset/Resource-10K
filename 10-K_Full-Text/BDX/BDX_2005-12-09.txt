PART I

Item 1

. Business.

General

Becton, Dickinson and Company (also known as “BD”) was incorporated under the laws of the
State of New Jersey in November 1906, as successor to a New York business started in 1897. BD’s
executive offices are located at 1 Becton Drive, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey 07417-1880, and its telephone
number is (201) 847-6800. All references in this Form 10-K to “BD” refer to Becton, Dickinson
and Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated by the context.

BD is a medical technology company engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of a broad range
of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions,
life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public.

Business Segments

BD’s
  operations consist of three worldwide business segments: BD Medical, BD Diagnostics
  and BD Biosciences. Information with respect to BD’s business segments
  is included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in
  the portions of BD’s Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year
  ended September 30, 2005 attached hereto as Exhibit 13, and is incorporated
  herein by reference.

BD Medical

BD Medical produces a broad array of medical devices that are used in a wide range of healthcare settings.
They include many safety-engineered injection, infusion and surgery products. The primary markets
served by BD Medical are hospitals and clinics; physicians’ office practices; consumers and
retail pharmacies; public health agencies; pharmaceutical companies; and healthcare workers. BD Medical’s
principal product lines include needles, syringes and catheters for medication delivery; insulin
injection devices and blood glucose monitors for treatment of diabetes; prefillable drug delivery
devices provided to pharmaceutical companies and sold to end-users as drug/device combinations; surgical
blades and regional anesthesia needles; critical care monitoring devices; ophthalmic surgery devices;
sharps disposal containers; and home healthcare products such as ACE® brand elastic bandages.

BD Diagnostics

BD Diagnostics provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostic specimens, and
instrumentation for analysis for a broad range of microbiology and infectious disease testing. BD
Diagnostics serves hospitals, laboratories and clinics; reference laboratories; blood banks; healthcare
workers; patients; physicians’ office practices; and industrial microbiology laboratories. BD
Diagnostics’ principal products and services are integrated systems for evacuated blood collection;
an extensive line of safety-engineered specimen collection products and systems; plated media; automated
blood culturing; molecular testing systems for sexually transmitted diseases; microorganism identification
and drug susceptibility systems; and rapid manual testing products.

BD Biosciences

BD
  Biosciences produces research and clinical tools that facilitate the study of
  cells, and the components of cells, to gain a better understanding of normal
  and disease processes. That information is used to aid the discovery and development
  of new drugs and vaccines, and to improve the diagnosis and management of diseases.
  The primary markets served by BD Biosciences are research and clinical laboratories;
  hospitals and transplant centers; blood banks; and biotechnology and pharmaceutical
  companies. BD Biosciences’ principal product lines include fluorescence
  activated cell sorters and analyzers; cell imaging systems, monoclonal antibodies
  and kits; reagent systems for life sciences research; tools to aid in drug discovery
  and growth of tissue and cells; and diagnostic assays.


Discontinued Operations

On
  August 31, 2005, BD completed the sale of the Clontech unit of the BD Biosciences
  segment (“Clontech”). Clontech’s results of operations are reported
  as Discontinued Operations for all periods presented in the financial statements
  incorporated herein by reference as part of Exhibit 13.

International Operations

BD’s
  products are manufactured and sold worldwide. BD’s operations outside the
  United States are conducted in Canada and in five geographic regions: Europe
  (including the Middle East and Africa); Japan; Asia Pacific (which includes
  Australia and all of Asia except Japan); South Latin America (which includes
  Brazil); and North Latin America (which includes Mexico). The principal products
  sold by BD outside of the United States are hypodermic needles and syringes,
  insulin syringes and pen needles, diagnostic systems, BD Vacutainer™ brand
  blood collection products, BD Hypak™ brand prefillable syringe systems,
  infusion therapy products, flow cytometry analyzers and sorters, and disposable
  laboratory products. BD has manufacturing operations outside the United States
  in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Pakistan,
  Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Geographic information with
  respect to BD’s operations is included under the heading “Geographic
  Information” in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included
  in Exhibit 13, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to
foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues. BD believes
its activities in some countries outside the United States involve greater risk than its domestic
business due to the foregoing factors, as well as local commercial and economic policies and political
uncertainties.

Distribution

BD’s
  products and services are marketed in the U.S. and internationally through independent
  sales representatives and independent distribution channels, and directly to
  end-users. Sales to a single U.S. distributor that supplies products from the
  BD Medical and BD Diagnostics segments to many end-users accounted for approximately
  11% of total BD revenues in fiscal 2005. However, the end-users of BD’s
  products have access to them through other distributors, and as a result, BD
  believes that sales to this distributor would be replaced largely, if not entirely,
  by other sales if BD no longer sold products to this distributor. Order backlog
  is not material to BD’s business inasmuch as orders for BD products generally
  are received and filled on a current basis, except for items temporarily out
  of stock. BD’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal, although an
  incidence of the influenza virus can affect demand for certain medical devices
  in the BD Medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products of the
  BD Diagnostics segment in various countries.

Raw Materials

BD purchases many different types of raw materials, including plastics, glass, metals, yarn and yarn
goods, paper products, agricultural products, electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies and various
biological, chemical and petrochemical products. While all but a few of BD’s principal raw materials
are available from multiple sources, for various reasons (e.g., quality assurance and cost effectiveness),
BD elects to purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers. However, certain raw materials (primarily
related to the BD Biosciences segment) are not available from multiple sources. In other cases where
there are regulatory requirements relating to qualification of suppliers, BD may not be able to establish
additional or replacement sources on a timely basis. While BD works closely with its suppliers to
ensure continuity of supply, the termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these sole-sourced
raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.


Research and Development

BD conducts its research and development activities at its operating units and at BD Technologies in
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Substantially all of BD’s research and development activities
are conducted in the U.S. BD also collaborates with certain universities, medical centers and other
entities on research and development programs. BD also retains individual consultants to support
its efforts in specialized fields. BD spent approximately $272 million, $236 million and $224 million
on research and development during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Intellectual Property and Licenses

BD owns significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade
secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries. BD is also
licensed under domestic and foreign patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how,
copyrights and trademarks owned by others. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and
licenses are of material importance to BD’s business. BD believes, however, that no single patent,
technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to BD’s
business as a whole.

Competition

BD
  operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace
  whose dynamics are changing. Technological advances and scientific discoveries
  have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology, and regulation of
  increasingly more sophisticated and complex medical products is increasing.
  Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field. Some
  are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets, and some have
  greater financial resources than BD. New companies have entered the field, particularly
  in the areas of safety-engineered devices and in life sciences, and established
  companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology
  area. Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products
  have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well. Acquisitions
  and collaborations by and among other companies seeking a competitive advantage
  also affect the competitive environment.

BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors, including price, quality, innovation,
service, reputation, distribution and promotion. The impact of these factors on BD’s competitive
position varies among BD’s various product offerings. In order to implement one of its core
strategies—to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits
to patients, healthcare workers and researchers—and maintain an advantage in the competitive
environment in which it operates, BD continues to make investments in research and development, quality
management, quality improvement, product innovation and productivity improvement.

Third-Party Reimbursement

Healthcare providers and/or facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through numerous
payment systems designed by governmental agencies (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., NHS in
the U.K., MHLW in Japan), private insurance companies, and managed care programs. The manner and
level of reimbursement in any given case typically depends on the procedure(s) performed, the final
patient diagnosis or the device(s) and/or drug(s) utilized, or a combination of these factors, and
coverage and payment levels are determined at the payer’s discretion. The coverage policies
and reimbursement levels of third-party payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and
facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay
for those products. Thus, changes in reimbursement level or method may either positively or negatively
impact sales of BD products. While BD is actively engaged in promoting the value of its products
for payers and patients and it employs various efforts and resources to identify and address reimbursement
issues and minimize negative outcomes in this regard, it has no control over payer decision-making
with respect to coverage and adequate payment level for BD products. Additionally, many payers continue
to explore cost containment strategies that could potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels
for current or future products.

As BD’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings, they are affected to varying
degrees by the many payment systems. Therefore, BD does not believe that significant changes to any
one of these systems, while potentially impacting individual product lines or classes, would have
a material adverse effect on BD.


Regulation

BD’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by
foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development,
testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance
of BD’s medical products. The scope of the activities of these agencies, particularly in the
Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific regions in which BD operates, has been increasing.

Prior to marketing or selling most of its products, BD must secure approval from the FDA and counterpart
non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Following the introduction of a product, these agencies engage in periodic
reviews of BD’s manufacturing processes and product performance. These regulatory controls can
affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability
of new products. Where possible, BD anticipates these factors in its product development and planning
processes.

These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against BD, such
as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions. BD also undertakes voluntary
compliance actions such as voluntary recalls.

BD
  believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the regulations promulgated
  by such agencies, and that such compliance has not had, and, BD believes, should
  not have, a material adverse effect on BD. BD also believes that its operations
  comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
  Such compliance has not had, and, BD believes, should not have, a material adverse
  effect on BD. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Employees

As of September 30, 2005, BD had 25,571 employees, of whom 11,624 were employed in the United States
(including Puerto Rico). BD believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

Other Matters

Becton Dickinson France, S.A. (“BD-France”), a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”), was listed among approximately 2,200 other companies in an October 27, 2005 report of the Independent Inquiry Committee (“IIC”) of the United Nations (“UN”) as having been involved in humanitarian contracts in which unauthorized payments were suspected of having been made to the Iraqi Government in connection with the UN’s Oil-for-Food Programme.  In connection with the IIC’s report, Becton Dickinson AG, a Swiss subsidiary of BD, received a letter of inquiry from the Vendor Review Committee (“VRC”) of the United Nations Procurement Service dated November 22, 2005.  The letter of inquiry said that VRC is reviewing Becton Dickinson AG’s registration status in light of BD-France
being listed in the IIC’s report and asked us for any information we might provide relating to the findings of the report.  We have responded to the VRC’s letter of inquiry and are cooperating fully with the UN in connection with this matter.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995—“SAFE HARBOR”
FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The
  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides
  a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of BD. BD
  and its representatives may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements
  in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements
  contained in this report and filings with the SEC and in our other reports to
  shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words
  like “plan,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,”
  “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and other words
  of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future
  operations and financial performance, as well as our strategy for growth, product
  development, regulatory approvals, market position and expenditures. All statements
  that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect
  or anticipate will occur in the future—including statements relating to
  volume growth, sales and earnings per share growth and statements expressing
  views about future operating results—are forward-looking statements within
  the meaning of the Act.

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The forward-looking
statements are and will be based on management’s then-current views and assumptions regarding
future events and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize
that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual
results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned
not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking


statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements
whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise.

The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations
in any forward-looking statements:


Ÿ

The impact of
      business combinations, including acquisitions and divestitures, both internally
      for BD and externally in the healthcare industry.

Ÿ

Issuance
      of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards
      Board or the SEC.

The foregoing
  list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability
  to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should
  understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and
  should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks
  and uncertainties.

Item 2.

Properties

.

BD’s
  executive offices are located in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. As of November
  30, 2005, BD owned and leased approximately 13,835,000 square feet of manufacturing,
  warehousing, administrative and research facilities throughout the world. The
  U.S. facilities, including Puerto Rico, comprise approximately 5,895,000 square
  feet of owned and 1,987,000 square feet of leased space. The international facilities
  comprise approximately 3,723,000 square feet of owned and 2,230,000 square feet
  of leased space. Sales offices and distribution centers included in the total
  square footage are also located throughout the world.

Operations in each of BD’s business segments are conducted at both U.S. and international locations.
Particularly in the international marketplace, facilities often serve more than one business segment
and are used for multiple purposes, such as administrative/sales, manufacturing and/or warehousing/distribution.
BD generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities, although some are leased. Most of BD’s
administrative, sales and warehousing/distribution facilities are leased.

BD believes that its facilities are of good construction and in good physical condition, are suitable
and adequate for the operations conducted at those facilities, and are, with minor exceptions, fully
utilized and operating at normal capacity.

The
  U.S. facilities include facilities in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
  Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska,
  New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
  Washington, DC, Wisconsin and Puerto Rico.

The international facilities are grouped as follows:


—Asia
      Pacific includes facilities in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,
      Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, South
      Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, and is comprised of approximately 1,104,000
      square feet of owned and 320,000 square feet of leased space.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

In 1986, BD acquired a business that manufactured, among other things, latex surgical gloves. In 1995,
BD divested this glove business. BD, along with a number of other manufacturers, has been named as
a defendant in approximately 524 product liability lawsuits related to natural rubber latex that
have been filed in various state and Federal courts. Cases pending in Federal court are being coordinated
under the matter

In re Latex Gloves Products Liability Litigation

(MDL Docket No. 1148) in Philadelphia, and analogous procedures have been implemented in the state
courts of California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Generally, these actions allege that
medical personnel have suffered allergic reactions ranging from skin irritation to anaphylaxis as
a result of exposure to medical gloves containing natural rubber latex. Since the inception of this
litigation, 463 of these cases have been closed with no liability to BD (462 of which were closed
with prejudice), and 45 cases have been settled for an aggregate de minimis amount.

BD, along with another manufacturer and several medical product distributors, is named as a defendant
in three product liability lawsuits relating to healthcare workers who allegedly sustained accidental
needlesticks, but have not become infected with any disease. Generally, these actions allege that
healthcare workers have sustained needlesticks using hollow-bore needle devices manufactured by BD
and, as a result, require medical testing, counseling and/or treatment. In some cases, these actions
additionally allege that the healthcare workers have sustained mental anguish. Plaintiffs seek money
damages in all of these actions. BD had previously been named as a defendant in eight similar suits
relating to healthcare workers who allegedly sustained accidental needlesticks, each of which has
either been dismissed with prejudice or voluntarily withdrawn. Regarding the three pending suits:


BD continues to oppose class action certification in these cases, including pursuing all appropriate
rights of appeal.

In Illinois, the matter of

McCaster vs. Becton Dickinson

(Case No. 04L 012544) was settled on July 5, 2005 for an amount that is not material to BD’s
results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. This case was originally filed as a purported
class action needlestick case in the Circuit Court of Cook County and had been refiled in November
2004 as an individual personal injury case.

A
  purported class action suit was brought against BD under the caption

Danielle
  Cardozo, by her litigation guardian Darlene Cardozo v. Becton, Dickinson and
  Company

(Civil Action No. S83059, Supreme Court, British Columbia) on November
  6, 2003. The suit alleged personal injury to persons in British Columbia who
  received test results generated by the

BD ProbeTec

ET instrument, and
  sought money damages. BD has reached a settlement in this case for an amount
  that is not material to BD’s results of operations, financial condition
  or cash flows.

BD has insurance policies in place, and believes that a substantial portion of potential liability,
if any, in the latex and class action matters would be covered by insurance. In order to protect
our rights to additional coverage, BD filed an action for declaratory judgment under the caption

Becton Dickinson and Company vs. Adriatic Insurance Company et al.

(Docket No. MID-L-3649-99MT, Middlesex County Superior Court) in New Jersey state court. BD has withdrawn
this action, with the right to refile, so that settlement discussions with the insurance companies
may proceed.

On August 3, 2004, BD was served with an administrative subpoena issued by the United States Attorney’s
Office in Dallas, Texas (the “U.S. Attorney”) in connection with an investigation the U.S.
Attorney is conducting of transactions between another company and certain of its suppliers, including
BD. BD has fully responded to the subpoena. BD believes that its transactions with the other company
have fully complied with the law and that BD is not currently a target of the investigation.

On August 8, 2005, BD received a subpoena issued by the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut,
which seeks documents and information relating to BD’s participation as a member of Healthcare
Research & Development Institute, LLC. (“HRDI”), a healthcare trade organization (an
independent member of BD’s board of directors, Gary Mecklenburg, also serves as the non-executive
chairman of HRDI). The subpoena indicates that it was issued as part of an investigation into possible
violations of the antitrust laws. BD believes that its participation in HRDI complies fully with
the law and has no additional information regarding the investigation at this time. BD is responding
to the subpoena.

BD is named as a defendant in five purported class action suits brought on behalf of direct purchasers
of BD’s products, such as distributors, alleging that BD violated federal antitrust laws, resulting
in the charging of higher prices for BD’s products to the plaintiff and other purported class
members. The cases filed are as follows:

Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Inc., et. al. vs. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Civil Action No. 05-1602, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey) filed on March 25, 2005;

SAJ Distributors, Inc. et. al. vs. Becton Dickinson & Co.

(Case 2:05-CV-04763-JD, United States District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania), filed on September
6, 2005;

Dik Drug Company, et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson and Company

(Case No. 2:05-CV-04465, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey) filed on September 12, 2005;

American Sales Company, Inc. et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson & Co.

(Case No. 2:05-CV-05212-CRM, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania), filed on October
3, 2005; and

Park Surgical Co. Inc. et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson and Company

(Case 2:05-cv-05678-CMR,


United States District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania), filed on October 26, 2005. The actions
brought by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company and Dik Drug Company in New Jersey have been consolidated
under the caption “In re Hypodermic Products Antitrust Litigation.” On June 7, 2005,
Jabo’s Pharmacy, Inc. filed a purported class action lawsuit against BD under the caption

Jabo’s Pharmacy, Inc., et. al. v. Becton Dickinson & Company

(Case No. 2:05-CV-00162, United States District Court, Greenville, Tennessee) seeking monetary damages.
The complaint alleges that BD violated federal and various state antitrust laws, resulting in the
charging of higher prices for BD’s products to plaintiff and other purported class members.
Unlike the complaints described above, which were brought on behalf of direct purchasers of BD’s
products, the Jabo’s Pharmacy complaint is brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of BD’s
products. The plaintiffs in each of these cases seek monetary damages. BD has made a motion before
the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer all of the above actions for coordinated
or consolidated pre-trial proceedings. The panel heard BD's motion on November 17, 2005, but has not yet issued a decision.

On August 31, 2005, Daniels Sharpsmart filed suit against BD, another manufacturer and three group
purchasing organizations under the caption

Daniels Sharpsmart, Inc. v. Tyco International, (US) Inc., et. al.

(Civil Action No. 505CV169, United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas). The plaintiff
alleges, among other things, that BD and the other defendants conspired to exclude the plaintiff
from the sharps-collection market by entering into long-term contracts in violation of federal and
state antitrust laws, and seeks monetary damages.

BD was a defendant in the matter of

Dynovation Medical, Inc. et al v. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Civil Action No. 505CV73, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas). The plaintiffs in the
suit had alleged, among other things, that BD materially breached its license agreement with Dynovation
relating to BD’s

Insyte Autoguard

IV catheter product, and that BD’s safety blood collection sets infringed certain Dynovation patents.
This suit was concluded in September 2005 resulting in BD receiving a fully-paid up patent license
from Dynovation.

On May 28, 2004, Therasense, Inc. (“Therasense”) filed suit against BD in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California (Case Number: C 04-02123 WDB) asserting that BD’s
blood glucose monitoring products infringe certain Therasense patents. On August 10, 2004, in response
to a motion filed by Therasense in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the
court transferred to the court in California an action previously filed by BD against Therasense
requesting a declaratory judgment that BD’s products do not infringe the Therasense patents
and that the Therasense patents are invalid.

BD believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the above-mentioned suits pending against BD
and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters.

BD
  is also involved both as a plaintiff and as a defendant in other legal proceedings
  and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.

BD
  is a party to a number of federal proceedings in the United States brought under
  the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also
  known as “Superfund,” and similar state laws. For all sites, there
  are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable
  to pay all cleanup costs.

Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, BD is not able in all cases to estimate the amount
or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which BD is a
party. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, BD establishes accruals
to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without
considering possible third-party recoveries). In view of the uncertainties discussed above, BD could
incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess
liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the
aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations and
consolidated cash flows in the period or periods in which they are recorded or paid.

  of the design and operation of BD’s disclosure controls and procedures
  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as
  of September 30, 2005. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
  and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these
  disclosure controls and procedures were, as of the end of the period covered
  by this report, effective and designed to ensure that material information relating
  to BD and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others
  within these entities. There were no changes in BD's internal control over financial
  reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005 identified in connection
  with the above-referenced evaluations that has materially affected, or is reasonably
  likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.

Accounting Firm on pages 33 and 35, respectively, of Exhibit 13 are incorporated herein by reference.

Item 14.

Principal Accounting Fees and Services.

The information required by this item will be contained under the caption “Proposal 2. Ratification
of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in BD’s Proxy Statement, and such information
is incorporated herein by reference.

BD’s
  independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP (“E&Y”),
  has notified the Audit Committee of the BD Board of Directors that E&Y performed
  certain non-audit services for BD in New Zealand that were inconsistent with
  standards for auditor independence under applicable auditor rules. Specifically,
  E&Y disclosed to the Audit Committee that, between 1996 and 2005, an affiliate
  of E&Y had acted as the company secretary and registered office for a local
  BD subsidiary. Fees were paid to the E&Y affiliate for tax compliance services,
  but no separate amounts were identified as applying to the corporate secretarial
  and registered office services. The Audit Committee has had discussions with
  E&Y regarding E&Y’s independence in light of these activities.
  E&Y advised the Audit Committee of its conclusion that E&Y’s independence
  is not impaired as to BD as a result of these activities, based upon, among
  other things, the ministerial nature of the services performed and the fact
  that no fees were specifically paid for these services. Although E&Y’s
  review of its non-audit services is ongoing, BD is not aware of the performance
  by E&Y of any other non-audit services performed by E&Y that were inconsistent
  with standards for auditor independence under applicable auditor rules, other
  than as previously disclosed. In November 2005, E&Y issued its letter to
  BD pursuant to Rule 3600T of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”),
  in which it reported that it is independent under applicable SEC and PCAOB standards.
