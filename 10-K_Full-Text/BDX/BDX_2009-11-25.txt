PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

Becton, Dickinson and Company (also known as “BD”) was incorporated under the laws of the
State of New Jersey in November 1906, as successor to a New York business started in 1897. BD’s
executive offices are located at 1 Becton Drive, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey 07417-1880, and its
telephone number is (201) 847-6800. All references in this Form 10-K to “BD” refer to Becton,
Dickinson and Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated by the
context.

BD is a global medical technology company engaged principally in the development, manufacture
and sale of medical devices, instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions, life
science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public.

Business Segments

BD’s operations consist of three worldwide business segments: BD Medical, BD Diagnostics and
BD Biosciences. Information with respect to BD’s business segments is included in Note 17 to the
consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,
and is incorporated herein by reference.

BD Medical

BD Medical produces a broad array of medical devices that are used in a wide range of
healthcare settings. They include many safety-engineered injection, infusion and surgery products.
BD Medical’s principal product lines include needles, syringes and intravenous catheters for
medication delivery; prefilled IV flush syringes; syringes and pen needles for the self-injection
of insulin and other drugs used in the treatment of diabetes; prefillable drug delivery devices
provided to pharmaceutical companies and sold to end-users as drug/device combinations; surgical
blades/scalpels and regional anesthesia needles and trays; critical care monitoring devices;
ophthalmic surgical instruments; and sharps disposal containers. The primary customers served by BD
Medical are hospitals and clinics; physicians’ office practices; consumers and retail pharmacies;
governmental and nonprofit public health agencies; pharmaceutical companies; and healthcare
workers.

BD Diagnostics

BD Diagnostics provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostics
specimens, as well as instrument systems and reagents to detect a broad range of infectious
diseases, healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and cancers. BD Diagnostics’ principal products
include integrated systems for specimen collection; safety-engineered blood collection products and
systems; automated blood culturing systems; molecular testing systems for sexually transmitted
diseases and HAIs; microorganism identification and drug susceptibility systems; liquid-based
cytology systems for cervical cancer screening; rapid diagnostic assays; and plated media. BD
Diagnostics serves hospitals, laboratories and clinics; reference laboratories; blood banks;
healthcare workers; public health agencies; physicians’ office practices; and industrial and food
microbiology laboratories.

BD Biosciences

BD Biosciences produces research and clinical tools that facilitate the study of cells, and
the components of cells, to gain a better understanding of normal and disease processes. That
information is used to aid the discovery and development of new drugs and vaccines, and to improve
the diagnosis and management of diseases. BD Biosciences’ principal product lines include
fluorescence-activated cell sorters and analyzers; monoclonal antibodies and kits for performing
cell analysis; reagent systems for life sciences research; cell imaging systems; laboratory
products for tissue culture and fluid handling; diagnostic assays; and cell culture media supplements for
biopharmaceutical manufacturing. The primary customers served by BD Biosciences are research and
clinical laboratories; academic and government institutions; pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies; hospitals; and blood banks.

Acquisitions

On November 19, 2009, BD acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of HandyLab, Inc.
(“HandyLab”), a company that develops and manufactures molecular diagnostic assays and automation
platforms. The purchase price was $275 million in cash. HandyLab has developed and
commercialized a flexible automated platform for performing molecular
diagnostics that complements
BD’s molecular diagnostics offerings, specifically in the area of healthcare-associated infections.



International Operations

BD’s
products are manufactured and sold worldwide. For reporting purposes,
we organize our  operations
outside the U.S. as follows: Europe (which includes the Middle East
and Africa); Japan; Asia Pacific (which includes Australia and all of
Asia except Japan); Latin
America (which includes Mexico and Brazil) and Canada. The principal products sold by BD outside of the U.S.
are needles and syringes; insulin syringes and pen needles; diagnostic systems; BD
Vacutainer

TM

brand blood collection products; BD Hypak

TM

brand prefillable
syringe systems; infusion therapy products; flow cytometry instruments and reagents; and disposable
laboratory products. BD has manufacturing operations  in Brazil, Canada, China,
France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and
the United Kingdom. Geographic information with respect to BD’s operations is included under the
heading “Geographic Information” in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability
related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues.
BD believes its activities in some countries outside the U.S. involve greater risk than its
domestic business due to the factors cited herein, as well as the economic environment, local
commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties. See further discussion of this risk
in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Distribution

BD’s products are marketed in the U.S. and internationally through independent distribution
channels and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. No customer
accounted for 10% or more of revenues in fiscal year 2009. Order backlog is not material to BD’s
business inasmuch as orders for BD products generally are received and filled on a current basis,
except for items temporarily out of stock. BD’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal, with
the exception of certain medical devices in the BD Medical segment, and respiratory and flu
diagnostic products in the BD Diagnostics segment, that relate to seasonal diseases such as
influenza.

Raw Materials

BD purchases many different types of raw materials, including plastics, glass, metals,
textiles, paper products, agricultural products, electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies and
various biological, chemical and petrochemical products. Certain raw materials (primarily related
to the BD Biosciences segment) are not available from multiple sources. In the case of certain
principal raw materials that are available from multiple sources, for various reasons (including
quality assurance and cost effectiveness), BD elects to purchase these raw materials from sole
suppliers. In cases where there are regulatory requirements relating to qualification of suppliers,
BD may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis. While BD works
closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, the termination, reduction or
interruption in supply of these sole-sourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture
and sell certain of our products.

Research and Development

BD conducts its research and development activities at its operating units and at BD
Technologies in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Substantially all of BD’s research and
development activities are conducted in the U.S. BD also collaborates with certain universities,
medical centers and other entities on research and development programs, and retains individual
consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields. BD spent approximately $408 million, $396
million and $359 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended September 30,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, BD incurred acquired in-process research and
development charges of $122 million related to the acquisitions of TriPath Imaging, Inc. and Plasso
Technology, Ltd. in fiscal year 2007.

Intellectual Property and Licenses

BD owns significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology,
trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. BD is also
licensed under domestic and foreign patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets,
know-how, copyrights and trademarks owned by others. In the aggregate, these intellectual property
assets and licenses are of material importance to BD’s business. BD believes, however, that no
single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in
relation to BD’s business as a whole, or to any business segment.

Competition

BD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace whose
dynamics are changing. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace
of change in medical technology, and regulation of increasingly more sophisticated and complex
medical products is increasing. Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology
field. Some are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets, and some have greater
financial resources than BD. New companies have entered the field, particularly in the areas of
molecular diagnostics, safety-engineered devices and in the  life sciences, and established
companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area. Other firms
engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical
devices and



instruments as well. Acquisitions and collaborations by and among other companies seeking a
competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment. In addition, the entry into the
market of manufacturers located in China and other low-cost manufacturing locations are creating
increased pricing pressures, particularly in developing markets. Some competitors have also
established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a
means to lower their costs. New entrants may also appear, particularly from these low-cost
countries.

BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors, including price,
quality, innovation, service, reputation, distribution and promotion. The impact of these factors
on BD’s competitive position varies among BD’s various product offerings. In order to implement one
of its core strategies – to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater
benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers – and maintain an advantage in the
competitive environment in which it operates, BD continues to make investments in research and
development, quality management, quality improvement, product innovation and productivity
improvement.

Third-Party Reimbursement

Healthcare providers and/or facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through
numerous payment systems maintained by governmental agencies (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the
U.S., the National Health Service in the U.K., the Joint Federal Committee in Germany, the
Commission d’Evaluation des Produits et prestations in France, and the Ministry for Health, Labor
and Welfare in Japan), private insurance companies, and managed care organizations. The manner and
level of reimbursement in any given case typically depends on the site of care, the procedure(s)
performed, the final patient diagnosis, the device(s) and/or drug(s) utilized, the available
budget, or a combination of these factors, and coverage and payment levels are determined at the
payer’s discretion. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers may impact
the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase
and the prices they are willing to pay for those products. Thus, changes in reimbursement level or
method may either positively or negatively impact sales of BD products. While BD is actively
engaged in promoting the value of its products for payers and patients, and it employs various
efforts and resources to positively impact coverage, coding and payment processes in this regard,
it has no direct control over payer decision-making with respect to coverage and the payment level
for BD products. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to explore cost-containment
strategies (e.g., comparative effectiveness analyses, so-called “pay-for-performance” programs
implemented by various public and private payers, and expansion of payment bundling schemes) that
could potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for current or future BD products.

As BD’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings, they are affected to
varying degrees by the many payment systems. Therefore, individual countries, product lines or
product classes may be impacted by changes to these systems. Notably, healthcare reform that is currently under consideration
in the U.S. Congress could substantially change the health insurance system in this country. As
yet, it is unclear whether, or how, this might affect payment for BD products.

Regulation

BD’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign
governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development,
testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance
of BD’s medical products. The scope of the activities of these agencies, particularly in the
Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific regions in which BD operates, has been increasing.

Prior to marketing or selling most of its products, BD must secure approval from the FDA and
counterpart non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Following the introduction of a product, these agencies
engage in periodic reviews of BD’s manufacturing processes, product performance, and advertising
and promotional materials. These regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with
the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. Where possible, BD
anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes.

These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against
BD, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions. BD also
undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls. On May 11, 2009, BD received a
warning letter from the FDA citing concerns that a communication posted on BD’s website contained
some language that the FDA believed could be interpreted as promoting the use of the BD

ä

EZ
Flu A+B test to diagnose patients that were suspected of having the 2009 variant of the H1N1 flu
virus. In response, BD immediately removed the information from its website and implemented a
series of comprehensive corrective and preventive actions around promotional activities. BD
subsequently held a follow-up meeting with the FDA in July 2009, during which the FDA indicated it
was satisfied with BD’s response to date.

BD
believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable
law and the regulations promulgated by
such agencies (including a without limitation, environmental laws and
regulations), and that such compliance has not had, and will not
have, a material adverse effect on our operations or results.
See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.



Employees

As of September 30, 2009, BD had 29,116 employees, of whom 12,698 were employed in the U.S.
(including Puerto Rico). BD believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

Other Matters

Becton Dickinson France, S.A. (“BD-France”), a subsidiary of BD, was listed among
approximately 2,200 other companies in an October 27, 2005 report of the Independent Inquiry
Committee (“IIC”) of the United Nations (“UN”) as having been involved in humanitarian contracts in
which unauthorized payments were suspected of having been made to the Iraqi Government in
connection with the UN’s Oil-for-Food Programme (the “Programme”). In connection with the IIC’s
report, Becton Dickinson AG, a Swiss subsidiary of BD, received a letter of inquiry from the Vendor
Review Committee (“VRC”) of the United Nations Procurement Service dated November 22, 2005. The
letter of inquiry said that the VRC is reviewing Becton Dickinson AG’s registration status in light
of BD-France being listed in the IIC’s report and asked us for any information we might be able to
provide relating to the findings of the report. BD conducted an internal review and found no
evidence that BD or any BD employee made, authorized, or approved improper payments to the Iraqi
Government in connection with the Programme. The representative utilized by BD in Iraq also
unequivocally denied having made any such payments, and BD was unable to find any evidence of such
payments being made by this representative. BD has also reported the results of its internal review
to the VRC. In May 2008, BD received a letter from the U.N. stating that Becton Dickinson AG had
been suspended from the U.N. Secretariat Procurement Division’s vendor roster for a minimum period
of six months. We have requested that Becton Dickinson AG be reinstated. BD believes that the
suspension has not had and will not have a material adverse effect on BD.

In May 2007, the French Judicial Police conducted searches of BD-France’s offices in France
with respect to the matters that were the subject of the 2005 IIC report. We were informed that
BD-France is one of a number of companies named in the IIC report that is being investigated by the
French Judicial Police. In June 2009, the Belgian Federal Police contacted BD to interview certain
individuals and review documents related to sales made under the Programme. We are cooperating
fully with these investigations.

Forward-Looking Statements

BD and its representatives may from time-to-time make certain forward-looking statements in
publicly-released materials, both written and oral, including
statements contained in  filings with
 the SEC and in our  reports to shareholders. Additional information regarding
our forward-looking statements is contained Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following describes
some of the significant risks that could adversely affect BD’s business, financial condition,
operating results or cash flows.

Current economic conditions could adversely affect our operations.

The global financial crisis has caused extreme disruption in the financial markets, including
severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. While these conditions have not impaired
our ability to access credit markets to date, there can be no assurance that these conditions will
not adversely affect our ability to do so in the future, particularly if there is further
deterioration in the world financial markets and major economies. The current economic conditions
may also adversely affect the business of our customers and the amount spent on healthcare
generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, longer
sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. During 2009,
the global recession weakened the demand for our products in certain areas of our business, in
particular, that of our Biosciences segment in the U.S., which was affected by a slowdown in
research-related capital spending. The strength and timing of any economic recovery remains
uncertain, and there can be no assurance that the economic downturn will not continue to affect our
operations in the future.

In addition, the current economic conditions may adversely affect our suppliers, such as resin
suppliers that do substantial business with the automotive industry, which could cause disruptions
in our ability to produce our products. For example, during fiscal year 2009, Lyondell Chemical
Company and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Lyondell”) filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Lyondell supplies BD with medical grade resins used to
manufacture products in our BD Medical and BD Diagnostics segments. In addition, Smurfit-Stone Container
Corp., a supplier of packaging materials, also filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.
While BD has not experienced any interruption in the supply from any of its suppliers to date,
there can be no assurances that BD will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future.



We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.

Over half of our fiscal year 2009 revenues were derived from international operations. Our
revenues outside the U.S. may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. During fiscal year 2009, worldwide currencies experienced extreme volatility, which
negatively impacted our reported results. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate
fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to address any impact is contained in
Item. 7, Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our hedging
activities may, however, only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from
unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty
changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks.

Proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system may have a material adverse effect on us.

The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system in an effort
to contain healthcare costs and increase access. Although a number of proposals have received
varying levels of support in Congress, there still is no consensus on a number of key issues,
including coverage mandates and the establishment of a public healthcare insurance option. Several
proposals on how to finance healthcare reform are also being considered. Certain proposals would
impose an excise tax on medical device companies such as BD, which could go into effect as early as
calendar year 2010. While we cannot predict what healthcare legislation, if any, will be passed
into law, such legislation could, among other things, lower reimbursements for our products, reduce
the volume of medical procedures or impose additional financial burdens on BD.

Changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect the demand for our products
and the prices at which they are sold.

Our sales depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are
reimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for the costs
of our products. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers may affect
which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products.
Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the U.S., as part of the
healthcare reform being debated, or abroad could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures
using BD medical devices, or result in denial of reimbursement for those products. See
“Third-Party Reimbursement” under Item 1. Business.

Price volatility could adversely affect the results of our operations.

Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price volatility in the cost of raw
materials, components, freight and energy. In particular, BD purchases supplies of resins, which
are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products. Any significant increases in
resin purchase costs could impact future operating results. Increases in the price of oil can also
increase BD’s costs for packaging and transportation. These cost increases may adversely affect
our profitability.

BD’s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurance
that such products will be developed.

A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products
that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers. The development of
these products requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory
approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors,
including BD’s ability to innovate, develop and manufacture new products, complete clinical trials,
obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad, or gain and maintain
market approval of our products. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our
commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or
that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory
approval, or gain market acceptance.

The medical technology industry is very competitive.

The medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes, and we face
significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold.
We face this competition from a wide range of companies. These include large medical device
companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We also
face competition from firms that are more specialized than us with
respect to particular markets. Other firms engaged in the
distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers
of medical devices and instruments as well.
In some instances, competitors,
including pharmaceutical companies, also offer, or are attempting to develop, alternative therapies
for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. The development of new or
improved products, processes or technologies by other companies (such as needle-free injection
technology) may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In
addition, the entry into the market of manufacturers located in China and other low-cost
manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures, particularly in developing
markets. Some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with
suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs. New entrants may also
appear, particularly from these low-cost countries.



A reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely
affect BD’s manufacturing operations and related product sales.

BD purchases many different types of raw materials and components. We have generally been
able to obtain adequate supplies of these materials. However, certain raw materials (primarily
related to the BD Biosciences segment) and components are not available from multiple sources. In
addition, for quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and other reasons, BD elects to purchase
certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers. The supply of these materials can be
disrupted for a number of reasons, including  current economic conditions as described above.
While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, no assurance can be given that these
efforts will be successful. In addition, where there are regulatory requirements relating to the
qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a
timely basis. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these sole-sourced raw
materials and components could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.

Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect BD’s future revenues and
operating income.

We have manufacturing sites all over the world. In addition, in some instances, the
manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. As a
result, weather, natural disasters (including pandemic disease), terrorism, political change, or
damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our
products.

BD is subject to a number of pending lawsuits.

BD is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits
for alleged antitrust violations and product liability, and could be subject to additional lawsuits
in the future. A more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in Item 3. Legal
Proceedings. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to
estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the
litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in
excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability
insurance. Any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect BD’s
results of operations and cash flows.

Consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect BD’s future revenues and operating
income.

The medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation. As a
result of this consolidation, competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased.
In addition, group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to
concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has placed pricing pressure on medical
device suppliers. Further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the
prices of our products.

Product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations.

The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks.
Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of
risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events
could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or required by
the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain
cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs, as
well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.
Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims
being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new
product approvals.

We may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system.

We have initiated a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. Our
ERP system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record
transactions, provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements.
The design and implementation of the new ERP system has required, and will continue to require,
the investment of significant financial and human resources. The total cost needed to implement
the new ERP system may turn out to be more than we currently anticipate. In addition, we may not
be able to successfully implement the new ERP system without experiencing difficulties. Any
disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP system could
adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer
support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our
business.

BD is subject to extensive regulation.

BD is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and
governing bodies. Most of BD’s products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or
counterpart non-U.S. regulatory agencies before they can be marketed or sold. The process for
obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the
expenditure of substantial resources. The process may also require changes to our products or
result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products. In addition, regulatory requirements
outside the U.S. change frequently, requiring prompt action to maintain compliance, particularly
when product modifications are required.

Following the introduction of a product, these agencies also periodically review our
manufacturing processes and product performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable good
manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, clinical trial and other



requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production, marketing or sale of our
products and result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, closure of
manufacturing sites, seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation.

We cannot guarantee that any of BD’s strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be
successful.

While our strategy to increase revenue growth is driven primarily by internal product
development, we seek to supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and
alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky. The success of any acquisition, investment or
alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value
the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate it into our existing business.
There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful.

The international operations of BD’s business may subject BD to certain business risks.

BD operations outside the U.S. subject BD to certain risks, including the effects of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange (as discussed above), the spread of a global economic
downturn, changes in foreign regulatory requirements, potential political instability, trade
barriers, weakening of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, and
restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders. The success of our operations outside the
U.S. will depend, in part, on our ability to acquire or form alliances with local companies and
make necessary infrastructure enhancements to, among other things, our production facilities and
distribution networks.

Reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our BD
Biosciences segment.

Our BD Biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies, academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations. Research and
development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and, as was
experienced in fiscal year 2009, general economic conditions. A number of these customers are also
dependent for their funding upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. National
Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and agencies in other countries. The level of government funding of
research and development is unpredictable. There have been instances where NIH grants have been
frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods. The availability of governmental research
funding may also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic downturn. Any reduction
or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our
products.

Our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property rights.

Many of BD’s businesses rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights.
While we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset would
materially adversely affect BD operations, these intellectual property assets, in the aggregate,
are of material importance to our business. BD can lose the protection afforded by these
intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action.
Patents attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products expire, may also adversely
affect our competitive position. The loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual
property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition or cash flows.

Natural disasters, war and other events could adversely affect BD’s future revenues and operating
income.

Natural
disasters (including pandemics), war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts,
and actions taken by the United States and other governments in response to such events, could
cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the U.S. and in areas
outside of the U.S. in which we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for our
products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, or increase the costs
for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers. Recently, the World
Health Organization issued its highest pandemic alert relating to the H1N1 flu. Depending on its
severity, such a pandemic could adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities,
or increase the costs for, or cause interruptions in, the supply of materials from our suppliers.

We need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.

Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives
and other key employees, including people in technical, marketing, sales and research positions.
Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with specialized skills, can be
intense. The Company’s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors, including
compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. If we cannot effectively recruit and
retain qualified executives and employees, our business could be adversely affected.

Properties

.

BD’s executive offices are located in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. As of November 1, 2009, BD
owned and leased approximately 16,396,798 square feet of manufacturing, warehousing, administrative
and research facilities throughout the world. The



U.S. facilities, including Puerto Rico, comprise approximately 6,928,206 square feet of owned
and 1,767,167 square feet of leased space. The international facilities comprise approximately
6,350,866 square feet of owned and 1,350,559 square feet of leased space. Sales offices and
distribution centers included in the total square footage are also located throughout the world.

Operations in each of BD’s business segments are conducted at both U.S. and international
locations. Particularly in the international marketplace, facilities often serve more than one
business segment and are used for multiple purposes, such as administrative/sales, manufacturing
and/or warehousing/distribution. BD generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities, although
some are leased.

BD believes that its facilities are of good construction and in good physical condition, are
suitable and adequate for the operations conducted at those facilities, and are, with minor
exceptions, fully utilized and operating at normal capacity.

The U.S. facilities include facilities in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, DC, Washington, Wisconsin and
Puerto Rico.

The international facilities are grouped as follows:

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

BD is named as a defendant in five purported class action suits brought on behalf of direct
purchasers of BD’s products, such as distributors, alleging that BD violated federal antitrust
laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for BD’s products to the plaintiff and other
purported class members. The cases filed are as follows:

Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Inc.,
et. al. vs. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Civil Action No. 05-1602, U.S. District Court, Newark,
New Jersey), filed on March 25, 2005;

SAJ Distributors, Inc. et. al. vs. Becton Dickinson & Co.

(Case 2:05-CV-04763-JD, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania), filed on September
6, 2005;

Dik Drug Company, et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson and Company

(Case No. 2:05-CV-04465, U.S.
District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on September 12, 2005;

American Sales Company, Inc. et.
al. vs. Becton, Dickinson & Co.

(Case No. 2:05-CV-05212-CRM, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of Pennsylvania), filed on October 3, 2005; and

Park Surgical Co. Inc.



et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson and Company

(Case 2:05-CV-05678- CMR, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania), filed on October 26, 2005. These actions have been consolidated under
the caption

“In re Hypodermic Products Antitrust Litigation.”

BD is also named as a defendant in four purported class action suits brought on behalf of
indirect purchasers of BD’s products, alleging that BD violated federal and state antitrust laws,
resulting in the charging of higher prices for BD’s products to the plaintiff and other purported
class members. The cases filed are as follows:

Jabo’s Pharmacy, Inc., et. al. v. Becton Dickinson &
Company

(Case No. 2:05-CV-00162, U.S. District Court, Greenville, Tennessee), filed on June 7,
2005;

Drug Mart Tallman, Inc., et. al. v. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Case No. 2:06-CV-00174,
U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on January 17, 2006;

Medstar v. Becton Dickinson

(Case No. 06-CV-03258-JLL (RJH), U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on May 18, 2006;
and

The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale v. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Case No. 07-CV-2544,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York), filed on March 28, 2007. A fifth purported
class action on behalf of indirect purchasers

International Multiple Sclerosis Management Practice
v. Becton Dickinson & Company

(Case No. 2:07-cv-10602, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey),
filed on April 5, 2007 was voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiff.

The plaintiffs in each of the antitrust class action lawsuits seek monetary damages. All of
the antitrust class action lawsuits have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a
Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in Federal court in New Jersey.

On April 27, 2009, BD entered into a settlement agreement with the direct purchaser plaintiffs
in these actions. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, which is subject to preliminary and
final approval by the court following notice to potential class members, BD will pay $45 million
into a settlement fund in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct
purchaser claims related to the products and acts enumerated in the Complaint, as well as a
dismissal of the case with prejudice. The release would not cover potential class members that
affirmatively opt out of the settlement. No settlement has been reached to date with the indirect
purchaser plaintiffs in these cases, which will continue to the extent these cases relate to their
claims. On May 7, 2009, certain indirect purchaser plaintiffs in the litigation, who are not
parties to the settlement, filed a motion with the court seeking to enjoin the consummation of the
settlement agreement on the grounds that, among other things, the court had not yet ruled on the
issue of which plaintiffs have direct purchaser standing. The Court has scheduled a hearing on the
indirect plaintiffs’ motions regarding direct purchaser standing and the proposed injunction of the
settlement for February of 2010.

In June 2007, Retractable Technologies, Inc. (“RTI”) filed a complaint against BD under the
caption

Retractable Technologies, Inc. vs. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Civil Action No.
2:07-cv-250, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas). RTI alleges that the BD
Integra

TM

syringes infringe patents licensed exclusively to RTI. In its complaint, RTI
also alleges that BD engaged in false advertising with respect to certain of BD’s safety-engineered
products in violation of the Lanham Act; acted to exclude RTI from various product markets and to
maintain its market share through, among other things, exclusionary contracts in violation of state
and federal antitrust laws; and engaged in unfair competition. In January 2008, the court granted
BD’s motion to sever the patent and non-patent claims into separate cases. The non-patent claims
have been stayed, pending resolution of RTI’s patent claims. RTI seeks money damages and
injunctive relief. On April 1, 2008, RTI filed a complaint against BD under the caption

Retractable
Technologies, Inc. and Thomas J. Shaw v. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Civil Action No.2:08-cv-141,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas). RTI alleges that the BD Integra

TM

syringes infringe another patent licensed exclusively to RTI. RTI seeks money damages and
injunctive relief. On August 29, 2008, the court ordered the consolidation of these two cases. On
November 9, 2009, at a trial of these consolidated cases, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of
RTI on all but one of its infringement claims, but did not find any willful infringement, and
awarded RTI $5 million in damages. We plan to appeal the jury verdict.

BD, along with another manufacturer and several medical product distributors, is named as a
defendant in a product liability class action lawsuit relating to healthcare workers who allegedly
sustained accidental needlesticks, but have not become infected with any disease

(Bales vs. Becton
Dickinson et. al.

(Case No. 98-CP-40- 4343, Richland County
Court of Common Pleas) filed November 25, 1998). The action
alleges that healthcare workers have sustained needlesticks using hollow-bore needle devices
manufactured by BD and, as a result, require medical testing, counseling and/or treatment.
Plaintiffs seek money damages. There is no current activity in this case. BD continues to oppose
class action certification in this case, including pursuing all appropriate rights of appeal.

BD, along with a number of other manufacturers, was named as a defendant in approximately 524
product liability lawsuits in various state and Federal courts related to natural rubber latex
gloves which BD ceased manufacturing in 1995. Cases pending in Federal court are being coordinated
under the matter

In re Latex Gloves Products Liability Litigation

(MDL Docket No. 1148) in
Philadelphia, and analogous procedures have been implemented in the state courts of California,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Generally, these actions allege that medical personnel have
suffered allergic reactions ranging from skin irritation to anaphylaxis as a result of exposure to
medical gloves containing natural rubber latex. Since the inception of this litigation, all but
eleven of these cases have either been closed with no liability to BD or been settled for amounts
that, in the aggregate, are immaterial.

On May 28, 2004, Therasense, Inc. (“Therasense”) filed suit against BD (

Therasense, Inc. and
Abbott Laboratories v. Nova Biomedical Corporation and Becton, Dickinson and Company

(Case Number:
C 04-02123 WDA, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California)) asserting that BD’s blood
glucose monitoring products (a product line no longer sold by BD) infringe four Therasense patents
and seeking money damages. On August 10, 2004, in response to a motion filed by Therasense in the
U.S. District



Court for the District of Massachusetts, the court transferred to the court in California an action
previously filed by BD against Therasense requesting a declaratory judgment that BD’s products do
not infringe the Therasense patents and that the Therasense patents are invalid. On April 4, 2008,
the Court granted BD summary judgment with respect to two of the patents asserted against BD,
finding no infringement by BD. On June 24, 2008, the Court ruled that a third patent asserted
against BD was invalid and unenforceable. On August 8, 2008, a jury delivered a verdict in BD’s
favor, finding that the last of the four patents asserted against BD was invalid. The plaintiffs
have appealed these decisions.

On October 19, 2009, Gen-Probe Incorporated (“Gen-Probe”) filed a patent infringement action
against BD in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The
complaint alleges that certain specimen collection products of BD infringe eight U.S. patents of
Gen-Probe. Gen-Probe is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.

On September 19, 2007, BD was served with a qui tam complaint filed by a private party against
BD in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, alleging violations of the
Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) and the Texas False Claims Act (the “TFCA”) (

U.S. ex rel
Fitzgerald v. BD et al.

(Civil Action No. 3:03-CV-1589, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Texas). The suit alleges that a group purchasing organization’s practices with its suppliers,
including BD, inflated the costs of healthcare reimbursement. Under the FCA, the United States
Department of Justice, Civil Division has a certain period of time in which to decide whether to
join the claim against BD as an additional plaintiff; to date, it has not done so. A similar
process is followed under the TFCA; to date, the State of Texas has not availed itself of that
process. In September 2008, the Court dismissed certain of the plaintiff’s claims, but denied BD’s
motion to dismiss with respect to other claims.

BD believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the above-mentioned suits pending
against BD and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters.

BD is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims
that arise in the ordinary course of business.

BD is a party to a number of Federal proceedings in the United States brought under the
Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as “Superfund,” and
similar state laws. The affected sites are in varying stages of development. In some instances, the
remedy has been completed, while in others, environmental studies are commencing. For all sites,
there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all
cleanup costs.

Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, BD is not able in all cases to estimate
the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to
which BD is a party. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, BD
establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of
environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). In view of the
uncertainties discussed above, BD could incur charges in excess of any currently established
accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. In the opinion of management,
any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on
BD’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

Company Overview

Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) is a global medical technology company engaged
principally in the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices, instrument systems and
reagents used by healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the
pharmaceutical industry and the general public. Our business consists of three worldwide business
segments — BD Medical (“Medical”), BD Diagnostics (“Diagnostics”) and BD Biosciences
(“Biosciences”). Our products are marketed in the United States and internationally through
independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales
representatives. References to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years, which
end on September 30.

BD management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies:

§

To increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater
benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers;

§

To improve operating effectiveness and balance sheet productivity;

§

To strengthen organizational and associate capabilities in the ever-changing
healthcare environment; and

§

To drive shareholder value through earnings per share growth and effective use
of shareholders’ funds.

Our efforts to increase revenues are focused on four specific areas of healthcare:

§

Reducing the spread of infection;

§

Advancing global health;

§

Enhancing therapy; and

§

Improving disease management.

In assessing the outcomes of these strategies and BD’s financial condition and operating
performance, management generally reviews quarterly forecast data, monthly actual results, segment
sales and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial
data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and
development, return on invested capital, and cash flows.



Worldwide revenues in 2009 of $7.2 billion increased 1% from the prior year and reflected
volume increases of approximately 5% and price increases of less than 1%, which were partially
offset by net unfavorable foreign currency translation of 4%, after factoring in hedge gains. Our
reported revenues reflect the effect current economic conditions are having on customer demand in
certain areas of our business. U.S. revenues increased 3% to $3.2 billion. Sales in the United
States of safety-engineered devices grew 4% to $1.1 billion in 2009, from $1.0 billion in 2008.
International revenues of $4.0 billion were relatively flat compared with the prior year and
reflected an estimated 7 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency translation, net of
hedge gains. International sales of safety-engineered devices grew 7% to $571 million in 2009 from
$534 million in 2008, and reflected an estimated 10 percentage points of unfavorable foreign
currency translation, net of hedge gains.

Our anticipated revenue growth over the next three years is expected to come from business
growth and expansion among all segments and regions of the world, and the development in each
business segment of new products and services that provide increased benefits to patients,
healthcare workers and researchers. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a
number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including geographical
expansion), develop innovative new products with higher gross profit margins across our business
segments, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. Numerous
factors can affect our ability to achieve these goals including, without limitation, economic
conditions in the United States and elsewhere, increased competition and healthcare reform
initiatives. Specifically, there are various healthcare reform proposals in the U.S. Congress that,
if enacted in their current form, would impose an excise tax on medical device manufacturers such
as BD.

We face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations
to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of the period. We purchase
forward contracts to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements. Gains or
losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying
hedged transactions.

During 2009, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most foreign currencies, primarily the Euro,
compared to rates from 2008. The resulting unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on
revenues in 2009 was mitigated to an extent by hedge gains, recorded in revenues, resulting from
our hedging activities. For further discussion refer to Note 10 to
the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.

Results of Continuing Operations

Comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2009 and 2008 are affected by the
following significant items that are reflected in our 2009 financial results:

•

During the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $20 million, or
8 cents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, relating to various tax
settlements in multiple jurisdictions.

•

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $45 million, or 11
cents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations associated with the pending
settlement with the direct purchaser plaintiffs (which includes BD’s distributors) in
certain antitrust class actions.

Medical Segment

Medical revenues in 2009 of $3.7 billion increased $11 million, or 0.3%, over 2008, as volume
growth was mostly offset by an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 5
percentage points, net of hedge gains.

On a foreign currency-neutral basis, revenue growth of the Medical Surgical Systems unit
continues to be driven by sales in safety-engineered products and prefilled flush syringes.
Revenues of safety-engineered products increased 2% in the United States and 13% internationally,
which included an estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 12%, net of hedge gains.
Revenue growth in the Diabetes Care unit resulted primarily from worldwide pen needle sales.
Revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit was driven by growth in Europe and Asia Pacific,
offset by lower sales in the United States when compared to 2008, which included non-recurring
sales to companies producing certain generic heparin products. Revenues related to the H1N1
pandemic were $30 million for the Medical Surgical Systems unit and $25 million for the
Pharmaceutical Systems unit in 2009.

Medical operating income was $1.1 billion, or 29.7% of Medical revenues, in 2009, as compared
with $1.1 billion, or 28.3%, of revenues in 2008. Operating income as a percentage of revenues
reflected an increase in gross profit margin primarily resulting from favorable currency
translation, including hedge gains, and a modest benefit from lower raw materials cost, which was
partially offset by increased manufacturing start-up costs. See further discussion on gross profit
margin below. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of Medical revenues in 2009
declined to 17.3% of revenues from 17.8% of revenues in 2008, primarily due to tight spending
controls. Research and development expenses in 2009 increased $6 million, or 5%, reflecting
continued investment in the development of new products and platforms.

Diagnostics Segment

Diagnostics revenues in 2009 of $2.2 billion increased $66 million, or 3%, over 2008.
Revenues in 2009 reflected an estimated unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 4
percentage points, net of hedge gains.

Revenue growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit was driven by sales of safety-engineered
products. Sales of safety-engineered products grew 6% in the United States, driven by

BD
Vacutainer

Push Button Blood Collection Set sales and 4% internationally, which included an
estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 10%, net of hedge gains. The Diagnostics Systems
unit experienced growth in worldwide sales of its automated diagnostic platforms, including the
molecular

BD ProbeTec

,

BD



Viper

and

BD Affirm

systems, along with solid growth of its

BD BACTEC

blood culture and TB systems
and the

BD Phoenix

ID/AST platform. Revenues of flu-related products were $22 million in 2009. In
addition, revenues from TriPath grew $11 million to $130 million and revenues from GeneOhm grew $9
million to $51 million in 2009.

Diagnostics operating income was $607 million, or 27.3% of Diagnostics revenues in 2009,
compared with $526 million, or 24.3% of revenues in 2008. The Diagnostics Segment experienced an
improvement in gross profit margin from sales growth of products that have higher overall gross
profit margins, in particular, safety-engineered products and the

BD ProbeTec

and

BD Viper

systems.
This was partially offset by increases in raw material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange.
See further discussion on gross profit margin below. Selling and administrative expense as a
percentage of Diagnostics revenues in 2009 was 21.2% compared with 22.0% in 2008 primarily due to
tight spending controls. Research and development expense increased $10 million, or 7%, reflecting
continued investment in the development of new products and platforms with particular emphasis on
our molecular platforms.

Biosciences Segment

Biosciences revenues in 2009 of $1.2 billion increased $9 million or 1% over 2008, which
reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1 percentage point,
net of hedge gains.

Revenue growth in the Cell Analysis unit reflected lessening demand for instruments and
research reagents, caused primarily by adverse economic conditions in the U.S. that resulted in
funding constraints and lower demand for capital equipment. The unit was also impacted by reduced
research spending in other regions. Revenue growth in the Discovery Labware unit was adversely
impacted by reduced sales to a major bionutrients customer compared with 2008. Biosciences
revenues reflected a larger portion of our hedge gains, which are allocated to the segments based
on their proportionate share of international sales of U.S.-produced products.

Biosciences operating income was $362 million, or 30.1% of Biosciences revenues in 2009,
compared with $334 million, or 27.9% in 2008. The increase in operating income, as a percentage
of revenues, reflects gross profit improvement from the favorable impact of foreign currency
translation, including hedge gains. See further discussion on gross profit margin below. In
addition, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of Biosciences revenues declined in
2009 to 21.6% from 23.0% in 2008, primarily due to tight spending controls. Research and
development expense in 2009 was flat compared to 2008.

Geographic Revenues

Revenues in the United States in 2009 of $3.2 billion increased 3%. Overall, growth was led
by sales of safety-engineered products, which increased 4% to $1.1 billion, as well as sales of
Diabetes Care products. Revenue growth was adversely impacted by lower sales of immunocytometry
instruments and reagents and Pharmaceutical Systems products, as previously discussed.

International revenues in 2009 of $4.0 billion were relatively flat compared with the prior
year, as increased sales volume was offset by an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency
translation of 7 percentage points, net of hedge gains. Volume growth was led by sales in Western
Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America in 2009. International sales of safety-engineered devices
grew



7% to $571 million in 2009 from $534 million in 2008 and reflected an estimated 10 percentage
points of unfavorable foreign currency translation.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin increased to 52.6% in 2009, from 51.3% in 2008. Gross profit margin in
2009 reflected an estimated favorable impact of 140 basis points from both foreign currency
translation and the hedging of certain foreign currencies and 20 basis points from lower raw
materials cost. Partially offsetting these gains were increases in manufacturing start-up costs of
approximately 30 basis points.

Operating Expenses

Selling and administrative expense was $1.7 billion, or 23.8% of revenues, in 2009 compared
with $1.7 billion, or 24.0% of revenues in 2008. Aggregate expenses reflected the $45 million
litigation charge previously discussed and $48 million of increased core spending. These increases
were partially offset by $84 million of favorable foreign exchange impacts.

Research and development (“R&D”) expense in 2009 was $408 million, or 5.7% of revenues,
compared with $396 million, or 5.6% of revenues, in 2008. The increase in R&D expenditures includes
spending for new products and platforms in the Medical and Diagnostics segments, as previously
discussed.

Operating Income

Operating margin in 2009 was 23.0% of revenues, compared with 21.7% in 2008. The litigation
charge noted above decreased operating margin in 2009 by 70 basis points.

Non-Operating Expense and Income

Interest expense was $40 million in 2009, compared with $36 million in 2008. This increase
reflected higher debt levels offset, in part, by lower interest rates on floating rate debt.
Interest income was $33 million in 2009, compared with $39 million in 2008. This decrease was
attributable to the impact of lower interest rates on floating rate investments, partially offset
by a benefit from investment gains on assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. A
related increase in the deferred compensation plan liability was recorded as an increase in selling
and administrative expenses.

Income Taxes

The
effective tax rate in 2009 was 26.0% compared with the 2008 rate of 27.5%, and reflected a
1.2% benefit due to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions.

Discontinued Operations

In July 2009, the Company sold certain assets and liabilities related to the elastics and
thermometer components of the Home Healthcare product line of the Medical segment for $51
million. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial Statements
contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.

Income and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in
2009 were $1.2 billion and $4.92, respectively. The tax benefit discussed above increased income
from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 by $20
million, or 8 cents, respectively. The litigation charge discussed above decreased income from
continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 by $28
million, or 11 cents, respectively. Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per
share from continuing operations in 2008 were $1.1 million and $4.42, respectively.

Financial Instrument Market Risk



We selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk, primarily foreign currency
exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations. The
counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

BD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe,
Asia Pacific, Canada, Japan and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect
of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are
denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables
primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures
primarily through the use of forward contracts and options. We also face currency exposure that
arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, specifically sales, to the U.S.
dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. To
partially protect against a reduction in the value of future sales resulting from adverse foreign
exchange rate movements, we purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted
sales that are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains or losses on our derivative instruments
are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions.

Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign
currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an
assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated
based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for
similar assets and liabilities. With respect to the derivative instruments outstanding at
September 30, 2009, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar over a one-year period would increase
pre-tax earnings by $85 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would decrease pre-tax
earnings by $85 million. Comparatively, considering our derivative instruments outstanding at
September 30, 2008, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar over a one-year period would have
increased pre-tax earnings by $91 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would have
decreased pre-tax earnings by $91 million. These calculations do not reflect the impact of
exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results
of the derivative instruments.

Our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest
rates. Our debt and interest-bearing investments at September 30, 2009, are substantially all U.S.
dollar-denominated. Therefore, transaction and translation exposure relating to such instruments
is minimal. When managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance
between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help
maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items
have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments,
fair values are provided by the financial institutions that are counterparties to these
arrangements. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair
value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities. A change in interest rates on
short-term debt and interest-bearing investments impacts our earnings and cash flow, but not the
fair value of these instruments because of their limited duration. A change in interest rates on
long-term debt is assumed to impact the fair value of the debt but not our earnings or cash flow
because the interest on such obligations is fixed. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at
September 30, 2009 and 2008, a change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on
our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period. An increase of 10% in interest rates would
decrease the fair value of our long-term debt and interest rate swaps at September 30, 2009 and
2008 by approximately $66 million and $35 million, respectively. A 10% decrease in interest rates
would increase the fair value of our long-term debt and interest rate swaps at September 30, 2009
and 2008 by approximately $71 million and $39 million, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, is expected to
be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including capital expenditures, cash dividends
and common stock repurchases in 2010.

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2009 was $1.7 billion, unchanged from
2008. Net income, excluding non-cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, share-based
compensation and deferred income taxes), was the primary source of operating cash flow during 2009.
The change in operating assets and liabilities was a net use of cash and reflected higher levels
of accounts receivable and inventory. Accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher sales
in the fourth quarter of 2009, particularly in Europe. Inventory levels increased primarily due to
a build up of inventory in anticipation of orders relating to the H1N1 pandemic and seasonal flu
products.

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Investing Activities

Net cash used for continuing investing activities in 2009 was $1.1 billion, compared with $783
million in 2008. Capital expenditures were $591 million in 2009, compared with $602 million in
2008. Capital spending for the Medical, Diagnostics and Biosciences segments was $414 million,
$102 million and $56 million, respectively, in 2009 and related primarily to manufacturing



capacity expansions. The increase in cash used for purchases of short-term investments is
primarily related to the temporary investment of proceeds from the long-term debt issuance
discussed below. The increase in cash used for capital software investment is primarily related to
our enterprise-wide program to upgrade our business information systems.

In November 2009, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of HandyLab, Inc., a company that
develops and manufactures molecular diagnostic assays and automation platforms. The purchase price
was $275 million in cash. For further discussion refer to Note 3
to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $80 million in 2009, as compared with $586 million
in 2008. In May 2009, we issued $500 million of 10-year, 5.00% Notes and $250 million of 30-year,
6.00% Notes, the proceeds of which were used to repay $200 million of 7.15% Notes, due October 1,
2009, to fund a discretionary pension contribution of $175 million in October 2009, and for other
general corporate purposes. Total debt was $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion at September 30, 2009 and
2008, respectively. Short-term debt increased to 21% of total debt at year-end, from 17% at the
end of 2008. Floating rate debt was 32% of total debt at the end of 2009 and 35% at the end of
2008. Our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2009 was 4.9%, unchanged from the end
of 2008. Debt-to-capitalization at year-end increased to 26.8% compared to 18.8% last year
primarily due to our debt issuance.

We have in place a commercial paper borrowing program that is available to meet our short-term
financing needs, including working capital requirements. Borrowings outstanding under this program
were $200 million at September 30, 2009. We maintain a $1 billion syndicated credit facility in
order to provide backup support for our commercial paper program and for other general corporate
purposes. This credit facility expires in December 2012 and includes a single financial covenant
that requires BD to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio (ratio of earnings before income
taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense) of not less than 5-to-1 for the most
recent four consecutive fiscal quarters. On the last eight measurement dates, this ratio had
ranged from 26-to-1 to 34-to-1. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at
September 30, 2009. In addition, we have informal lines of credit outside the United States.

At September 30, 2009, Standard and Poor’s rated our long-term debt “AA-” and our commercial
paper “A-1+.” Our Moody’s ratings at September 30, 2009 were “A2” for long-term debt and “P-1” for
commercial paper. The outlook from both agencies was “stable.”

We repurchased shares of our common stock for approximately $550 million in 2009 and $450
million in 2008. At September 30, 2009, approximately 7.6 million common shares remained available
for purchase under a November 2008 Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase up to 10 million
common shares.

BD’s ability to generate cash flow from operations, issue debt, enter into other financing
arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the
event there was a material decline in the demand for BD’s products, deterioration in BD’s key
financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions. While
a deterioration in the Company’s credit ratings would increase the costs associated with
maintaining and borrowing under its existing credit arrangements, such a downgrade would not affect
the Company’s ability to draw on these credit facilities, nor would it result in an acceleration of
the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt. BD  believes that given its debt
ratings, its conservative financial management policies, its ability to generate cash flow and the
non-cyclical, geographically diversified nature of its businesses, the Company would have access to
additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise.

Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to
make payments in the future. The table below sets forth BD’s significant contractual obligations

2008 Compared With 2007

Worldwide revenues in 2008 of $7.1 billion increased 13% from 2007 and reflected volume
increases of approximately 7%, an estimated increase due to favorable foreign currency translation
of 6% and price decreases of less than 1%.

Medical Segment

Medical revenues in 2008 of $3.7 billion increased $376 million, or 11%, over 2007, which
includes an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 6 percentage points.

Medical revenues reflected the growth of the Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care units,
primarily outside of the United States, and the continued global conversion to safety-engineered
products. The Pharmaceutical Systems unit grew by 19%, driven by growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific
offset by lower growth in the United States when compared to fiscal 2007, which



reflected very high growth to support customer product launches. Revenue growth in the
Diabetes Care unit of 12% was driven primarily by double-digit growth in all regions outside of the
United States. Revenue in the Medical Surgical Systems unit was primarily driven by growth in
safety-engineered products and prefilled flush syringes. Sales of safety-engineered products
increased 3% in the United States and 38% internationally.

Medical operating income was $1.1 billion, or 28.3% of Medical revenues, in 2008, as compared
with $1.0 billion, or 28.5%, of revenues in 2007. Operating income as a percentage of revenues
reflects declines in gross margin from increased costs of raw materials, inventory write-offs and
declines in sales of products that have higher overall gross profit margins. These items more than
offset favorable manufacturing efficiencies and controls on selling and administrative expenses.
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of Medical revenues in 2008 declined to 17.8% of
revenues from 18.7% of revenues in 2007, primarily due to tight spending controls. Research and
development expenses in 2008 increased $8.0 million, or 7%, reflecting continued investment in the
development of new products and platforms.

Diagnostics Segment

Diagnostics revenues in 2008 of $2.2 billion increased $255 million, or 13%, over 2007, which
reflected an estimated favorable impact of foreign currency translation of about 5 percentage
points.

Revenue growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit was driven by the continued conversion to
safety-engineered products. Sales of safety-engineered products reflected growth of 7% in the
United States, driven by

BD Vacutainer

Push Button Blood Collection Set conversion activity, and
25% internationally. The Diagnostic Systems unit experienced growth in worldwide sales of its
automated diagnostic platforms, including the molecular

BD ProbeTec

,

BD Viper

and

BD Affirm

systems, along with solid growth of its

BD BACTEC

blood culture and TB systems and the

BD Phoenix

ID/AST platform. In addition, revenues from TriPath grew $31 million to $119 million and revenues
from GeneOhm grew $21 million to $42 million in 2008.

Diagnostics operating income was $526 million, or 24.3% of Diagnostics revenues in 2008,
compared with $343 million, or 18.0% of revenues in 2007. Segment operating income reflects the
in-process research and development charges of $115 million in 2007 related to the TriPath
acquisition. The Diagnostics Segment experienced a slight improvement in gross profit margin from
sales growth of products that have higher overall gross profit margins, in particular,
safety-engineered products and the

BD ProbeTec

and

BD Viper

systems, and favorable foreign
exchange. These improvements were slightly offset by manufacturing start-up costs and increases in
raw material costs. See further discussion on gross profit margin below. Selling and
administrative expense as a percentage of Diagnostics revenues in 2008 was 22.0% compared with
22.4% in 2007 primarily due to tight spending controls. Research and development expense increased
$16 million, or 14%, reflecting continued investment in the development of new products and
platforms with particular emphasis on our molecular platforms.

Biosciences Segment

Biosciences revenues in 2008 of $1.2 billion increased $161 million, or 16%, over 2007, which
reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 6 percentage points.

Revenue growth in the Cell Analysis unit reflected strong sales of instruments and flow
cytometry reagents, driven by increased demand for research instruments and clinical reagents.
Revenue growth in the Discovery Labware unit reflected reduced sales to a major bionutrients
customer compared with 2007.

Biosciences operating income was $334 million, or 27.9% of Biosciences revenues in 2008,
compared with $259 million, or 25.0% in 2007. Segment operating income in 2007 included an
in-process research and development charge of $7 million relating to the Plasso acquisition. The
increase in operating income, as a percentage of revenues, reflects gross profit improvement from
relatively higher sales growth of products that have higher overall gross profit margins and the
favorable impact of foreign currency translation. See further discussion on gross profit margin
below. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of Biosciences revenues in 2008 was
23.0%, as compared with 24.0% in 2007, primarily due to tight spending controls. Research and
development expense in 2008 increased $11 million, or 15%, reflecting spending on new product
development and advanced technology.

Geographic Revenues

Revenues in the United States in 2008 of $3.1 billion increased 5%. U.S. sales of
safety-engineered devices grew 5% to $1.036 billion in 2008. Overall, growth was also led by
increased sales of immunocytometry instruments and reagents, diabetes care products and infectious
disease testing systems.

International revenues in 2008 increased 19% to $4.0 billion, reflecting an estimated impact
of favorable foreign currency translation of 11 percentage points. Volume growth was led by solid
sales in Europe and certain Asia Pacific countries in 2008. International sales of
safety-engineered devices were approximately $534 million in 2008, compared with $414 million in
2007.

Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin decreased to 51.3% in 2008, from 51.7% in 2007. Gross profit margin in
2008 as compared with 2007 reflected an estimated 0.7% unfavorable impact resulting from increased
costs of raw materials (primarily resins) and manufacturing start-up costs, and an estimated 0.1%
favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Increased sales of products with relatively
higher margins and productivity gains were partially offset by, among other things, asset
write-offs, resulting in an estimated net favorable impact of 0.2%.

Operating Expenses

Selling and administrative expense was $1.7 billion, or 24.0% of revenues, in 2008 compared
with $1.6 billion, or 25.2% of revenues in 2007. The increase in aggregate expenses for 2008
reflect an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $80 million, increases in base spending of $24
million, and expenses of $9 million associated with TriPath, which was acquired in December 2006.

Research and development (“R&D”) expense in 2008 was $396 million, or 5.6% of revenues,
compared with $360 million, or 5.7% of revenues, in 2007. The increase in R&D expenditures includes
spending for new programs in each of our segments, as previously discussed.



Operating Income

Operating margin in 2008 was 21.7% of revenues, compared with 18.9% in 2007. Operating income
of $1.2 billion in 2007 reflected $122 million of acquired in-process R&D charges, as further
discussed above, which lowered 2007 operating margin by 190 basis points.

Non-Operating Expense and Income

Interest expense was $36 million in 2008, compared with $46 million in 2007, reflecting a
decline in interest rates. Interest income was $39 million in 2008, compared with $46 million in
2007. The favorable impact of higher investment levels was more than offset by investment losses
in assets we hold to offset liabilities related to our deferred
compensation plan. The


 related reduction in the deferred compensation liability was recorded as a reduction in selling and
administrative expenses.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate in 2008 was 27.5% compared with the 2007 rate of 29.0%. The 2007 rate
reflected the non-deductibility of the acquired in-process R&D charges of $122 million, which was
partially offset by the impact of approximately 0.3% resulting from the retroactive reinstatement
of the research and experimentation tax credit.

Income and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in
2008 were $1.1 billion and $4.42, respectively. Income from continuing operations and diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations in 2007 were $842 million and $3.30, respectively.
The acquired in-process R&D charges decreased income from continuing operations and diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations in 2007 by $122 million and by $.48, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2008 of $1.7 billion, increased $435
million over 2007. The increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities
reflects improvements in accounts receivable and inventory.

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Investing Activities

Net cash used for continuing investing activities in 2008 was $783 million, compared with $1.0
billion in 2007. Acquisitions of businesses represented the net cash paid for the Cytopeia
acquisition in 2008 and for the TriPath acquisition in 2007. See Note
3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion on
acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $602 million in 2008, compared with $556 million in 2007.
Medical capital spending of $378 million and Diagnostics capital spending of $124 million in 2008
related primarily to various capacity expansions. Biosciences capital spending of $83 million in
2008 included spending on manufacturing capacity expansions.

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $586 million in 2008, as compared with $726 million
in 2007, and included the repurchase of shares of our common stock for approximately $450 million
in both years. Total debt was $1.2 billion at both September 30, 2008 and 2007. Short-term debt
decreased to 17% of total debt at year-end, from 18% at the end of 2007. Floating rate debt was
35% of total debt at the end of 2008 and 36% at the end of 2007. Our weighted average cost of
total debt at the end of 2008 was 4.9%, down from 5.7% at the end of 2007. Debt-to-capitalization
at year-end improved to 18.8% from 20.9% last year.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as
well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently,
actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on
historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the



carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For
any given estimate or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying
reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual
results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our
consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies
reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from product sales is typically recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the
customer. However, we recognize revenue for certain instruments sold from the Biosciences segment
upon installation at a customer’s site, as installation of these instruments is considered a
significant post-delivery obligation. In addition, for certain sales arrangements, primarily in
the U.S., with multiple deliverables, revenue and cost of products sold are recognized at the
completion of each deliverable: shipment, installation and training. These sales agreements are
divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is recognized upon the completion of each
deliverable based on the relative fair values of items delivered. Fair values are generally
determined based on sales of the individual deliverables to other third parties.

BD’s domestic businesses sell products primarily to distributors who resell the products to
end-user customers. We provide rebates to distributors that sell to end-user customers at prices
determined under a contract between BD and the end-user customer. Provisions for rebates, as well
as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when revenue is
recognized.

Impairment of Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews at least
annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Potential impairment is identified by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. At September 30, 2009, there
were no reporting units that were deemed to be at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test.
Intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present. Impairment reviews are
based on a cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment with respect to future
volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount
rates and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with
BD’s business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease
the estimated fair value of the asset, and potentially result in different impacts to BD’s results
of operations. Actual results may differ from management’s estimates.

Investments

We hold equity interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within or
adjacent to BD’s strategic focus. For investments in companies that are publicly traded, market
prices are available. However, for investments in companies that are not publicly traded, fair
value is difficult to determine. We write down an investment when management believes an
investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes
in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investments could result in an
inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment
charges in the future.

Tax Valuation Allowances

BD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a
deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax
provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted,
management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry back
and carry forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of
realization of a deferred tax asset.

Contingencies

We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise
in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability, antitrust and
environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well
as potential ranges of probable losses. We establish accruals to the extent probable future losses
are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party
recoveries). A determination of the amount of accruals, if any, for these contingencies is made
after careful analysis of each individual issue and, when appropriate, is developed after
consultation with outside counsel. The accruals may change in the future due to new developments
in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters.

Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate
the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to
which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur



charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess
liability insurance. Accordingly, in the opinion of management, any such future charges,
individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results
of operations and consolidated net cash flows.

Benefit Plans

We have significant net pension and other postretirement benefit costs that are measured using
actuarial valuations. Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate and expected
return on plan assets. Other postretirement benefit plan costs include assumptions for the
discount rate and healthcare cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the
amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 6 to
the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.

The discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as
of the measurement date (September 30). For the U.S. pension plan, we used a discount rate of
5.90% as of September 30, 2009, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific
yield curve. The rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the measurement date and for
calculating the following year’s pension expense. The expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets assumption, although reviewed each year, is changed less frequently due to the long-term
nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities
as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To
determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors,
including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns
on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. At September 30,
2009, we used a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.00% for the U.S.
pension plan. We believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors.

Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans
are as follows:

•

Discount rate — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions
held constant, would have an estimated $6 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on
the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost.

•

Expected return on plan assets — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with
other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $2 million favorable
(unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan cost.

Share-Based Compensation

Compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions is recognized in net income
using a fair value measurement method. All share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense
(based on their fair values) over the vesting period of the awards. We determine the fair value of
certain share-based awards using a lattice-based binomial option valuation model that incorporates
certain assumptions, such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend
yield and expected life of the options. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

BD and its representatives may from time-to-time make certain forward-looking statements in
publicly released materials, both written and oral, including
statements contained in   filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press
releases and  our reports to shareholders.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan,” “expect,”
“believe,” “intend,” “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in
conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance,
as well as our strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position and
expenditures. All statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we
expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth,
sales and earnings per share growth, cash flows or uses, and statements expressing views about
future operating results — are forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The
forward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management’s then-current views and
assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates.
Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and
projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking
statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and
developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations.



The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from
our expectations in any forward-looking statements.

•

The current economic downturn and continued instability in the global financial markets and
the potential adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources for BD or its customers and
suppliers, the cost of operating our business, the demand for our products and services, or
the ability to produce our products. This includes the impact on developing countries and
their demand for our products.

•

The effects, if any, of healthcare reform in the U.S., including various proposals that, if
enacted, would impose an excise tax on medical device manufacturers such as BD. Other
legislative or administrative reforms in the U.S. or abroad could also reduce reimbursement
rates, result in increased pricing pressures or otherwise adversely affect BD’s business.

•

Changes in domestic and foreign healthcare industry practices that result in increased
pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and trends
toward managed care and healthcare cost containment.

•

Regional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation and
fluctuations in interest rates and, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates and the
potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins, as well as
competition in certain markets.

•

The effects of natural disasters, including the current influenza pandemic and other
pandemic diseases, earthquakes, fire, or the effects of climate change on our ability to
manufacture our products, particularly where production of a product line is concentrated in
one or more plants, or on our ability to source components from suppliers that are needed for
such manufacturing.

•

Fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as
well as certain sub-assemblies and finished goods, and the ability to maintain favorable
supplier arrangements and relationships (particularly with respect to sole-source suppliers)
and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items.

•

We operate in a highly competitive environment. New product introductions by our current
or future competitors (for example, new forms of drug delivery) could adversely affect our
ability to compete in the global market. Patents attained by competitors, particularly as
patents on our products expire, may also adversely impact our competitive position. Certain
competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers in low-cost
manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs. New entrants may also appear.

•

Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to
successfully continue technological innovation, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory
approvals in the United States and abroad, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new
products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of
encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect to patent or other intellectual
property rights, all of which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product.

•

We sell certain products to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are
sold with, products by such companies. As a result, fluctuations in demand for the products
of these pharmaceutical companies could adversely affect our operating results.

•

The effects, if any, of governmental and media activities regarding the business practices
of group purchasing organizations, which negotiate product prices on behalf of their member
hospitals with BD and other suppliers.

•

Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we
may undertake.

•

Our ability to implement the upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system. Any
delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our upgrade could adversely affect
our business.

•

Adoption of, or changes in, government laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign
operations, including those relating to trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation
(including tax reforms that could adversely impact multinational corporations), environmental
matters, sales practices, price controls, licensing and regulatory approval of new products,
regulatory requirements for products in the postmarketing phase, or changes in enforcement
practices with respect to any such laws and regulations. In particular, environmental laws,
particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are becoming more stringent
throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our
manufacturing plants or processes.

•

Fluctuations in U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences
research.



•

Pending and potential litigation or other proceedings adverse to BD, including antitrust
claims, product liability claims, patent infringement claims, and the availability or
collectibility of insurance relating to any such claims.

•

The effects of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BD’s business or
operations.

•

Our ability to achieve the projected level or mix of product sales. Our earnings forecasts
are generated based on such projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which
are more profitable than others.

•

The effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BD’s pension plans and the
possibility that BD may need to make additional contributions to the plans as a result of any
decline in the value of such assets.

•

Product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls, regulatory action on the
part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or foreign counterparts) or declining sales.

•

Political conditions in international markets, including civil unrest, terrorist activity,
governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders and
expropriation of assets by a government.

•

Our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets, which also depends on economic
and political conditions, and how well we are able to acquire or form strategic business
alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production
facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology.

•

The impact of business combinations, including acquisitions and divestitures, and our
ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.

•

Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
or the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to
achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it
is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a
complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.

Reports of Management

Management’s Responsibilities

The following financial statements have been prepared by management in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles and include, where required, amounts based on the best
estimates and judgments of management. The integrity and objectivity of data in the financial
statements and elsewhere in this Annual Report are the responsibility of management.

In fulfilling its responsibilities for the integrity of the data presented and to safeguard
the Company’s assets, management employs a system of internal accounting controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that the Company’s assets are protected and that
transactions are appropriately authorized, recorded and summarized. This system of control is
supported by the selection of qualified personnel, by organizational assignments that provide
appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibilities, and by the dissemination of
written policies and procedures. This control structure is further reinforced by a program of
internal audits, including a policy that requires responsive action by management.

The Board of Directors monitors the internal control system, including internal accounting and
financial reporting controls, through its Audit Committee, which consists of six independent
Directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent registered public
accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to review the work of each and to satisfy
itself that they are properly discharging their responsibilities. The independent registered
public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee
and meet with its members, with and without management present, to discuss the scope and results of
their audits including internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Act of 1934. Management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment and those
criteria, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
September 30, 2009.

The financial statements and internal control over financial reporting have been audited by

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

Becton, Dickinson and Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Becton, Dickinson and
Company as of September 30, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,
2009.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of Becton,
Dickinson and Company listed in Item 15(b).


These financial statements and schedule  are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements  and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Becton, Dickinson and Company at September 30,
2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September 30, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the guidance originally issued in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (codified in FASB Accounting
Standards Codification Topic 740-10 “Income Taxes —Overall”) on October 1, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), Becton, Dickinson and Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated November 25, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

Becton, Dickinson and Company

We have audited Becton, Dickinson and Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Becton, Dickinson and Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Becton, Dickinson and Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Becton, Dickinson and Company
as of September 30, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2009 of
Becton, Dickinson and Company, and our report dated November 25, 2009 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Becton, Dickinson and Company

Thousands of dollars, except per share amounts and numbers of shares

Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Becton, Dickinson and Company
and its majority-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) after the elimination of intercompany
transactions. The Company has no material interests in variable interest entities.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less at time of purchase.

Short-Term Investments

Short-term investments consist of time deposits with maturities greater than three months and
less than one year when purchased.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are principally provided on the straight-line basis
over estimated useful lives, which range from 20 to 45 years for buildings, four to 10 years for
machinery and equipment and one to 20 years for leasehold improvements. Depreciation and
amortization expense was $317,227, $305,252 and $280,110 in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment. Potential impairment is identified by comparing
the fair value of a reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value.
Core and developed technology is amortized over periods ranging from 15 to 20 years, using the
straight-line method. Both goodwill and core and developed technology arise from acquisitions.
Other intangibles with finite useful lives, which include patents, are amortized over periods
principally ranging from one to 40 years, using the straight-line method. These intangibles,
including core and developed technology, are periodically reviewed when impairment indicators are
present to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. To the
extent carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized in
operating results based upon the excess of the carrying value over fair value. Other intangibles
also include certain trademarks that are considered to have indefinite lives, as they are expected
to generate cash flows indefinitely, and are reviewed annually for impairment.

Capitalized Software

Capitalized software, including costs for software developed or obtained for internal use is
stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization expense is principally provided on the
straight-line basis over estimated
useful lives, which do not exceed 10 years. The current balance includes capital software
investments related to an enterprise-wide program to upgrade the Company’s business information
systems. Amortization expense was $46,739, $56,612 and $66,394 for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.



Foreign Currency Translation

Generally, the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current
exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such translation, as well as exchange
gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature, are included in the
foreign currency translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
The Company recognizes revenue for certain instruments sold from the Biosciences segment upon
installation at a customer’s site, as installation of these instruments is considered a significant
post-delivery obligation. For certain sales arrangements, primarily in the U.S., with multiple
deliverables, revenue and cost of products sold are recognized at the completion of each
deliverable: shipment, installation and training. These sales agreements are divided into separate
units of accounting. Revenue is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on the
relative fair values of items delivered. Fair values are generally determined based on sales of
the individual deliverables to other third parties.

The Company’s domestic businesses sell products primarily to distributors who resell the products
to end-user customers. Rebates are provided to distributors that sell to end-user customers at
prices determined under a contract between the Company and the end-user customer. Provisions for
rebates, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when
revenue is recognized.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in Selling and administrative expense. Shipping
expense was $255,744, $269,280 and $237,045 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

All derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value are
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

Derivative financial instruments are utilized by the Company in the management of its foreign
currency and interest rate exposures. The Company hedges forecasted sales denominated in foreign
currencies using forward and option contracts to protect against the reduction in value of
forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from export sales. The Company also periodically
utilizes interest rate swaps to maintain a balance between fixed and floating rate instruments.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes.

Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in income in the
period in which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized. In the event a designated hedged
item is sold, extinguished or matures prior to the termination of the related derivative
instrument, such instrument would be closed and the resultant gain or loss would be recognized in
income.

Income Taxes

United States income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
where such undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Deferred
taxes are provided for earnings of foreign subsidiaries when those earnings are not considered
indefinitely reinvested. Income taxes are provided and tax credits are recognized based on tax
laws enacted at the dates of the financial statements.

The Company maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion
of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in
the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management
evaluates factors such as prior



earnings history, expected future earnings, carry back and carry
forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization
of a deferred tax asset.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates or assumptions
affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as reflected in the consolidated
financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes the fair value of share-based compensation in net income. Compensation
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is
generally the vesting period.

Subsequent Events

The Company evaluates subsequent events and the evidence they provide about conditions
existing at the date of the balance sheet as well as conditions that arose after the balance sheet
date but before the financial statements are issued. The effects of conditions that existed at the
date of the balance sheet date are recognized in the financial statements. Events and conditions
arising after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued are evaluated
to determine if disclosure is required to keep the financial statements from being misleading. To
the extent such events and conditions exist, disclosures are made regarding the nature of events
and the estimated financial effects for those events and conditions. For purposes of preparing the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and the following notes to these financial
statements, the Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were
issued.

Note 2 — Accounting Changes

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) established the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification™ (the “Codification”) as the official source of authoritative
GAAP (other than guidance issued by the SEC) for all non-governmental entities. The Codification,
which changes the referencing of financial standards, supersedes pre-Codification authoritative
guidance. The Codification did not change or alter existing GAAP and did not result in a change in
accounting practice for the Company upon adoption on September 30, 2009.

In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding subsequent events (events or transactions occurring
after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued). The Company adopted
these requirements on June 30, 2009. The adoption of these requirements did not impact the
consolidated financial statements and the required disclosures are included in Note 1.

In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance requiring qualitative disclosures regarding how and why an
entity uses derivative instruments as well as disclosures detailing the entity’s accounting for
these instruments and related hedged items. Entities are also required to provide tabular
disclosures that quantify the effects derivative instruments and hedged items have on financial
position, financial performance, and cash flows. The Company
adopted the disclosure requirements on March 31, 2009 and there was no impact to the consolidated
financial statements as a result of such adoption. The required disclosures are included in Note
10.



In September 2006, the FASB issued new requirements relating to fair value measurements. The
guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands
disclosures relating to fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB deferred
implementation of fair value measurements, in accordance with the new requirements, for
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis
(at least annually) for one year. The Company implemented the fair value measurement requirements
for financial assets and liabilities, as well as other assets measured at fair value on a recurring
basis, on October 1, 2008. The effect of this adoption did not materially impact the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and the required disclosures are included in Note 11. The
Company is assessing the impact of adopting the fair value measurement requirements for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis, on October 1, 2009. The
impact to the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material.

On October 1, 2007, the Company adopted guidance relating to the financial statement recognition
and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Upon implementing
this guidance, the Company recognized a $5,084 increase in its existing liability for uncertain tax
positions, with a corresponding decrease to the October 1, 2007 retained earnings balance. The
Company also reclassified the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $71,782 from a current
liability account (Accrued expenses) to a non-current liability account (Deferred Income Taxes and
Other) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, in accordance with the new requirements. If the Company
were to recognize the unrecognized tax benefits, the effective tax rate would be favorably
impacted. At September 30, 2009, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was $50,547. The
Company does not anticipate any significant changes over the next 12 months to the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits. The Company includes interest and penalties associated with
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the Income tax provision on the Consolidated Statements
of Income.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax
audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. The IRS has completed its audit for the tax
years through 2005. For the Company’s other major tax jurisdictions where it conducts business,
the Company’s tax years are generally open after 2003.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

In December 2007, the FASB issued revised business combination rules which increase the use of fair
values in financial reporting and change how business acquisitions are accounted for. Certain
changes will introduce more volatility into earnings and could impact the company’s acquisition
strategy. The revised business combination rules are applicable to BD for any acquisitions for
which the acquisition date is on or after October 1, 2009. The new requirements are effective on a
prospective basis with limited exception relating to income tax uncertainties.

Note 3 — Acquisitions

Cytopeia

On May 12, 2008, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Cytopeia, Inc., a
privately-held corporation that develops and markets advanced flow cytometry cell sorting
instruments. The acquisition advances the Company’s position in rapidly emerging areas of
cell-based research, such as cell therapy research, stem cell research, drug discovery and
development, and marine biology. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and the results of operations of Cytopeia were included in the Biosciences segment’s
results as of the acquisition date. Pro forma information was not provided as the acquisition did
not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results. The purchase price was $42,914
in cash, including transaction costs. Cash assumed as of the valuation date was $1,655. The
purchase price was allocated based upon the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired.
The purchase price allocation resulted in a deferred tax asset of
$3,832, core and developed technology of $20,000, deferred tax liabilities of $7,904, primarily
associated with core and developed technology; and other net assets of $3,713, primarily consisting
of accounts receivable and inventory. Core and developed technology will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over its estimated useful



life of approximately 15 years. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired of $23,273 was recorded as goodwill. The
primary item that generated goodwill is the value of the Company’s access to new technologies and
capabilities related to cell therapy research. No portion of this goodwill is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes.

TriPath

On December 20, 2006, the Company acquired the outstanding shares (approximately 93.8%) of TriPath
Imaging, Inc. (“TriPath”) which it did not previously own. TriPath develops, manufactures, markets
and sells innovative solutions to improve the clinical management of cancer, including detection,
diagnosis, staging and treatment. The acquisition advances the Company’s position in cancer
diagnostics. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the
results of operations of TriPath were included in the Company’s results as of the acquisition date.
Pro forma information was not provided as the acquisition did not have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated results. The purchase price was $361,883 in cash, including transaction
costs and other consideration. The purchase price was allocated based upon the fair values of the
assets and liabilities acquired. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in deferred tax
assets of $75,261 primarily consisting of net operating loss carry-forwards and credits; core and
developed technology of $135,097; deferred tax liabilities of $52,662 primarily associated with
other intangible assets; and other net assets of $56,736 consisting primarily of cash and trade
receivables. Core and developed technology will be amortized on a straight-line basis over its
estimated useful life of approximately 15 years. The excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of the assets acquired of $32,712 was recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generated
goodwill are the value of expanded product opportunities in oncology that are aligned with and
complement ongoing research programs at the Company. The goodwill was allocated to the Diagnostics
segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. As a result of settling a preacquisition legal
contingency in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company received an upfront cash payment of $7,167.
The effects of this payment, as well as other minor purchase accounting adjustments, are reflected
in the purchase price allocation detailed above.

In connection with the acquisition, the Company also incurred a non-deductible charge of $114,739
for acquired in-process research and development. This charge, based on fair value, is associated
with three projects: molecular Pap test, breast staging, and ovarian cancer tests. These projects
had not yet reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future use at the
acquisition date. The portion of the charge allocated to each of these projects was $75,992,
$18,764 and $19,983, respectively.

The molecular Pap test uses proprietary molecular biomarkers and reagents that are intended to
allow for the primary screening of cervical cancer. The addition of biomarkers is intended to
improve sensitivity to allow the clinician to find disease more reliably. In February 2008, the
Company ceased activities on the clinical trial for this product. The Company presently
anticipates having a molecular Pap test commercially available both in the U.S. and outside the
U.S. after fiscal year 2011, assuming successful completion of new clinical trials on a new
platform and attainment of approval from FDA.

The ovarian cancer project, using proprietary biomarkers and reagents in a multiplex format, is
intended to allow for earlier stage detection of cancer. Information the Company expects to obtain
from tests developed in this project is designed to allow clinicians to begin treatment sooner. In
addition, the Company signed a development and supply agreement for access to certain biomarkers
that will be used in the Company’s product. The Company anticipates having an ovarian monitoring
test commercially available in the U.S. after fiscal year 2010, assuming successful completion of
clinical trials and attainment of clearance from FDA. Screening tests are expected to be
commercially available approximately two years thereafter.

The breast cancer project, using proprietary biomarkers and reagents, is intended to aid in disease
discovery in its earliest stages. Tests developed in this program will also be run on the
multiplex testing platform discussed above. Since the acquisition, the Company changed the focus
in this program from staging assay development to



screening assay development. The Company
anticipates having a breast assay both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in fiscal year 2015,
assuming successful completion of clinical trials and attainment of approval from FDA.

The fair values of these projects were determined based upon the present value of projected cash
flows utilizing an income approach reflecting the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate based on
the applicable technological and commercial risk of each project. These cash flows also took into
account the income and expenses associated with the further development and commercialization of
the underlying products. The range of discount rates assigned to the projects was 22 to 30 percent
and gave consideration to the underlying risk relative to the developed technology, the overall
commercial and technical risk, and the probabilities of success for each of the projects. The
ongoing activity associated with each of these projects is not expected to be material to the
Company’s research and development expense.

Plasso

On May 4, 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Plasso Technology, Ltd.
(“Plasso”), a privately-held company that was developing the next generation of surface-critical
research tools utilizing functional coating technology for applications in glycomics and cell
culture, for $10,425 in cash including transaction costs. In connection with the acquisition, the
Company incurred a non-deductible charge of $7,394 for acquired in-process research and development
associated with Plasso’s technology, for which, at the acquisition date, technological feasibility
had not been established and no alternative future use existed. Because Plasso was a development
stage company that had not commenced its planned principal operations, the transaction was
accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than as a business combination and, therefore,
goodwill was not recorded.

Subsequent Event

On November 19, 2009, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of HandyLab, Inc., a
company that develops and manufactures molecular diagnostic assays and automation platforms. The
purchase price was $275,000 in cash. HandyLab, Inc. has developed and commercialized a flexible
automated platform for performing molecular diagnostics which complements our molecular diagnostics
offerings, specifically in the area of healthcare-associated infections. The Company intends for
this acquisition to allow further expansion of the BD molecular diagnostic menu. Due to the
limited time since the acquisition date, the Company has not yet completed the initial accounting
for this business combination. The amounts recognized for major classes of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date will be provided in the Company’s condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the period ending December 31, 2009.

Note 4 — Divestitures

On July 8, 2009, the Company sold certain assets and liabilities related to the elastics and
thermometer components of the Home Healthcare product line of the Medical segment for $51,022. The
Company recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $18,145. Concurrent with the sale, the Company exited
the remaining portion of the Home Healthcare product line. The results of operations associated
with the Home Healthcare product line are reported as discontinued operations for all periods
presented in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows and
related disclosures.

On December 11, 2006, the Company sold the blood glucose monitoring (“BGM”) product line for
$19,971 and recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $15,226. During 2007, adjustments of $9,319 were
made to reduce sales returns and other accruals related to obligations that remained with the
Company upon divestiture of the product
line. Additionally, the Company received a payment of $4,675, which represented the resolution of
a contingency with a former supplier. Following the sale, the Company’s prior period Consolidated
Statements of Income and Cash Flows and related disclosures have been restated to separately
present the results of the BGM product line as discontinued operations.

Note 6 — Benefit Plans

The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees in
the United States and certain foreign locations. The Company also provides certain postretirement
healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying domestic retirees. Postretirement healthcare
and life insurance benefit plans in foreign countries are not material. The measurement date used
for the Company’s employee benefit plans is September 30.

During 2007, the Company redesigned its U.S. pension plans to provide for a cash benefit formula by
offering a one-time, irrevocable election to existing employees to change to this provision and
mandating all new employees hired after April 1, 2007 to participate in the new formula. The
Company also amended its other postretirement benefits plan to provide that new hires, as of April
1, 2007 or later, will no longer be eligible for company subsidized benefits. These amendments did
not have a material impact on the net pension and postretirement cost of the Company in 2007.

Net pension and other postretirement cost for the years ended September 30 included the following

obligations were $461,321 and $417,344 at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for
pensions plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan
assets were $1,473,574 and $1,042,707, respectively as of September
30, 2009 and $1,262,963 and $1,087,632, respectively as of September
30, 2008.




The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for
the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1,283,337,
$1,092,101 and $885,210, respectively as of September 30, 2009, and $260,253, $227,820 and
$135,442, respectively as of September 30, 2008.

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service credit for pension benefits that will be
amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into net pension costs over the next
fiscal year are expected to be $(41,833) and $1,065, respectively. The estimated net actuarial
loss and prior service cost for other postretirement benefits that will be amortized from
Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into net other postretirement costs over the next
fiscal year are expected to be $(3,405) and $(4), respectively.

Also used to determine other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan information.

At September 30, 2009 the assumed healthcare trend rates were 8% pre and post age 65,
gradually decreasing to an ultimate rate of 4.5% beginning in 2027. At September 30, 2008 the
corresponding assumed healthcare trend rates were 8% pre and post age 65, gradually decreasing to
an ultimate rate of 5% beginning in 2015. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare
cost trend rates in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of September 30, 2009 by $11,225 and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components
of 2009 annual expense by $694. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed healthcare cost
trend rates in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
September 30, 2009 by $10,111 and the aggregate of the 2009 service cost and interest cost by $617.

Expected Funding

The Company’s funding policy for its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts
sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that may be appropriate
considering the funded status of the plans, tax consequences, the cash flow generated by the
Company and other factors. While the Company will not be required to fund any of its pension plans
in 2010, the Company made a discretionary contribution of $175,000 to its U.S. pension plan in
October 2009.

Investment Strategy

The Company’s investment objective is to achieve superior returns on plan assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for
participants. The Company’s investments include a broad range of equity and fixed-income
securities. These investments are diversified in terms of domestic and international equity
securities, short-term and long-term securities, growth and value styles, as well as small and
large capitalization stocks. The Company’s target allocation percentages are as follows: equity
securities (58% — 69%); fixed-income securities (31% — 39%); and cash (0% — 3%). Equity securities
are held for their expected high return and excess return over inflation. Fixed-income securities
are held for diversification relative to equities. The plans may also hold cash to meet liquidity
requirements. Due to short-term fluctuations in market conditions, allocation percentages may
temporarily deviate from these target allocation percentages before a rebalancing occurs.
Investment risks and returns are measured and monitored on an on-going basis through annual
liability measurements and quarterly investment portfolio reviews to determine whether the asset
allocation targets continue to represent an appropriate balance of expected risk and reward.

The expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon expectations of long-term average rates of
return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption,
the Company considers many factors, including historical assumptions compared with actual results;
benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected
asset allocations.

Postemployment Benefits

The Company utilizes a service-based approach in accounting for most of its postemployment
benefits. Under this approach, the cost of benefits are recognized over the eligible employees’
service period. The Company has elected to delay recognition of actuarial gains and losses that
result from changes in assumptions.



Postemployment benefit costs for the years ended September 30 included the following components:

The unfunded status of the postemployment benefit plans, which are not funded, was $102,311 and
$76,286 at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The amounts recognized in Accumulated other
comprehensive (loss) income before income taxes for the net actuarial loss was $54,487 and $26,014
at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The estimated net actuarial loss that will be
amortized from the Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into postemployment benefit cost
over the next fiscal year is $6,080.

Savings Incentive Plan

The Company has a voluntary defined contribution plan (“Savings Incentive Plan”) covering
eligible employees in the United States. In connection with the redesign of the U.S. pension and
postretirement benefit plans, effective July 1, 2007, the Company amended its Savings Incentive
Plan increasing the amount of the Company matching contribution for eligible employees to 75% of
employees’ contributions, up to a maximum of 4.5% of each employee’s eligible compensation. Prior
to that date, the Company matched 50% of employees’ contributions, up to a maximum of 3% of each
employee’s salary. The cost of the Savings Incentive Plan was $36,438 in 2009, $31,526 in 2008 and
$21,878 in 2007. The Company guarantees employees’ contributions to the fixed income fund of the
Savings Incentive Plan, which consists of diversified money market instruments. The amount
guaranteed was $200,815 at September 30, 2009.

deferred tax assets of $156,288 and $85,311, respectively, were included in Other. Net current
deferred tax liabilities of $3,665 and $2,985, respectively, were included in Current Liabilities -
Income taxes. Net non-current deferred tax liabilities of $18,191 and $35,519, respectively, were
included in Deferred Income Taxes and Other. Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. At September 30, 2009, the
cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the United States
was $2.6 billion. Determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted
is not practicable. Deferred taxes are provided for earnings outside the United States when those
earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested.

The following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to
reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such
unrecognized tax benefits were settled:

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective
tax rate. Included in the above total is approximately $8,908 of interest and penalties, of
which approximately $1,312 are reflected in the current year statement of operations. BD does not
expect significant changes in the aggregate amount of unrecognized tax benefits that may occur
within the next twelve months, other than tax settlements.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax
audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. The IRS has completed its audit for the tax
years through 2005. For the Company’s other major tax jurisdictions where it conducts business,
the Company’s tax years are generally open after 2003.

Valuation allowances have been established for capital loss carryforwards, state deferred tax
assets, net of federal tax, related to net operating losses and credits and other deferred tax
assets for which the Company has determined it is more likely than not that these benefits will not
be realized. At September 30, 2009, the Company had deferred state tax assets for net state
operating losses and credit carryforwards of $45,543 for which a valuation allowance of $29,057 has
been established due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient taxable income in the state
jurisdictions to utilize the deferred tax assets before they principally expire between 2010 and
2014. In 2007, a previously established valuation allowance of approximately $19,700 related to
state tax credit carryforwards was reversed and included in the state and local income tax line
item in the following rate reconciliation table. The Company also has federal and state capital
loss carryforward deferred tax assets of $45,530 for which a full valuation allowance has been
established due to the uncertainty of recognizing the benefit from these losses before they
principally expire in 2010.

borrowings from financial institutions. The weighted average interest rates for Short-term debt
were 3.68% and 2.3% at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company has available a $1
billion syndicated credit facility with an expiration date in December 2012. This credit facility
provides backup support for the commercial paper program and can also be used for other general
corporate purposes. It includes a restrictive covenant that requires a minimum interest coverage
ratio, with which the Company was in compliance at September 30, 2009. There were no borrowings
outstanding under the facility at September 30, 2009. In addition, the Company had short-term
foreign lines of credit pursuant to informal arrangements of approximately $183,215 at September
30, 2009, almost all of which was unused.

In May 2009, the Company issued $500,000 of 10-year 5.00% notes and $250,000 of 30-year 6.00%
notes. The net proceeds from these issuances were used for the repayment of $200,000 in 7.15%
notes, due October 1, 2009. The proceeds will also be used for
general corporate purposes. A
swap agreement with a notional amount of $200,000 that was used to convert the payments on the
7.15% notes from the fixed rate to a floating rate also matured on the same date as the loan.

Note
10 — Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company adopted new disclosure requirements, relating to derivative instruments and hedging
activities on March 31, 2009. These new provisions require qualitative disclosures regarding how
and why an entity uses derivative instruments as well as how these instruments and related hedged
items are accounted for under hedge accounting rules. Entities are also required to provide
tabular disclosures that quantify the effects derivative instruments and hedged items have on
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.

Foreign Currency Risks and Related Strategies

The
Company has foreign currency exposures throughout Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, Japan and Latin
America. The Company partially hedges forecasted export sales denominated in foreign currencies
using forward and option contracts, generally with one-year terms. The Company’s hedging program
has been designed to mitigate exposures resulting from movements of the U.S. dollar, from the
beginning of a reporting period, against other foreign currencies. The Company’s strategy is to
offset the changes in the present value of future foreign currency revenue resulting from these
movements with either gains or losses in the fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts.
The Company’s option contracts expired in fiscal year 2008 and only forward contracts have been
utilized to hedge forecasted sales for fiscal years 2009 and 2010.

The Company designates forward contracts utilized to hedge these certain forecasted sales
denominated in foreign currencies as cash flow hedges. Changes in the effective portion of the
fair value of the Company’s forward contracts that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges
(i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a
particular risk) are included in Other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged transactions
are reclassified in earnings. These changes result from the maturity of derivative instruments as
well as the commencement of new derivative instruments. The changes also reflect movements in the
period-end foreign exchange rates against the spot rates at the time the Company enters into any
given derivative instrument contract. Once the hedged revenue transaction occurs, the gain or loss
on the contract is recognized from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to “Revenues”.
The Company records the premium or discount of the forward contracts, which is included in the
assessment of hedge effectiveness, to Revenues.

At September 30, 2009, the Company expects to reclassify $43,624, net of tax, of net losses on
foreign currency exchange instruments from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to
revenues during the next 12 months due to actual and forecasted export sales. In the event the
revenue transactions underlying a derivative instrument are no longer probable of occurring,
accounting for the instrument under hedge accounting must be discontinued. Gains and losses
previously recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) must be reclassified into Other
(expense) income. If only a portion of the revenue transaction underlying a derivative instrument
is no longer probable of occurring, only the portion of the derivative relating to those revenues
would no longer be eligible for hedge accounting.

Transactional currency exposures that arise from entering into transactions, generally on an
intercompany basis, in non-hyperinflationary countries that are denominated in currencies other
than the functional currency are mitigated primarily through the use of forward contracts and
currency options. Hedges of the transactional foreign exchange exposures resulting primarily from
intercompany payables and receivables are undesignated hedges. As such, the gains or losses on
these instruments are recognized immediately in income. The offset of these gains or losses
against the gains and losses on the underlying hedged items, as well as the hedging costs
associated with the derivative instruments, are recognized in Other (expense) income

The total notional amount of the Company’s outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of September
30, 2009 was $2,601,109.



Interest Rate Risks and Related Strategies

The Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar
interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable
rate debt. The Company periodically utilizes interest rate swaps to manage such exposures. Under
these interest rate swaps, the Company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between
fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal
amount. These swaps are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges.

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges (i.e., hedges against the exposure to
changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is
attributable to a particular risk), changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset
changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in market interest rates.

Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging
the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular
risk) are offset by amounts recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). If interest rate
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are terminated, the balance in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) attributable to those derivatives is reclassified into earnings over
the remaining life of the hedged debt. The amounts, related to terminated interest rate swaps,
expected to be reclassified and recorded in Interest expense within the next 12 months is $1,238,
net of tax.

As of September 30, 2009, the total notional amount of the Company’s outstanding interest rate
swaps designated as fair value hedges was $400,000. This amount includes the fixed-to-floating rate
swap agreement with a notional amount of $200,000 that matured with the Company’s repayment of
$200,000 in 7.15% notes, due October 1, 2009. The amount also includes a interest rate swap with a
notional amount of $200,000 that was entered into to convert the interest payments on $200,000 in
4.55% notes, due April 15, 2013, from the fixed rate to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR.
The Company had no outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of September
30, 2009.

Commodity Price Risks and Related Strategies

The Company also manages risks associated with certain forecasted commodity purchases by using
forward contracts. The Company has entered into a commodity forward contract on ethane to manage
the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of polyethylene used in the Company’s
manufacturing process. The contract is designated as a cash flow hedge and once hedged commodity
purchases occur, the gain or loss on the contract is recognized from Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) to “Cost of products sold.”

At September 30, 2009, the expected reclassification of net losses on the ethane forward contract
from Accumulated other comprehensive income to Cost of products sold during the next 12 months is
$22, net of tax. As of September 30, 2009, the notional amount of the Company’s commodity contract
was 206,000 gallons of ethane.

Risk Exposures Not Hedged

The Company purchases resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain
products. While the Company has been able to hedge certain purchases of polyethylene, the Company
does not currently utilize any hedges to manage the risk exposures related to other resins.
Significant increases in world oil prices that lead to increases in resin purchase costs could
impact future operating results.

Note 11 — Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements

The Company adopted issued fair value measurement requirements for financial assets and
liabilities on October 1, 2008. These provisions define fair value as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement provisions require the
categorization of assets and liabilities carried at fair value within a three-level hierarchy based
upon inputs used in measuring fair value.

The fair values of financial instruments, including those not recognized on the statement of
financial position at fair value, carried at September 30, 2009 are classified in accordance with
the fair value hierarchy in the table below:

The Company’s cash and equivalents include money market fund balances. The fair values of these
investments are based upon the quoted prices provided by the holding financial institutions. The
Company’s remaining cash equivalents and short-term investments are carried at cost, which
approximates fair value. The Company measures the fair value of forward exchange contracts and
currency options based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and forward
currency prices for similar assets and liabilities. The fair value of forward commodity contracts
and interest rate swaps are provided by the financial institutions that are counterparties to these
arrangements. The fair value of long-term debt is based upon quoted prices in active markets for
similar instruments.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash deposits in excess of government-provided insurance limits. Such cash
deposits are exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by financial institutions.  
Substantially all of the Company’s trade receivables are due from public and private entities
involved in the healthcare industry. Due to the large size and diversity of the Company’s customer
base, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited. The Company
does not normally require collateral. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by financial institutions with which it conducts business. However, this loss is
limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial
instrument contract exceed the obligations of the Company. The Company also minimizes exposure to
credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions.



Accounts receivable balances at September 30, 2009 include sales to government-owned or supported
healthcare
facilities in Greece of approximately $45,072, net of reserves. These sales are subject to
significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. The Company
understands that this is an industry-wide issue for suppliers to these facilities. If significant
changes occur in the availability of government funding, the Company may not be able to collect on
amounts due from these customers. This concentration of credit risk would not have a material
adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or liquidity.

thereafter.

As of September 30, 2009, the Company has certain future purchase commitments aggregating to
approximately $456,393, which will be expended over the next several years.

Contingencies

The Company is named as a defendant in five purported class action suits brought on behalf of
direct purchasers of the Company’s products, such as distributors, alleging that the Company
violated federal antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for the Company’s
products to the plaintiff and other purported class members. The cases filed are as follows:

Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Inc., et. al. vs. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Civil Action No.
05-1602, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on March 25, 2005;

SAJ Distributors, Inc.
et. al. vs. Becton Dickinson & Co.

(Case 2:05-CV-04763-JD, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania), filed on September 6, 2005;

Dik Drug Company, et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson and
Company

(Case No. 2:05-CV-04465, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on September 12,
2005;

American Sales Company, Inc. et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson & Co.

(Case No. 2:05-CV-05212-CRM,
U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania), filed on October 3, 2005; and

Park Surgical Co. Inc. et. al. vs. Becton,



Dickinson and Company

(Case 2:05-CV-05678- CMR, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania), filed on October 26, 2005. These actions have been consolidated under the caption

“In re Hypodermic Products Antitrust Litigation.”

The Company is also named as a defendant in four purported class action suits brought on behalf of
indirect purchasers of the Company’s products, alleging that the Company violated federal and state
antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for the Company’s products to the
plaintiff and other purported class members. The cases filed are as follows:

Jabo’s Pharmacy, Inc.,
et. al. v. Becton Dickinson & Company

(Case No. 2:05-CV-00162, U.S. District Court, Greenville,
Tennessee), filed on June 7, 2005;

Drug Mart Tallman, Inc., et. al. v. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Case No. 2:06-CV-00174, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on January 17, 2006;

Medstar v. Becton Dickinson

(Case No. 06-CV-03258-JLL (RJH), U.S. District Court, Newark, New
Jersey), filed on May 18, 2006; and

The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale v. Becton Dickinson
and Company

(Case No. 07-CV-2544, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York), filed on
March 28, 2007. A fifth purported class action on behalf of indirect purchasers

International
Multiple Sclerosis Management Practice v. Becton Dickinson & Company

(Case No. 2:07-cv-10602, U.S.
District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on April 5, 2007 was voluntarily withdrawn by the
plaintiff.

The plaintiffs in each of the antitrust class action lawsuits seek monetary damages. All of the
antitrust class action lawsuits have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District
Litigation (MDL) in Federal court in New Jersey.

On April 27, 2009, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the direct purchaser
plaintiffs in these actions. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, which is subject to
preliminary and final approval by the court following notice to potential class members, the
Company will pay $45,000 into a settlement fund in exchange for a release by all potential class
members of the direct purchaser claims related to the products and acts enumerated in the
Complaint, as well as a dismissal of the case with prejudice. The release would not cover potential
class members that affirmatively opt out of the settlement. No settlement has been reached to date
with the indirect purchaser plaintiffs in these cases, which will continue to the extent these
cases relate to their claims. On May 7, 2009, certain indirect purchaser plaintiffs in the
litigation, who are not parties to the settlement, filed a motion with the court seeking to enjoin
the consummation of the settlement agreement on the grounds that, among other things, the court had
not yet ruled on the issue of which plaintiffs have direct purchaser standing. The Court has
scheduled a hearing on the indirect plaintiffs’ motions regarding direct purchaser standing and the
proposed injunction of the settlement for February of 2010.

On June 6, 2006, UltiMed, Inc., a Minnesota company, filed suit against the Company in the U.S.
District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota (

UltiMed, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson and Company

(06CV2266)). The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the Company excluded the plaintiff
from the market for home use insulin syringes by entering into anticompetitive contracts in
violation of federal and state antitrust laws. The plaintiff sought money damages and injunctive
relief. On January 6, 2009, the Company and UltiMed entered into a settlement agreement for this
matter. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company paid $750.

In June 2007, Retractable Technologies, Inc. (“RTI”) filed a complaint against the Company under
the caption

Retractable Technologies, Inc. vs. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Civil Action No.
2:07-cv-250, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas). RTI alleges that the BD
Integra

TM

syringes infringe patents licensed exclusively to RTI. In its complaint, RTI
also alleges that the Company engaged in false advertising with respect to certain of the Company’s
safety-engineered products in violation of the Lanham Act; acted to exclude RTI from various
product markets and to maintain its market share through, among other things, exclusionary
contracts in violation of state and federal antitrust laws; and engaged in unfair competition. In
January 2008, the court granted the Company’s motion to sever the patent and non-patent claims into
separate cases. The non-patent claims have been stayed, pending resolution of RTI’s patent claims.
RTI seeks money damages and injunctive relief. On April 1, 2008, RTI
filed a complaint against BD under the caption

Retractable Technologies, Inc. and Thomas J. Shaw v.



Becton Dickinson and Company

(Civil Action No.2:08-cv-141, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Texas). RTI alleges that the BD Integra

TM

syringes infringe another patent licensed
exclusively to RTI. RTI seeks money damages and injunctive relief. On August 29, 2008, the court
ordered the consolidation of these two cases. On November 9, 2009, at a trial of these
consolidated cases, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of RTI on all but one of its infringement
claims, but did not find any willful infringement, and awarded RTI $5,000 in damages. The Company
plans to appeal the jury verdict.

The Company, along with another manufacturer and several medical product distributors, is named as
a defendant in two product liability lawsuits relating to healthcare workers who allegedly
sustained accidental needlesticks, but have not become infected with any disease. Generally, these
actions allege that healthcare workers have sustained needlesticks using hollow-bore needle devices
manufactured by the Company and, as a result, require medical testing, counseling and/or treatment.
In some cases, these actions additionally allege that the healthcare workers have sustained mental
anguish. Plaintiffs seek money damages in all of these actions. The Company had previously been
named as a defendant in nine similar suits relating to healthcare workers who allegedly sustained
accidental needlesticks, each of which has either been dismissed with prejudice or voluntarily
withdrawn. Regarding the two pending suits:

In Ohio,

Grant vs. Becton Dickinson et al.

(Case No. 98CVB075616, Franklin County Court), on
September 21, 2006, the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s grant of class
certification. The matter had been remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the
class can be redefined. On March 6, 2009, the Company and the plaintiff entered into a settlement
agreement, pursuant to which the Company paid $600.

In South Carolina, a suit has been filed on behalf of an unspecified number of healthcare workers
seeking class action certification in state court under the caption

Bales vs. Becton Dickinson et.
al.

(Case No. 98-CP-40- 4343, Richland County Court of Common Pleas), filed on November 25, 1998.
There is no current activity in this case.

The Company continues to oppose class action
certification in this case, including pursuing all appropriate rights of appeal.

The Company, along with a number of other manufacturers, was named as a defendant in approximately
524 product liability lawsuits in various state and Federal courts related to natural rubber latex
gloves which the Company ceased manufacturing in 1995. Cases pending in Federal court are being
coordinated under the matter

In re Latex Gloves Products Liability Litigation

(MDL Docket No. 1148)
in Philadelphia, and analogous procedures have been implemented in the state courts of California,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Generally, these actions allege that medical personnel have
suffered allergic reactions ranging from skin irritation to anaphylaxis as a result of exposure to
medical gloves containing natural rubber latex. Since the inception of this litigation, all but 11
of these cases have either been closed with no liability to the Company or been settled for amounts
that, in the aggregate, are immaterial.

On May 28, 2004, Therasense, Inc. (“Therasense”) filed suit against the Company (

Therasense, Inc.
and Abbott Laboratories v. Nova Biomedical Corporation and Becton, Dickinson and Company

(Case
Number: C 04-02123 WDA, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California)) asserting that the
Company’s blood glucose monitoring products (a product line no longer sold by the Company) infringe
four Therasense patents and seeking money damages. On August 10, 2004, in response to a motion
filed by Therasense in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the court
transferred to the court in California an action previously filed by the Company against Therasense
requesting a declaratory judgment that the Company’s products do not infringe the Therasense
patents and that the Therasense patents are invalid. On April 4, 2008, the Court granted the
Company summary judgment with respect to two of the patents asserted against the Company, finding
no infringement by the Company. On June 24, 2008, the Court ruled that a third patent asserted
against the Company was invalid and unenforceable.
On August 8, 2008, a jury delivered a verdict in the Company’s favor, finding that the last of the
four patents asserted against the Company was invalid. The plaintiffs have appealed these
decisions.



On October 19, 2009, Gen-Probe Incorporated (“Gen-Probe”) filed a patent infringement action
against BD in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The
complaint alleges that certain specimen collection products of BD infringe eight U.S. patents of
Gen-Probe. Gen-Probe is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.

On September 19, 2007, the Company was served with a qui tam complaint filed by a private party
against the Company in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, alleging
violations of the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) and the Texas False Claims Act (the “TFCA”)
(

U.S. ex rel Fitzgerald v. BD et al.

(Civil Action No. 3:03-CV-1589, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas). The suit alleges that a group purchasing organization’s practices with its
suppliers, including the Company, inflated the costs of healthcare reimbursement. Under the FCA,
the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division has a certain period of time in which to
decide whether to join the claim against the Company as an additional plaintiff; to date, it has
not done so. A similar process is followed under the TFCA: to date, the State of Texas has not
availed itself of that process. In September 2008, the Court dismissed certain of the plaintiff’s
claims, but denied the Company’s motion to dismiss with respect to other claims.

The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the above-mentioned suits pending
against the Company and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters.

The Company is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and
claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.

The Company is a party to a number of Federal proceedings in the United States brought under the
Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as “Superfund,” and
similar state laws. The affected sites are in varying stages of development. In some instances, the
remedy has been completed, while in others, environmental studies are commencing. For all sites,
there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all
cleanup costs.

Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, the Company is not able in all cases to
estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the
litigation to which the Company is a party. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, the Company establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in
the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). In view of
the uncertainties discussed above, the Company could incur charges in excess of any currently
established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. In the opinion of
management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows.

Note
15 — Share-Based Compensation

The Company grants share-based awards under the 2004 Employee and Director Equity-Based
Compensation Plan (“2004 Plan”), which provides long-term incentive compensation to employees and
directors consisting of: stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), stock options, performance-based
restricted stock units, time-vested restricted stock units and other stock awards.



The amounts and location of compensation cost relating to share-based payments included in
consolidated statements of income is as follows:

The associated income tax benefit recognized was $31,307, $36,236 and $37,179, respectively.
Share-based compensation attributable to discontinued operations was not material.

Stock Appreciation Rights

SARs represent the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock having a value equal to
the difference between the market price of common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise
price on the date of grant. SARs vest over a four-year period and have a ten-year term. The fair
value was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based binomial option valuation model that
uses the following weighted-average assumptions in 2009, 2008 and 2007: risk-free interest rate of
2.73%, 3.83% and 4.56%, respectively; expected volatility of 28%, 27% and 28%, respectively;
expected dividend yield of 2.11%, 1.35% and 1.37%, respectively, and expected life of 6.5 years for
all years. Expected volatility is based upon historical volatility for the Company’s common stock
and other factors. The expected life of SARs granted is derived from the output of the
lattice-based model, using assumed exercise rates based on historical exercise and termination
patterns, and represents the period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The
risk-free interest rate used is based upon the published U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of grant for instruments with a similar life. The dividend yield is based upon the most
recently declared quarterly dividend as of the grant date. The weighted average grant date fair
value of SARs granted during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $16.11 and $24.92 and $22.66, respectively.
The total intrinsic value of SARs exercised during 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $406, $2,122, and $321,
respectively. The Company issued 3,979 shares during 2009 to satisfy the SARs exercised. The
actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions from SAR exercises totaled $154, $808 and $103,
respectively. The total fair value of SARs vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $24,888, $16,429
and $9,073, respectively.

exercises totaled $16,931, $62,230 and $59,388, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock
options exercised during the years 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $53,630, $191,627 and $187,537,
respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $6,083,
$18,951 and $32,195, respectively.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units

Performance-based restricted stock units cliff vest three years after the date of grant. These
units are tied to the Company’s performance against pre-established targets, including its average
growth rate of consolidated revenues and average return on invested capital, over a three-year
performance period. Under the Company’s long-term incentive program, the actual payout under these
awards may vary from zero to 250% of an employee’s target payout, based on the Company’s actual
performance over the three-year performance period. The fair value is based on the market price of
the Company’s stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost initially recognized assumes that the
target payout level will be achieved and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the expected outcome
of performance-related conditions.

A summary of performance-based restricted stock units outstanding as of September 30, 2009, and
changes during the year then ended is as follows:

performance-based restricted stock units vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $33,712, $49,387 and
$9,181, respectively. At September 30, 2009, the weighted average remaining vesting term of
performance-based restricted stock units is 1.28 years.

Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units

Time-vested restricted stock units generally cliff vest three years after the date of grant, except
for certain key executives of the Company, including the executive officers, for which such units
generally vest one year following the employee’s retirement. The related share-based compensation
expense is recorded over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period or in the case
of certain key executives is based on retirement eligibility. The fair value of all time-vested
restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant.

restricted stock units vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $29,535, $26,674 and $3,392,
respectively. At September 30, 2009, the weighted average remaining vesting term of the
time-vested restricted stock units is 1.71 years.

The amount of unrecognized compensation expense for all non-vested share-based awards as of
September 30, 2009, is approximately $97,034, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average remaining life of approximately 2.02 years. At September 30, 2009, 4,295,402
shares were authorized for future grants under the 2004 Plan.

The Company has a policy of satisfying share-based payments through either open market purchases or
shares held in treasury. At September 30, 2009, the Company has sufficient shares held in treasury
to satisfy these payments in 2010.

Other Stock Plans

The Company has a Stock Award Plan, which allows for grants of common shares to certain key
employees. Distribution of 25% or more of each award is deferred until after retirement or
involuntary termination, upon which the deferred portion of the award is distributable in five
equal annual installments. The balance of the award is distributable over five years from the
grant date, subject to certain conditions. In February 2004, this plan was terminated with respect
to future grants upon the adoption of the 2004 Plan. At September 30, 2009 and 2008, awards for
114,197 and 161,145 shares, respectively, were outstanding.

The Company has a Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors which reserves for issuance of
300,000



shares of the Company’s common stock. No restricted shares were issued in 2009.

The Company has a Directors’ Deferral Plan, which provides a means to defer director compensation,
from time to time, on a deferred stock or cash basis. As of September 30, 2009, 86,643 shares were
held in trust, of which 4,356 shares represented Directors’ compensation in 2009, in accordance
with the provisions of the plan. Under this plan, which is unfunded, directors have an unsecured
contractual commitment from the Company.

The Company also has a Deferred Compensation Plan that allows certain highly-compensated employees,
including executive officers, to defer salary, annual incentive awards and certain equity-based
compensation. As of September 30, 2009, 557,235 shares were issuable under this plan.

Note 17 — Segment Data

The Company’s organizational structure is based upon its three principal business segments: BD
Medical (“Medical”), BD Diagnostics (“Diagnostics”) and BD Biosciences (“Biosciences”).

The principal product lines in the Medical segment include needles, syringes and intravenous
catheters for medication delivery; safety-engineered and auto-disable devices; prefilled IV flush
syringes; syringes and pen needles for the self-injection of insulin and other drugs used in the
treatment of diabetes; prefillable drug delivery devices provided to pharmaceutical companies and
sold to end-users as drug/device combinations; surgical blades/scalpels and regional anesthesia
needles and trays; critical care monitoring devices; ophthalmic surgical instruments; and sharps
disposal containers. The principal products and services in the Diagnostics segment include
integrated systems for specimen collection; an extensive line of safety-engineered specimen blood
collection products and systems; plated media; automated blood culturing systems; molecular testing
systems for sexually transmitted diseases and healthcare-associated infections; microorganism
identification and drug susceptibility systems; liquid-based cytology systems for cervical cancer
screening; and rapid diagnostic assays. The principal product lines in the Biosciences segment
include fluorescence activated cell sorters and analyzers; cell imaging systems; monoclonal
antibodies and kits for performing cell analysis; reagent systems for life sciences research; tools
to aid in drug discovery and growth of tissue and cells; cell culture media supplements for
biopharmaceutical manufacturing; and diagnostic assays.

The Company evaluates performance of its business segments based upon operating income. Segment
operating income represents revenues reduced by product costs and operating expenses. The Company
hedges against certain forecasted sales of U.S.-produced products sold outside the United States.
Gains and losses associated with these foreign currency translation hedges are reported in segment
revenues based upon their proportionate share of these international sales of U.S.-produced
products.



Distribution of products is primarily through independent distribution channels, and directly to
end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. No customer accounted for 10% or more of
revenues in any of the three years presented.
