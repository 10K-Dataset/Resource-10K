PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

Becton, Dickinson and Company (also known as “BD”) was
    incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in
    November 1906, as successor to a New York business started in
    1897. BD’s executive offices are located at 1 Becton Drive,
    Franklin Lakes, New Jersey

07417-1880,

and its telephone number is

(201) 847-6800.

All references in this

Form 10-K

to “BD” refer to Becton, Dickinson and Company and its
    domestic and foreign subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated by
    the context.

BD is a global medical technology company engaged principally in
    the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices,
    instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions,
    life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the
    pharmaceutical industry and the general public.

Business
    Segments

BD’s operations consist of three worldwide business
    segments: BD Medical, BD Diagnostics and BD Biosciences.
    Information with respect to BD’s business segments is
    included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements
    contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data, and is incorporated herein by reference.

BD
    Medical

BD Medical produces a broad array of medical devices that are
    used in a wide range of healthcare settings. BD Medical’s
    principal product lines include needles, syringes and
    intravenous catheters for medication delivery (including
    safety-engineered and auto-disable devices); prefilled IV
    flush syringes; syringes and pen needles for the self-injection
    of insulin and other drugs used in the treatment of diabetes;
    prefillable drug delivery systems provided to pharmaceutical
    companies and sold to end-users as drug/device combinations;
    regional anesthesia needles and trays; sharps disposal
    containers; and closed-system transfer devices. The primary
    customers served by BD Medical are hospitals and clinics;
    physicians’ office practices; consumers and retail
    pharmacies; governmental and nonprofit public health agencies;
    pharmaceutical companies; and healthcare workers.

BD
    Diagnostics

BD Diagnostics provides products for the safe collection and
    transport of diagnostics specimens, as well as instruments and
    reagent systems to detect a broad range of infectious diseases,
    healthcare-associated infections (“HAIs”) and cancers.
    BD Diagnostics’ principal products include integrated
    systems for specimen collection; safety-engineered blood
    collection products and systems; automated blood culturing
    systems; molecular testing systems for infectious diseases and
    women’s health; microorganism identification and drug
    susceptibility systems; liquid-based cytology systems for
    cervical cancer screening; rapid diagnostic assays; and plated
    media. BD Diagnostics serves hospitals, laboratories and
    clinics; reference laboratories; blood banks; healthcare
    workers; public health agencies; physicians’ office
    practices; and industrial and food microbiology laboratories.

BD
    Biosciences

BD Biosciences produces research and clinical tools that
    facilitate the study of cells, and the components of cells, to
    gain a better understanding of normal and disease processes.
    That information is used to aid the discovery and development of
    new drugs and vaccines, and to improve the diagnosis and
    management of diseases. BD Biosciences’ principal product
    lines include fluorescence-activated cell sorters and analyzers;
    monoclonal antibodies and kits for performing cell analysis;
    reagent systems for life science research; cell imaging systems;
    laboratory products for tissue culture and fluid handling;
    diagnostic assays; and cell culture media supplements for
    biopharmaceutical manufacturing. The primary customers served by
    BD Biosciences



are research and clinical laboratories; academic and government
    institutions; pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies;
    hospitals; and blood banks.

Acquisitions

During the second quarter of 2011, BD acquired 100% of the
    outstanding shares of Accuri Cytometers, Inc, a company that
    develops and manufactures personal flow cytometers for
    researchers. The fair value of consideration transferred totaled
    $205 million, net of cash acquired.

During the fourth quarter of 2011, BD acquired 100% of the
    outstanding shares of Carmel Pharma Inc., a Swedish company that
    manufactures the
    PhaSeal

®

System, a closed-system drug transfer device for the safe
    handling of hazardous drugs that are packaged in vials. The fair
    value of consideration transferred was $287 million, net of
    cash acquired.

Additional information regarding these acquisitions is contained
    in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements
    contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.

International
    Operations

BD’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. For
    reporting purposes, we organize our operations outside the
    United States as follows: Europe (which includes the Middle East
    and Africa); Japan; Asia Pacific (which includes Australia and
    all of Asia except Japan); Latin America (which includes Mexico
    and Brazil) and Canada. The principal products sold by BD
    outside the United States are needles and syringes; insulin
    syringes and pen needles; diagnostic systems; BD
    Vacutainer

tm

brand blood collection products;
    BD Hypak

tm

brand prefillable syringe systems; infusion therapy products;
    flow cytometry instruments and reagents; and disposable
    laboratory products. BD has manufacturing operations outside the
    United States in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
    Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, Singapore,
    South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Geographic
    information with respect to BD’s operations is included
    under the heading “Geographic Information” in
    Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in
    Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have
    caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to
    fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic
    revenues. BD believes its activities in some countries outside
    the United States involve greater risk than its domestic
    business due to the factors cited herein, as well as the
    economic environment, local commercial and economic policies and
    political uncertainties. See further discussion of this risk in
    Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Distribution

BD’s products are marketed in the United States and
    internationally through independent distribution channels and
    directly to end-users by BD and independent sales
    representatives. No customer accounted for 10% or more of
    revenues in fiscal year 2011. Order backlog is not material to
    BD’s business inasmuch as orders for BD products generally
    are received and filled on a current basis, except for items
    temporarily out of stock. BD’s worldwide sales are not
    generally seasonal, with the exception of certain medical
    devices in the BD Medical segment, and respiratory and flu
    diagnostic products in the BD Diagnostics segment, that relate
    to seasonal diseases such as influenza.

Raw
    Materials

BD purchases many different types of raw materials, including
    plastics, glass, metals, textiles, paper products, agricultural
    products, electronic and mechanical

sub-assemblies

and various biological, chemical and petrochemical products.
    Certain raw materials (primarily related to the BD Biosciences
    segment) are not available from multiple sources. In the case of
    certain principal raw materials that are available from multiple
    sources, for various reasons (including quality assurance and
    cost effectiveness), BD elects to purchase these raw materials
    from sole suppliers. In cases where there are regulatory
    requirements relating to qualification of suppliers, BD may not
    be able to



establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis.
    While BD works closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity
    of supply, the termination, reduction or interruption in supply
    of these sole-sourced raw materials could impact our ability to
    manufacture and sell certain of our products.

Research
    and Development

BD conducts its research and development (“R&D”)
    activities at its operating units and at BD Technologies in
    Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The majority of
    BD’s R&D activities are conducted in the United
    States. Outside the United States, BD conducts R&D
    activities at BD Diagnostic Systems in Quebec City, Canada and
    Suzhou, China, BD Pharmaceutical Systems in Pont de Claix,
    France, and BD Medical Surgical Systems in Tuas, Singapore. BD
    also collaborates with certain universities, medical centers and
    other entities on R&D programs, and retains individual
    consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields. BD
    spent approximately $476 million, $431 million and
    $405 million on research and development during the fiscal
    years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Fiscal 2011 spending included a $9 million charge
    resulting from the discontinuance of a research program.

Intellectual
    Property and Licenses

BD owns significant intellectual property, including patents,
    patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how,
    copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other
    countries. BD is also licensed under domestic and foreign
    patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets,
    know-how, copyrights and trademarks owned by others. In the
    aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are
    of material importance to BD’s business. BD believes,
    however, that no single patent, technology, trademark,
    intellectual property asset or license is material in relation
    to BD’s business as a whole, or to any business segment.

Competition

BD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical
    technology marketplace whose dynamics are changing.
    Technological advances and scientific discoveries have
    accelerated the pace of change in medical technology, the
    regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more
    complex and vigorous, and economic conditions have resulted in a
    challenging market. Companies of varying sizes compete in the
    global medical technology field. Some are more specialized than
    BD with respect to particular markets, and some have greater
    financial resources than BD. New companies have entered the
    field, particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics,
    safety-engineered devices and in the life sciences, and
    established companies have diversified their business activities
    into the medical technology area. Other firms engaged in the
    distribution of medical technology products have become
    manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well.
    Acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a
    competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment.
    In addition, the entry into the market of manufacturers located
    in China and other low-cost manufacturing locations are creating
    increased pricing pressures, particularly in developing markets.
    Some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or
    have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a
    means to lower their costs. New entrants may also appear,
    particularly from these low-cost countries.

BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many
    factors, including price, quality, innovation, service,
    reputation, distribution and promotion. The impact of these
    factors on BD’s competitive position varies among BD’s
    various product offerings. In order to remain competitive in the
    industries in which it operates, BD continues to make
    investments in research and development, quality management,
    quality improvement, product innovation and productivity
    improvement in support of its core strategy — to
    increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver
    greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers.

Third-Party
    Reimbursement

Healthcare providers and related facilities are generally
    reimbursed for their services through numerous payment systems
    managed by various governmental agencies worldwide (e.g.,
    Medicare and Medicaid in the



United States, the National Health Service in the United
    Kingdom, the Joint Federal Committee in Germany, the Commission
    d’Evaluation des Produits et prestations in France, the
    Ministry for Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan, the Ministry of
    Health and the National Development and Reform Commission in
    China, among many others), private insurance companies, and
    managed care organizations. The manner and level of
    reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care,
    the procedure(s) performed, the final patient diagnosis, the
    device(s)

and/or

drug(s) utilized, the available budget, or a combination of
    these factors, and coverage and payment levels are determined at
    each payer’s discretion. The coverage policies and
    reimbursement levels of these third-party payers may impact the
    decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which
    medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing
    to pay for those products. Thus, changes in reimbursement level
    or method may either positively or negatively impact sales of
    BD products.

While BD is actively engaged in promoting the value of its
    products for payers and patients, and it employs various efforts
    and resources to positively impact coverage, coding and payment
    processes in this regard, it has no direct control over payer
    decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for
    BD products. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to
    explore cost-containment strategies (e.g., comparative and
    cost-effectiveness analyses, so-called

“pay-for-performance”

programs implemented by various public and private payers, and
    expansion of payment bundling schemes such as Accountable Care
    Organizations (ACOs), DRG programs, and other such methods that
    shift medical cost risk to providers) that could potentially
    impact coverage

and/or

payment levels for current or future BD products.

As BD’s product offerings are diverse across many
    healthcare settings, they are affected to varying degrees by the
    many payment systems. Therefore, individual countries, product
    lines or product classes may be impacted by changes to these
    systems. Notably, the recently-enacted healthcare reform
    legislation in the United States (i.e., the Patient Protection
    and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”)) provides for
    numerous, substantive changes to U.S. healthcare payment
    systems. Many of the changes set forth in this statute have only
    recently been promulgated through formal regulations and most of
    them have yet to be implemented. At this time, it remains
    unclear whether, or how, the implementation of regulations
    pursuant to the PPACA might affect payments for BD products. See
    Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion.

Regulation

BD’s medical technology products and operations are subject
    to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies,
    as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies
    enforce laws and regulations that govern the development,
    testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and
    distribution, and market surveillance of BD’s medical
    products. The scope of the activities of these agencies,
    particularly in the Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific regions in
    which BD operates, has been increasing.

BD actively maintains FDA/ISO Quality Systems that establish
    standards for its product design, manufacturing, and
    distribution processes. Prior to marketing or selling most of
    its products, BD must secure approval from the FDA and
    counterpart

non-U.S. regulatory

agencies. Following the introduction of a product, these
    agencies engage in periodic reviews of BD’s quality
    systems, as well as product performance, and advertising and
    promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any
    changes in FDA policies, can affect the time and cost associated
    with the development, introduction and continued availability of
    new products. Where possible, BD anticipates these factors in
    its product development and planning processes.

These agencies possess the authority to take various
    administrative and legal actions against BD, such as product
    recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal
    sanctions. BD also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such
    as voluntary recalls.

BD also is subject to various federal and state laws, and laws
    outside the United States, concerning healthcare fraud and abuse
    (including false claims laws and anti-kickback laws), global
    anti-corruption, transportation, safety and health, and customs
    and exports. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have
    increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical
    device manufacturers in recent years. This



appears to be part of a general trend toward increased
    regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the
    United States.

BD believes it is in compliance in all material respects with
    applicable law and the regulations promulgated by the applicable
    agencies (including, without limitation, environmental laws and
    regulations), and that such compliance has not had, and will not
    have, a material adverse effect on our operations or results.
    See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Employees

As of September 30, 2011, BD had 29,369 employees, of
    whom 12,041 were employed in the U.S. (including Puerto
    Rico). BD believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

Other
    Matters

Becton Dickinson France, S.A. (“BD-France”), a
    subsidiary of BD, was listed among approximately 2,200 other
    companies in an October 27, 2005 report of the Independent
    Inquiry Committee (“IIC”) of the United Nations
    (“UN”) as having been involved in humanitarian
    contracts in which unauthorized payments were suspected of
    having been made to the Iraqi Government in connection with the
    UN’s

Oil-for-Food

Programme (the “Programme”). In connection with the
    IIC’s report, Becton Dickinson AG, a Swiss subsidiary of
    BD, received a letter of inquiry from the Vendor Review
    Committee (“VRC”) of the United Nations Procurement
    Service dated November 22, 2005. The letter of inquiry said
    that the VRC is reviewing Becton Dickinson AG’s
    registration status in light of BD-France being listed in the
    IIC’s report and asked us for any information we might be
    able to provide relating to the findings of the report. BD
    conducted an internal review and found no evidence that BD or
    any BD employee made, authorized, or approved improper payments
    to the Iraqi Government in connection with the Programme. The
    representative utilized by BD in Iraq also unequivocally denied
    having made any such payments, and BD was unable to find any
    evidence of such payments being made by this representative. BD
    reported the results of its internal review to the VRC. In
    May 2008, BD received a letter from the UN stating that
    Becton Dickinson AG had been suspended from the UN Secretariat
    Procurement Division’s vendor roster for a minimum period
    of six months. We have requested that Becton Dickinson AG be
    reinstated. BD believes that the suspension has not had, and
    will not have, a material adverse effect on BD.

In May 2007, the French Judicial Police conducted searches of
    BD-France’s offices in France with respect to the matters
    that were the subject of the 2005 IIC report. We were informed
    that BD-France is one of a number of companies named in the IIC
    report that is being investigated by the French Judicial Police.
    In June 2009, the Belgian Federal Police contacted BD to
    interview certain individuals and review documents related to
    sales made under the Programme. We are cooperating fully with
    these investigations.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and
    uncertainties. The following describes some of the significant
    risks that could adversely affect BD’s business, financial
    condition, operating results or cash flows.

Current
    economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our
    operations.

The global economic conditions may result in a decrease in the
    demand for our products and services, increased pricing
    pressure, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new
    technologies. During fiscal year 2011, our revenue growth was
    adversely affected by conditions in the healthcare industry,
    including lower healthcare utilization, particularly in the
    U.S. and western Europe, cost containment efforts by
    governments and other payors for healthcare services and other
    factors. These conditions resulted in weaker overall customer
    demand and increased pricing pressure for some of our products.
    We anticipate that these industry conditions will continue for
    the foreseeable future. In addition, while the economic downturn
    has not impaired our ability to access credit markets to date,
    there can be no assurance that these conditions will not
    adversely affect our ability to do so in the future. The current
    macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our
    suppliers, and there can be no assurances that BD will not
    experience any interruptions in supply in the future. We have
    also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain
    countries in western Europe, and we may experience similar
    delays in these and other jurisdictions experiencing liquidity
    problems. The continued weakness in world economies makes the
    strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain, and
    there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will
    not deteriorate further.

We are
    subject to foreign currency exchange risk.

Over half of our fiscal year 2011 revenues were derived from
    international operations. Our revenues outside the United States
    may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange
    rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may
    attempt to address any impact is contained in Item. 7,
    Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results
    of Operations. Any hedging activities we engage in may only
    offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from
    unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We
    cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks.

Changes
    in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect
    the demand for our products and the prices at which they are
    sold.

Our sales depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare
    providers and facilities are reimbursed by government
    authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for
    the costs of our products. The coverage policies and
    reimbursement levels of third-party payers, which can vary among
    public and private sources, may affect which products customers
    purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these
    products in a particular jurisdiction. Legislative or
    administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United
    States (as part of healthcare reform or otherwise, as discussed
    below) or abroad could significantly



reduce reimbursement for procedures using BD products, or result
    in denial of reimbursement for those products. See
    “Third-Party Reimbursement” under Item 1.
    Business.

Federal
    healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of
    operations.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the
    “PPACA”) was enacted in March 2010. Under the PPACA,
    beginning in 2013, medical device manufacturers, such as BD,
    will pay a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical
    devices. Sales of BD products that we estimate to be subject to
    this tax represented about 80% of BD’s total
    U.S. revenues in fiscal year 2011. We cannot predict with
    any certainty what other impact the PPACA may have on our
    business. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to
    hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies,
    and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures.
    These factors, in turn, could result in reduced demand for our
    products and increased downward pricing pressure. It is also
    possible that the PPACA will result in lower reimbursements for
    our products. While the PPACA is intended to expand health
    insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States,
    the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on
    sales of BD’s products remains uncertain.

Efforts
    to reduce the U.S. federal deficit could adversely affect our
    results of operations.

As part of the law passed in August 2011 to extend the federal
    debt limit and reduce government spending, a bipartisan
    committee was established to identify up to $1.5 trillion in
    cuts to federal programs. On November 21, 2011, the joint
    committee announced that it would not reach an agreement by the
    prescribed deadline, which will trigger an automatic $1.2
    trillion in additional spending cuts in the absence of further
    legislative action. Half of the automatic reductions would come
    from lowering the caps imposed on domestic discretionary
    spending and cutting domestic entitlement programs, including
    reductions in payments to Medicare providers. Government
    research funding could also be impacted as part of any deficit
    reduction. Any such reductions in government healthcare spending
    or research funding could result in reduced demand for our
    products or additional pricing pressure.

Price
    volatility could adversely affect costs associated with our
    operations.

Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price
    volatility in the cost of raw materials, components, freight and
    energy. In particular, BD purchases supplies of resins, which
    are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain
    products. Any significant increases in resin purchase costs
    could impact future operating results. Increases in the price of
    oil can also increase BD’s costs for packaging and
    transportation. New laws or regulations adopted in response to
    climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of
    certain raw materials and components. These cost increases may
    adversely affect our profitability.

BD’s
    future growth is dependent upon the development of new products,
    and there can be no assurance that such products will be
    developed.

A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue
    growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to
    patients, healthcare workers and researchers. The development of
    these products requires significant research and development,
    clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our
    product development efforts may be affected by a number of
    factors, including BD’s ability to innovate, develop and
    manufacture new products, complete clinical trials, obtain
    regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and
    abroad, or gain and maintain market approval of our products. In
    addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our
    commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that
    any products now in development or that we may seek to develop
    in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain
    regulatory approval, or gain market acceptance.



We cannot
    guarantee that any of BD’s strategic acquisitions,
    investments or alliances will be successful.

As part of our strategy to increase revenue growth, we seek to
    supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions,
    investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently
    risky. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance
    may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to
    properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or
    to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our
    existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or
    future transaction will be successful.

The
    medical technology industry is very competitive.

The medical technology industry is subject to rapid
    technological changes, and we face significant competition
    across our product lines and in each market in which our
    products are sold. We face this competition from a wide range of
    companies. These include large medical device companies, some of
    which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we
    do. We also face competition from firms that are more
    specialized than we are with respect to particular markets.
    Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology
    products have become manufacturers of medical devices and
    instruments as well. In some instances, competitors, including
    pharmaceutical companies, also offer, or are attempting to
    develop, alternative therapies for disease states that may be
    delivered without a medical device. The development of new or
    improved products, processes or technologies by other companies
    (such as needle-free injection technology) may render our
    products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In
    addition, increasing customer demand for more
    environmentally-friendly products is creating another basis on
    which BD must compete. The entry into the market of
    manufacturers located in China and other low-cost manufacturing
    locations is also creating pricing pressure, particularly in
    developing markets. Some competitors have also established
    manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in
    these countries as a means to lower their costs. New entrants
    may also appear, particularly from these low-cost countries.

Consolidation
    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect BD’s
    future revenues and operating income.

The medical technology industry has experienced a significant
    amount of consolidation. As a result of this consolidation,
    competition to provide goods and services to customers has
    increased. In addition, group purchasing organizations and
    integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate
    purchasing decisions for some customers, which has also placed
    pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. Further
    consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on
    the prices of our products.

The
    international operations of BD’s business may subject BD to
    certain business risks.

BD operations outside the United States subject BD to certain
    risks, including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange (discussed above); the effects of local economic
    conditions; changes in foreign regulatory requirements; local
    product preferences; difficulty in establishing, staffing and
    managing foreign operations; differing labor regulations;
    changes in tax laws; potential political instability; trade
    barriers; weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual
    property rights in some countries; and restrictions on the
    transfer of capital across borders. The success of our
    operations outside the United States will depend, in part, on
    our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local
    companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to,
    among other things, our production facilities and distribution
    networks.

Reductions
    in customers’ research budgets or government funding may
    adversely affect our BD Biosciences segment.

Our BD Biosciences segment sells products to researchers at
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic
    institutions, government laboratories and private foundations.
    Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate
    based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. A
    number of these customers are also dependent for their funding
    upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the
    U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and
    agencies in other countries. The level of government funding of
    research and development is unpredictable. There have been
    instances where NIH



grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended
    periods. The availability of governmental research funding may
    also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic
    downturn. Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could
    cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products.

A
    reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials
    and components would adversely affect BD’s manufacturing
    operations and related product sales.

BD purchases many different types of raw materials and
    components. Certain raw materials (primarily related to the BD
    Biosciences segment) and components are not available from
    multiple sources. In addition, for quality assurance,
    cost-effectiveness and other reasons, BD elects to purchase
    certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers. The
    supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of
    reasons, including current economic conditions as described
    above. While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of
    supply, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be
    successful. In addition, where there are regulatory requirements
    relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able
    to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely
    basis. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of
    these sole-sourced raw materials and components could impact our
    ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.

Interruption
    of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect BD’s
    future revenues and operating income.

We have manufacturing sites all over the world. In addition, in
    some instances, the manufacturing of certain of our product
    lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. As a result,
    weather, natural disasters (including pandemics), terrorism,
    political change, failure to follow specific internal protocols
    and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or
    damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect
    our ability to manufacture our products.

BD is
    subject to a number of pending lawsuits.

BD is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits, including
    purported class action lawsuits for, among other things, alleged
    antitrust violations and patent infringement, and could be
    subject to additional lawsuits in the future. A more detailed
    description of these lawsuits is contained in Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally,
    we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of
    loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the
    litigation to which we are a party. In view of these
    uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently
    established accruals and, to the extent available, excess
    liability insurance. Any such future charges, individually or in
    the aggregate, could adversely affect BD’s results of
    operations and cash flows.

BD is
    subject to extensive regulation.

BD is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the
    Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in
    foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and
    governing bodies. Most of BD’s products must receive
    clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart regulatory
    agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold.
    The process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may
    take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of
    substantial resources, and these have been increasing due to
    increased requirements from the FDA for supporting data for
    submissions. The process may also require changes to our
    products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the
    products. Also, governmental agencies may impose new
    requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited
    materials that may require us to modify or re-register products
    already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market
    our products in those countries. Once clearance or approval has
    been obtained for a product, there is an obligation to ensure
    that all applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements
    continue to be met.

Following the introduction of a product, these agencies also
    periodically review our manufacturing processes and product
    performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable good
    manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, clinical trial
    and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent
    the



production, marketing or sale of our products and result in
    fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, closure
    of manufacturing sites, seizures or recalls of products and
    damage to our reputation. Recent changes in enforcement practice
    by the FDA and other agencies have resulted in increased
    enforcement activity, which increases the compliance risk for BD
    and other companies in our industry.

Product
    defects could adversely affect the results of our
    operations.

The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve
    certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects,
    unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of
    risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or
    other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or
    safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or
    required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other
    countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal
    of a product from the market. A recall could result in
    significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to
    our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.
    Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also
    result in product liability claims being brought against us. In
    some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays
    in new product approvals.

We may
    experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource
    planning system.

We are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource
    planning (“ERP”) system. Our ERP system is critical to
    our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record
    transactions, provide important information to our management
    and prepare our financial statements. The design and
    implementation of the new ERP system has required, and will
    continue to require, the investment of significant financial and
    human resources. The total cost needed to implement the new ERP
    system may turn out to be more than we currently anticipate. In
    addition, we may not be able to successfully implement the new
    ERP system without experiencing difficulties. Any disruptions,
    delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the
    new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process
    orders, ship products, provide services and customer support,
    send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual
    obligations or otherwise operate our business.

Our
    operations are dependent in part on patents and other
    intellectual property assets.

Many of BD’s businesses rely on patent, trademark and other
    intellectual property assets. While we do not believe that the
    loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset
    would materially adversely affect BD operations, these
    intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material
    importance to our business. BD can lose the protection afforded
    by these intellectual property assets through patent
    expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Patents
    attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products
    expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. The
    loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual
    property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings,
    financial condition or cash flows. In addition, competitors may
    claim that BD products infringe upon their intellectual
    property. Resolving any intellectual property claim can be
    costly and time-consuming.

Natural
    disasters, war and other events could adversely affect BD’s
    future revenues and operating income.

Natural disasters (including pandemics), war, terrorism, labor
    disruptions and international conflicts, and actions taken by
    the United States and other governments, or by our customers or
    suppliers, in response to such events, could cause significant
    economic disruption and political and social instability in the
    United States and in areas outside of the United States in which
    we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for
    our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and
    distribution capabilities, or increase the costs for or cause
    interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers.



We need
    to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.

Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to
    attract and retain executives and other key employees, including
    people in technical, marketing, sales and research positions.
    Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons
    with specialized skills, can be intense. BD’s ability to
    recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors,
    including compensation and benefits, work location and work
    environment. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain
    qualified executives and employees, our business could be
    adversely affected.

Properties.

BD’s executive offices are located in Franklin Lakes, New
    Jersey. As of November 1, 2011, BD owned and leased 180
    facilities throughout the world comprising approximately
    17,081,296 square feet of manufacturing, warehousing,
    administrative and research facilities. The
    U.S. facilities, including Puerto Rico, comprise
    approximately 7,018,934 square feet of owned and
    2,416,594 square feet of leased space. The international
    facilities comprise approximately 6,197,567 square feet of
    owned and 1,448,201 square feet of leased space. Sales
    offices and distribution centers included in the total square
    footage are also located throughout the world.

Operations in each of BD’s business segments are conducted
    at both U.S. and international locations. Particularly in
    the international marketplace, facilities often serve more than
    one business segment and are used for multiple purposes, such as
    administrative/sales, manufacturing

and/or

warehousing/distribution. BD generally seeks to own its
    manufacturing facilities, although some are leased. The

U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York

March 28, 2007

The plaintiffs in each of the above antitrust class action
    lawsuits seek monetary damages. All of the antitrust class
    action lawsuits have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in
    a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in Federal court in New
    Jersey.

On April 27, 2009, BD entered into a settlement agreement
    with the Distributor Plaintiffs in these actions. The settlement
    agreement provided for, among other things, the payment by BD of
    $45 million in exchange for a release by all potential
    class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal
    antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in
    the complaint, and a dismissal of the case with prejudice,
    insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims. The release
    would not cover potential class members that affirmatively opt
    out of the settlement. On September 30, 2010, the court
    issued an order denying a motion to approve the settlement
    agreement, ruling that the Hospital Plaintiffs, and not the
    Distributor Plaintiffs, are the direct purchasers entitled to
    pursue damages under the federal antitrust laws for certain
    sales of BD products. The settlement agreement currently remains
    in effect, subject to certain termination provisions, and the
    federal court of appeals has granted the Distributor
    Plaintiffs’ request to appeal the trial court’s order
    on an interlocutory basis. BD currently cannot estimate the
    range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these class
    action matters beyond the $45 million already accrued and
    changes to the amount already recognized may be required in the
    future as additional information becomes available.



In June 2007, Retractable Technologies, Inc. (“RTI”)
    filed a complaint against BD under the caption Retractable
    Technologies, Inc. vs. Becton Dickinson and Company (Civil
    Action

No. 2:07-cv-250,

U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas). RTI
    alleges that the BD
    Integra

tm

syringes infringe patents licensed exclusively to RTI. In its
    complaint, RTI also alleges that BD engaged in false advertising
    with respect to certain of BD’s safety-engineered products
    in violation of the Lanham Act; acted to exclude RTI from
    various product markets and to maintain its market share
    through, among other things, exclusionary contracts in violation
    of state and federal antitrust laws; and engaged in unfair
    competition. In January 2008, the court severed the patent and
    non-patent claims into separate cases, and stayed the non-patent
    claims during the pendency of the patent claims at the trial
    court level. RTI seeks money damages and injunctive relief. On
    April 1, 2008, RTI filed a complaint against BD under the
    caption Retractable Technologies, Inc. and Thomas J.
    Shaw v. Becton Dickinson and Company (Civil Action

No. 2:08-cv-141,

U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas). RTI
    alleges that the
    BD Integra

tm

syringes infringe another patent licensed exclusively to RTI.
    RTI seeks money damages and injunctive relief. On
    August 29, 2008, the court ordered the consolidation of the
    patent cases. On November 9, 2009, at a trial of these
    consolidated cases, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of RTI
    on all but one of its infringement claims, but did not find any
    willful infringement, and awarded RTI $5 million in
    damages. On May 19, 2010, the court granted RTI’s
    motion for a permanent injunction against the continued sale by
    BD of its BD
    Integra

tm

products in their current form, but stayed the injunction for
    the duration of BD’s appeal. At the same time, the court
    lifted a stay of RTI’s non-patent claims. On July 8,
    2011, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the
    District Court judgment that BD’s 3ml
    Integra

tm

products infringed the asserted RTI patents and affirmed the
    District Court judgment of infringement against BD’s
    discontinued 1ml
    Integra

tm

products. On October 31, 2011, the Federal Circuit Court of
    Appeals denied RTI’s request for an en banc rehearing. The
    trial on RTI’s antitrust and false advertising claims is
    scheduled to begin in February 2012. With respect to RTI’s
    antitrust and false advertising claims, BD cannot estimate the
    possible loss or range of possible loss as there are significant
    legal and factual issues to be resolved. In the event that RTI
    succeeds at trial and subsequent appeals, however, any potential
    loss could be material as RTI will likely seek to recover
    substantial damages including disgorgement of profits and
    damages under the federal antitrust laws which are trebled. BD
    believes RTI’s allegations are without merit.

On October 19, 2009, Gen-Probe Incorporated
    (“Gen-Probe”) filed a patent infringement action
    against BD in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of California. The complaint alleges that the BD
    Viper

tm

and BD
    Viper

tm

XTR

tm

systems and BD
    ProbeTec

tm

specimen collection products infringe certain U.S. patents
    of Gen-Probe. On March 23, 2010, Gen-Probe filed a
    complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of California, alleging that the BD
    Max

tm

instrument infringes Gen-Probe patents. The patents alleged to
    be infringed are a subset of the Gen-Probe patents asserted
    against BD in the October 2009 suit. On June 8, 2010, the
    Court consolidated these cases. Gen-Probe is seeking monetary
    damages and injunctive relief. BD currently cannot estimate the
    range of reasonably possible losses for this matter as the
    proceedings are in relatively early stages and there are
    significant issues to be resolved.

BD believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the
    above-mentioned suits pending against BD and is engaged in a
    vigorous defense of each of these matters.

BD is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other
    legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course
    of business.

BD is a party to a number of Federal proceedings in the United
    States brought under the Comprehensive Environment Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act, also known as
    “Superfund,” and similar state laws. The affected
    sites are in varying stages of development. In some instances,
    the remedy has been completed, while in others, environmental
    studies are commencing. For all sites, there are other
    potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally
    liable to pay all cleanup costs.

Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, BD is not
    able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that
    could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to
    which BD is a party. In accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles, BD establishes accruals to the
    extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of
    environmental matters, without considering possible third-party
    recoveries). In view of the uncertainties discussed below, BD
    could incur charges in excess of any currently



established accruals and, to the extent available, excess
    liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such
    future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a
    material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of
    operations and consolidated cash flows.

Management’s

    Operations.

FINANCIAL
    REVIEW

Company
    Overview

Description
    of the Company and Business Segments

Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) is a global
    medical technology company engaged principally in the
    development, manufacture and sale of medical devices, instrument
    systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions, life
    science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical
    industry and the general public. Our business consists of three
    worldwide business segments — BD Medical
    (“Medical”), BD Diagnostics (“Diagnostics”)
    and BD Biosciences (“Biosciences”). Our products are
    marketed in the United States and internationally through
    independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by
    BD and independent sales representatives. References to years
    throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years, which end
    on September 30.

Strategic
    Objectives

BD remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and
    shareholder value, while making appropriate investments for the
    future. BD management operates the business consistent with the
    following core strategies:

•

To increase revenue growth by focusing on our core products that
    deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and
    researchers;

•

To increase investment in research and development for platform
    extensions and innovative new products;

•

To make significant investments in growing our emerging markets;

•

To improve operating effectiveness and balance sheet
    productivity;

•

To drive an efficient capital structure and strong shareholder
    returns.

Our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare
    and life sciences:

•

Enabling safer, simpler and more effective parenteral drug
    delivery;

•

Improving clinical outcomes through new, accurate and faster
    diagnostics;

•

Providing tools and technologies to the research community that
    facilitates the understanding of the cell, cellular diagnostics
    and cell therapy;

•

Enhancing disease management in diabetes, women’s health
    and cancer, and infection control.

We continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital
    structure and follow these guiding principles:

•

To maintain a solid investment grade rating;

•

To ensure access to the debt market for strategic opportunities;

•

To optimize the cost of capital based on market conditions.

In assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as
    BD’s financial condition and operating performance,
    management generally reviews quarterly forecast data, monthly
    actual results, segment sales and other similar information. We
    also consider trends related to certain key financial data,
    including gross profit margin, selling and administrative
    expense, investment in research and development, return on
    invested capital, and cash flows.



Financial
    Results

Worldwide revenues in 2011 of $7.8 billion increased 6%
    from the prior year and reflected volume increases of
    approximately 4%, estimated favorable foreign exchange
    translation of 3%, and estimated price decreases of just under
    1%, reflecting an ongoing downward trend. Worldwide revenue
    growth was also negatively impacted by about 2 percentage
    points due to an unfavorable comparison to 2010, which included
    strong sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic, supplemental
    government spending in Japan and economic stimulus research
    spending in the U.S. We experienced strong international
    sales of safety-engineered products and strong growth in
    emerging markets, which was offset, in part, by weaker demand in
    Western Europe resulting from austerity measures and lower
    healthcare utilization. Sales in the United States of
    safety-engineered devices grew 1% to $1.12 billion in 2011
    from $1.11 billion in 2010. International sales of
    safety-engineered devices grew 21% to $755 million in 2011
    from $622 million in 2010, which included an estimated 8%
    of favorable foreign currency translation. International
    safety-engineered device revenue growth continues to be driven
    by strong growth in the Medical Segment, with the largest growth
    in emerging markets, including China and Latin America.

The healthcare industry is facing a challenging economic
    environment. The current economic conditions and other
    circumstances have resulted in pricing pressures for some of our
    products, and we expect this downward pricing trend to continue
    through fiscal year 2012. In addition, healthcare utilization in
    the U.S. and Western Europe remains constrained due to
    decreases in government and private healthcare spending,
    resulting in less demand for our products, and we also expect
    these conditions to continue into fiscal 2012. We are also
    experiencing increased raw material costs. Our anticipated
    revenue growth over the next three years is expected to come
    from business growth and expansion among all segments and
    regions of the world, and the development in each business
    segment of new products and services that provide increased
    benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers. Our
    ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number
    of factors, including our ability to expand our core business
    (including geographical expansion), develop innovative new
    products with higher gross profit margins across our business
    segments, and continue to improve operating efficiency and
    organizational effectiveness. In addition to the economic
    conditions in the United States and elsewhere, numerous other
    factors can affect our ability to achieve these goals including,
    without limitation, increased competition and healthcare reform
    initiatives. For example, the U.S. healthcare reform law
    contains certain tax provisions that will affect BD. The most
    significant impact is the medical device excise tax, which
    imposes a 2.3% tax on certain U.S. sales of medical
    devices, beginning in January 2013. Sales of BD products that we
    estimate to be subject to this tax represented about 80% of
    BD’s total U.S. revenues in fiscal year 2011.

Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from
    operating activities totaling $1.7 billion in 2011. At
    September 30, 2011, we had $1.6 billion in cash and
    equivalents and short-term investments. In 2011, cash outflows
    relating to acquisitions included the purchase of Carmel Pharma
    AB (“Carmel Pharma”), a Swedish company that
    manufactures the BD
    PhaSeal

®

System, a closed-system drug transfer device for the safe
    handling of hazardous drugs that are packaged in vials, for
    $287 million, net of cash acquired. Cash outflows in 2011
    also reflected the acquisition of Accuri Cytometers, Inc.
    (“Accuri”) a company that develops and manufactures
    personal flow cytometers for researchers, for $205 million,
    net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures were
    $515 million in 2011 as we continue to invest in capacity
    across our segments to support future growth. BD’s strong
    cash flow generation also provided the flexibility to continue
    to return value to our shareholders in the form of share
    repurchases and dividends. During 2011, we repurchased
    18.4 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion
    and paid cash dividends to our shareholders totaling
    $361 million. In November 2011, we issued $500 million
    of

5-year

1.75% Notes and $1 billion of

10-year

3.125% Notes, as discussed further below.

We face currency exposure each reporting period that arises from
    translating the results of our worldwide operations to the
    U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the
    beginning of such period. From time to time, we purchase forward
    contracts and options to partially protect against adverse
    foreign exchange rate movements. Gains or losses on our
    derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses
    on the underlying hedged transactions. We do not enter into
    derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We
    did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows in fiscal year
    2011 or 2012. The favorable impact of



foreign currency on revenues for 2011 reflected favorable
    foreign currency translation and a favorable comparison
    resulting from hedge losses recognized in 2010. For further
    discussion refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial
    statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data.

Results
    of Continuing Operations

Comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2011
    and 2010 are affected by the following items that are reflected
    in our financial results:

•

During the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a non-cash
    pre-tax charge of $9 million, or $0.03 diluted earnings per
    share from continuing operations, resulting from the
    discontinuance of a research program within the Diagnostic
    Systems unit.

•

During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded a non-cash charge
    of $9 million, or $0.04 diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations, related to the elimination of the
    employer deduction of the Medicare Part D retiree drug
    subsidy under the U.S. healthcare reform law.

In addition, our 2011 results were unfavorably impacted by the
    effects of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that occurred
    earlier in the year. For the total fiscal year 2011, these
    events had an estimated unfavorable impact of about
    $15 million on revenues, and approximately $0.05 diluted
    earnings per share from continuing operations.

Medical
    Segment

Medical revenues in 2011 of $4.0 billion increased
    $211 million, or 5.6%, over 2010, which reflected an
    estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of
    3.3%.

Revenue growth in the Medical Segment reflected strong growth of
    Pharmaceutical Systems and international safety-engineered
    product sales. Revenues of safety-engineered products increased
    33.4% internationally, which included an estimated favorable
    foreign exchange impact of 9.7%. Revenue growth in the
    Pharmaceutical Systems unit was driven by double-digit growth in
    the United States, Japan and Latin America. U.S. revenue
    growth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit in 2011 was aided by
    strong sales to companies producing certain generic heparin
    products. Revenue growth in the Diabetes Care unit resulted
    primarily from continued strong growth in worldwide pen needle
    sales. Medical revenues in 2011 also reflected an unfavorable
    comparison to the prior-year period that included strong sales
    related to the H1N1 flu pandemic primarily in the first half of
    the year. We estimate that this unfavorable comparison
    negatively impacted Medical’s revenue growth rate by
    approximately 2.2 percentage points.

Medical operating income in 2011 was $1.2 billion, or 29.5%
    of Medical revenues, as compared with $1.1 billion, or
    29.5%, of revenues in 2010. Gross profit margin was higher in
    the current year than 2010 due to increased sales of products
    with relatively high gross margins as well as continued
    manufacturing productivity and lower manufacturing

start-up

costs. These favorable impacts on gross profit margin were
    partially offset by increases in certain raw material costs and
    higher pension costs allocated to the Segment. See further
    discussion on gross profit margin below. Selling and
    administrative expense as a percentage of



Medical revenues in 2011 increased to 17.5% of revenues from
    17.3% of revenues in 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of
    Carmel Pharma and unfavorable foreign currency translation,
    partially offset by continued spending controls. Research and
    development expenses in 2011 increased $17 million, or 13%,
    and reflected continued investment in the development of new
    products and platforms, including new infusion therapy products
    and new pen needle introductions.

Diagnostics
    Segment

Diagnostics revenues in 2011 of $2.5 billion increased
    $161 million, or 7.0%, over 2010, which reflected an
    estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of
    3.1%.

Revenue growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit was driven by
    sales of safety-engineered products. Sales of safety-engineered
    products grew 3% in the United States, driven by BD
    Vacutainer

tm

Push Button Blood Collection Set sales, and 15% internationally,
    which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of
    7%. The Diagnostic Systems unit experienced growth in worldwide
    sales of its automated diagnostic platforms, including the
    molecular BD
    ProbeTec

tm

,

    BD
    Viper

tm

and BD
    Affirm

systems, along with solid growth of its BD
    BACTEC

tm

blood culture and TB systems and the BD
    Phoenix

tm

ID/AST platform and its healthcare-associated infections
    (“HAI”) product offerings. Diagnostics revenues in
    2011 also reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prior-year
    period that included strong sales related to the flu pandemic in
    2010. We estimate that this unfavorable comparison negatively
    impacted Diagnostics’ revenue growth rate by approximately
    0.6 percentage points.

Diagnostics operating income in 2011 was $636 million, or
    25.7% of Diagnostics revenues, compared with $607 million,
    or 26.2% of revenues, in 2010. Gross profit margin in the
    Diagnostics segment was relatively flat as compared to the prior
    year and reflected favorable foreign currency translation,
    offset by higher raw material costs, primarily resin. See
    further discussion on gross profit margin below. Selling and
    administrative expense as a percentage of Diagnostics revenues
    increased by 30 basis points in 2011 to 21.5%, primarily
    due to investments in emerging markets and unfavorable foreign
    currency translation, partially offset by continued spending
    controls. Research and development expense increased
    $13 million, or 9% over 2010 and reflected continued
    investment in the development of new products and platforms,
    including the BD
    MAX

tm

and new BD
    Viper

tm

platforms and menus.

Biosciences
    Segment

Biosciences revenues in 2011 of $1.3 billion increased
    $84 million, or 6.7%, over 2010, which reflected an
    estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of
    3.5%.

Biosciences revenue growth was primarily driven by instrument
    and reagent sales in the Cell Analysis unit. The segment’s
    overall revenue growth was affected by slower growth in sales of
    Discovery Labware products in the U.S. Revenue growth in
    2011 was also negatively impacted by approximately
    3.6 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to
    2010, which included strong sales from U.S. stimulus
    spending and supplemental spending in Japan.

Biosciences operating income in 2011 was $376 million, or
    28.1% of Biosciences revenues, compared with $354 million,
    or 28.2%, in 2010. The Segment’s operating income in 2011
    reflected a higher gross profit margin than 2010 primarily due
    to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and
    higher margins on service revenue. These favorable variances
    from the prior year were partially offset by amortization of
    intangibles associated with the acquisition of Accuri and
    increases in certain raw material costs. See further discussion
    on gross profit margin below. Selling and administrative expense
    was 22.1% in 2011 as compared with 21.9% in 2010 and reflected
    unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by
    continued spending controls. Research and development spending
    increased $11 million or 12% and reflected spending on new
    products and platforms, including the BD FACS
    Verse

tm

Analyzer and other next generation cell sorters and analyzers.

Geographic
    Revenues

Revenues in the United States in 2011 of $3.4 billion
    increased 2%. U.S. revenue growth was negatively impacted
    by approximately 2.4 percentage points due to an
    unfavorable comparison to 2010, which included strong sales
    related to the flu pandemic and stimulus spending. The Medical
    segment experienced strong sales of Pharmaceutical Systems
    products in the U.S. Diagnostics revenue growth was driven
    by solid growth in infectious disease and molecular diagnostic
    platforms. Revenue growth in the Biosciences segment was driven
    by the Cell Analysis unit, partially offset by lower sales
    growth of Discovery Labware products.

International revenues in 2011 of $4.5 billion increased
    9.5%, which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign
    currency translation of 5.9%. Overall, international growth was
    driven by sales in emerging markets, with especially strong
    performance in Asia Pacific and Latin America, which was
    partially offset by slower growth in Western Europe.
    International revenue growth was negatively impacted by about
    1.5 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to
    2010, which included strong sales related to the H1N1 flu
    pandemic and supplemental spending in Japan. Revenue growth in
    the Medical Segment was driven by strong sales of
    safety-engineered products. Diagnostic revenue growth reflected
    solid growth of Women’s Health and Cancer products within
    the Diagnostic Systems unit, as governments are expanding
    programs for cervical cancer screening in developing markets.
    Biosciences revenue growth was driven by the Cell Analysis
    unit’s instrument and reagent sales, primarily in emerging
    markets.

Gross
    Profit Margin

Gross profit margin was 52.3% in 2011, compared with 51.9% in
    2010. Gross profit margin in 2011 reflected estimated favorable
    impacts of 20 basis points relating to foreign currency
    translation and 30 basis points relating to operating
    performance. The favorable impact from operating performance
    resulted from increased sales of products with relatively higher
    gross margins, increased productivity and lower manufacturing

start-up

costs, which were partially offset by increases in resin and
    other raw material costs and higher



pension costs. Gross profit margin in 2011 was also unfavorably
    impacted by 10 basis points as a result of the amortization
    of intangibles associated with the Accuri acquisition.

Operating
    Expenses

Selling and administrative expense in 2011 of $1.9 billion,
    or 23.7% of revenues, increased $130 million, or 8%,
    compared with $1.7 billion, or 23.3% of revenues, in 2010.
    Aggregate expenses reflected $46 million of unfavorable
    foreign exchange and increases in core spending of
    $53 million, reflecting funding to expand our business in
    emerging markets and higher shipping costs. Aggregate expenses
    also reflected a $6 million charge to bad debt expense
    related to European receivables, increased pension costs of
    $13 million and higher acquisition-related expenses of
    $6 million. Aggregate expenses for the year also included
    increased spending of $14 million related to our global
    enterprise resource planning initiative to update our business
    information systems. These increases were partially offset by a
    $7 million decrease in the deferred compensation plan
    liability, as further discussed below.

Research and development (“R&D”) expense in 2011
    was $476 million, or 6.1% of revenues, compared with
    $431 million, or 5.8% of revenues, in 2010. The increase in
    R&D expenditures includes spending for new products and
    platforms in each of our segments, as previously discussed.
    R&D expense also included a non-cash impairment charge of
    $9 million in 2011 resulting from the discontinuance of a
    research program within the Diagnostic Systems unit.

Non-Operating
    Expense and Income

Interest expense in 2011 was $84 million, compared with
    $51 million in 2010. This increase reflected higher levels
    of long-term fixed rate debt, partially offset by lower average
    interest rates on the overall long-term debt portfolio. Interest
    income was $43 million in 2011, compared with
    $35 million in 2010. This increase resulted from higher
    interest rates and levels of investments outside the United
    States, net of investment losses on assets related to our
    deferred compensation plan. The related decrease in the deferred
    compensation plan liability was recorded as a decrease in
    selling and administrative expenses.

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rate in 2011 of 26.3% was lower compared with
    the 2010 rate of 29.2% and reflected a favorable impact of
    1.3 percentage points due to certain tax benefits. These
    benefits resulted from the retroactive extension of the
    U.S. research tax credit as well as a European
    restructuring transaction. In addition, the 2010 rate was
    unfavorably impacted by 0.6 percentage points from the
    expiration of the R&D tax credit, and by
    0.5 percentage points from the non-cash charge related to
    healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements.

Income
    and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing
    Operations

Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share
    from continuing operations in 2011 were $1.3 billion and
    $5.59, respectively. The charge related to the discontinuance of
    a research program decreased income from continuing operations
    in 2011 by $9 million, or $0.03 per share. 2011 earnings
    also reflected an overall net favorable impact of foreign
    currency fluctuations of $0.28 per share. Income from continuing
    operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing
    operations in 2010 were $1.2 billion and $4.90,
    respectively. The charge related to healthcare reform decreased
    income from continuing operations in 2010 by $9 million, or
    $0.04 per share.

Financial
    Instrument Market Risk

We selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk,
    primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk
    relating to our ongoing business operations. The counterparties
    to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We
    do not enter into financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes.



Foreign
    Exchange Risk

BD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign
    currencies throughout Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, Japan and
    Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect
    of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables
    relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies
    other than our functional currency. These payables and
    receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We
    hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the
    use of forward contracts. We also face currency exposure that
    arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations,
    including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that
    have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. From
    time to time, we purchase forward contracts and options to hedge
    certain forecasted sales that are denominated in foreign
    currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in
    the value of future sales resulting from adverse foreign
    exchange rate movements. Gains or losses on our derivative
    instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the
    underlying hedged transactions.

Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance
    sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market
    risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an
    assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the
    U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon
    observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign
    currency prices for similar assets and liabilities. With respect
    to the derivative instruments outstanding at September 30,
    2011, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar over a one-year
    period would decrease pre-tax earnings by $23 million,
    while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would increase
    pre-tax earnings by $23 million. Comparatively, considering
    our derivative instruments outstanding at September 30,
    2010, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar over a one-year
    period would have decreased pre-tax earnings by
    $30 million, while a 10% depreciation of the
    U.S. dollar would have increased pre-tax earnings by
    $30 million. These calculations do not reflect the impact
    of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that
    would substantially offset the results of the derivative
    instruments.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in
    short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. Our debt and
    interest-bearing investments at September 30, 2011 are
    substantially all U.S. dollar-denominated. Therefore,
    transaction and translation exposure relating to such
    instruments is minimal. When managing interest rate exposures,
    we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and
    floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps
    to help maintain this balance and manage debt and
    interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have
    an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest
    rate derivative instruments, fair values are provided by the
    financial institutions that are counterparties to these
    arrangements. Market risk for these instruments is determined by
    calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in
    interest rates across all maturities. A change in interest rates
    on short-term debt and interest-bearing investments impacts our
    earnings and cash flow, but not the fair value of these
    instruments because of their limited duration. A change in
    interest rates on long-term debt is assumed to impact the fair
    value of the debt, but not our earnings or cash flow because the
    interest on such obligations is fixed. Based on our overall
    interest rate exposure at September 30, 2011 and 2010, a
    change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect
    on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period. An
    increase of 10% in interest rates would decrease the aggregate
    fair value of our long-term debt and related fair value hedges
    at September 30, 2011 and 2010 by approximately
    $90 million and $56 million, respectively. A 10%
    decrease in interest rates would increase the aggregate fair
    value of these same financial instruments at September 30,
    2011 and 2010 by approximately $96 million and
    $59 million, respectively.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Net
    Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2011 was
    $1.7 billion, unchanged from 2010. The change in operating
    assets and liabilities resulted from a net use of cash and
    primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and prepaid
    expenses. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities
    in 2010 was reduced



by discretionary cash contributions to the U.S. pension
    plan of $175 million. An additional discretionary cash
    contribution of $100 million was made to the
    U.S. pension plan in October 2011.

Net
    Cash Flows from Continuing Investing Activities

Capital
    Expenditures

Our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects
    that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities
    and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select
    investments in growing markets. Capital expenditures were
    $515 million in 2011, compared with $537 million in
    2010. Capital spending for the Medical, Diagnostics and
    Biosciences segments in 2011 was $367 million,
    $93 million and $37 million, respectively, and related
    primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions.

Acquisitions
    of Businesses

Cash outflows relating to acquisitions of $492 million in
    2011 were comprised of $287 million associated with the
    acquisition of Carmel Pharma and $205 million associated
    with the acquisition of Accuri. For further discussion, refer to
    Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained
    in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Net
    Cash Flows from Continuing Financing Activities

Debt
    Issuances and Payments of Obligations

On November 8, 2010, we issued $700 million of

10-year

3.25% Notes and $300 million of

30-year

5.00% Notes. Short-term debt decreased to 9% of total debt
    at the end of 2011, from 12% at the end of 2010. Floating rate
    debt was 16% of total debt at the end of 2011 and 24% at the end
    of 2010. Our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of
    2011 was 4.9%, up from 4.6% at the end of 2010.

Debt-to-capitalization

(ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt,
    shareholders’ equity and net non-current deferred income
    tax liabilities) at September 30, 2011 was 35.8% compared
    with 23.7% at September 30, 2010.

On November 3, 2011, we issued $500 million of

5-year

1.75% Notes and $1 billion of

10-year

3.125% Notes. The net proceeds from these issuances are
    expected to be used for repurchases of our common stock and
    other general corporate purposes, which may include funding for
    working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions.

Repurchase
    of Common Stock

We repurchased approximately 18.4 million shares of our
    common stock for $1.5 billion in 2011 and 10.1 million
    shares for $750 million in 2010. In July 2011, our Board of
    Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional
    18 million of our common shares. When combined with the
    remaining shares under the September 2010 Board of
    Directors’ repurchase authorization, a total of
    approximately 28 million common shares remain available for
    purchase at September 30, 2011. We plan on share
    repurchases of $1.5 billion in 2012, subject to market
    conditions. Such repurchases are expected to be funded primarily
    by the newly-issued debt in November 2011, as discussed further
    above.

Cash
    and Short-term Investments

At September 30, 2011, total worldwide cash and short-term
    investments were $1.56 billion, of which $1.34 billion
    was held in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We
    regularly review the amount of cash and short-term investments
    held outside the United States and currently intend to use most
    of such amounts to fund our international operations and their
    growth initiatives. However, if these amounts were moved out of
    these jurisdictions or repatriated to the United States, there
    could be tax consequences.



Government
    Receivables

Accounts receivable balances include sales to government-owned
    or government-supported healthcare facilities. Because these
    customers are government-owned or supported, we could be
    impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or by defaults
    in these countries.

We continually evaluate all government receivables, particularly
    in Spain, Italy, and other parts of Western Europe, for
    potential collection risks associated with the availability of
    government funding and reimbursement practices. We believe the
    current reserves related to government receivables are adequate
    and this concentration of credit risk is not expected to have a
    material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity.

Credit
    Facilities

We have in place a commercial paper borrowing program that is
    available to meet our short-term financing needs, including
    working capital requirements. Borrowings outstanding under this
    program were $200 million at September 30, 2011. We
    maintain a $1 billion syndicated credit facility in order
    to provide backup support for our commercial paper program and
    for other general corporate purposes. This credit facility
    expires in December 2012 and includes a single financial
    covenant that requires BD to maintain an interest expense
    coverage ratio (ratio of earnings before income taxes,
    depreciation and amortization to interest expense) of not less
    than 5-to-1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal
    quarters. On the last eight measurement dates, this ratio had
    ranged from 19-to-1 to 29-to-1. There were no borrowings
    outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2011. In
    addition, we have informal lines of credit outside the United
    States.

Access
    to Capital and Credit Ratings

Our ability to generate cash flow from operations, issue debt,
    enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term
    capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the
    event there was a material decline in the demand for our
    products, deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit
    ratings, or other significantly unfavorable changes in
    conditions.

BD’s credit ratings at September 30, 2011 were as
    follows:

Standard & Poor’s

Moody’s

Ratings:

Senior Unsecured Debt

AA−

A2

Commercial Paper

A-1+

P-1

Outlook

Stable

Stable

Upon review of our plans for the November 2011 debt issuance,
    Standard & Poor’s lowered BD’s Senior
    Unsecured Debt rating to A+ and its Commercial Paper rating to

A-1,

while
    affirming a rating outlook for BD of “Stable”. At the
    same time, Moody’s affirmed its Senior Unsecured Debt
    rating of A2 and Commercial Paper rating of

P-1,

but
    lowered its rating outlook for BD to “Negative”.

While further deterioration in our credit ratings would increase
    the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under its
    existing credit arrangements, such a downgrade would not affect
    our ability to draw on these credit facilities, nor would it
    result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any
    outstanding debt. We believe that given our debt ratings, our
    conservative financial management policies, our ability to
    generate cash flow and the non-cyclical, geographically
    diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to
    additional short-term and long-term capital should the need
    arise.



Contractual
    Obligations

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and
    commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. The
    table below sets forth BD’s significant contractual

Results
    of Continuing Operations

Worldwide revenues in 2010 of $7.4 billion increased 5.5%
    from the prior year and reflected volume increases of
    approximately 6%, unfavorable foreign exchange translation of
    0.1%, inclusive of hedge losses, and price decreases of 0.4%.
    The increase is attributable to solid revenue growth in the
    Medical Segment, continued improvement in Biosciences sales and,
    to a lesser extent, growth in Diagnostics Segment revenues.

Comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2010
    and 2009 are affected by the following significant items that
    are reflected in our 2010 financial results:

•

During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded a non-cash charge
    of $9 million, or 4 cents diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations, related to healthcare reform impacting
    Medicare Part D reimbursements.

•

During the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a tax benefit of
    $20 million, or 8 cents diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations, relating to various tax settlements in
    multiple jurisdictions.

•

During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded a pre-tax charge
    of $45 million, or 11 cents diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations, associated with the pending settlement in
    certain antitrust class action litigation.

Medical
    Segment

Medical revenues in 2010 of $3.8 billion increased
    $239 million, or 6.7%, over 2009, which reflected an
    estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of
    0.5%, net of hedge losses.

Revenue growth in the Medical Surgical Systems unit continues to
    be driven by sales of safety-engineered products and prefilled
    flush syringes. Revenues of safety-engineered products increased
    5% in the United States and 15% internationally, which included
    an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of 3%, net of
    hedge losses. Revenue growth in the Diabetes Care unit resulted
    primarily from continued strong growth in worldwide pen needle
    sales and a co-marketing agreement in the United States. Revenue
    growth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit was driven by
    double-digit growth in the United States, Japan and Asia
    Pacific. Revenues related to the H1N1 pandemic grew
    $15 million to $45 million for the Medical Surgical
    Systems unit and grew $10 million to $35 million for
    the Pharmaceutical Systems unit in 2010.

Medical operating income in 2010 was $1.1 billion, or 29.5%
    of Medical revenues, as compared with $1.0 billion, or
    29.5%, of revenues in 2009. Favorable manufacturing productivity
    improvements were substantially offset by a slight decrease in
    gross profit margin resulting from unfavorable foreign currency
    translation, a modest increase in the cost of raw materials, and
    increased manufacturing

start-up

and
    restructuring costs. See further discussion on gross profit
    margin below. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage
    of Medical revenues in 2010 declined to 17.3% of revenues from
    17.5% of revenues in 2009, primarily due to continued diligent
    spending controls. Research and development expenses in 2010
    increased $8 million, or 7%, and reflected continued
    investment in the development of new products and platforms.

Diagnostics
    Segment

Diagnostics revenues in 2010 of $2.3 billion increased
    $93 million, or 4.2%, over 2009, which reflected an
    estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of
    0.2%, net of hedge losses.

    products grew 5% in the United States, driven by BD
    Vacutainer

tm

Push Button Blood Collection Set sales, and 7% internationally,
    which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of
    1%, net of hedge losses. The Diagnostic Systems unit experienced
    growth in worldwide sales of its automated diagnostic platforms,
    including the molecular BD

ID/AST platform. Revenues related to the flu pandemic were
    $13 million in 2010 compared with $22 million in 2009
    for the Diagnostic Systems unit.



Diagnostics operating income in 2010 was $607 million, or
    26.2% of Diagnostics revenues, compared with $607 million,
    or 27.3% of revenues, in 2009. The Diagnostics segment
    experienced a decline in gross profit margin that reflected
    unfavorable foreign currency translation and

start-up

costs associated with acquisitions. This decline was partially
    offset by sales growth of products that have higher overall
    gross profit margins, in particular, safety-engineered products
    and the BD
    ProbeTec

tm

and BD
    Viper

tm

systems. See further discussion on gross profit margin below.
    Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of
    Diagnostics revenues remained the same in 2010 at 21.2%, due to
    continued spending controls. Research and development expense
    increased modestly over 2009 and reflected continued investment
    in the development of new products and platforms with particular
    emphasis on our molecular platforms.

Biosciences
    Segment

Biosciences revenues in 2010 of $1.3 billion increased
    $53 million, or 4.4%, over 2009, which reflected an
    estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of
    2.4% due to hedge losses. Biosciences revenues reflected a
    larger portion of our hedge losses, which are allocated to the
    segments based on their proportionate share of international
    sales of

U.S.-produced

products.

    programs in the U.S. as well as supplemental funding in
    Japan. Revenue growth in the Discovery Labware unit reflected
    increased sales to major biopharmaceutical customers, offset by
    reduced private label sales compared with 2009.

Biosciences operating income in 2010 was $354 million, or
    28.2% of Biosciences revenues, compared with $362 million,
    or 30.1%, in 2009. The decrease in operating income, as a
    percentage of revenues, reflects lower gross profit from the
    unfavorable impact of hedge losses, partially offset by the
    favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Selling and
    administrative expense was 21.9% in 2010 as compared with 21.6%
    in 2009 and reflected new direct selling programs and
    inflationary factors. Research and development expense increased
    $10 million, or 11%, and reflected spending on new product
    development and advanced technology.

    increased 5%. Overall, growth was led by sales of
    safety-engineered products, which increased 5% to
    $1.11 billion from $1.06 billion in 2009, as well as
    sales of Diabetes Care products. Revenue growth also reflected
    sales of immunocytometry instruments and reagents, aided by
    stimulus programs in the U.S.

International revenues in 2010 of $4.1 billion increased
    6%, and reflected nominal impact from net foreign currency
    translation. Sales growth was led by double-digit growth in Asia
    Pacific, Latin America and Japan. International sales of
    safety-engineered devices grew 9.5% to $622 million in 2010
    from $568 million in 2009, which included an estimated
    impact of net favorable foreign currency translation of 1.4%.
    Sales growth in Western Europe was unfavorably impacted by
    continuing adverse macroeconomic conditions and an unfavorable
    comparison to 2009, which included flu-related sales that did
    not reoccur in 2010.



Gross
    Profit Margin

Gross profit margin was 51.9% in 2010, compared with 52.6% in
    2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 reflected an estimated
    unfavorable impact primarily from hedging activity of
    90 basis points. Partially offsetting these losses was a
    net favorable operating performance impact of 20 basis
    points. Operating performance reflected higher sales of products
    with higher gross margins, partially offset by higher
    manufacturing

start-up

and
    restructuring costs, higher pension costs, and increases in
    certain raw material costs.

Operating
    Expenses

Selling and administrative expense in 2010 of $1.7 billion,
    or 23.3% of revenues, increased $41 million, or 2%,
    compared with $1.7 billion, or 24.1% of revenues, in 2009.
    This increase reflected $32 million of unfavorable foreign
    currency translation. Increased spending in 2010 included
    $18 million in core spending, $16 million related to
    our global enterprise resource planning initiative to update our
    business information systems, and $15 million in pension
    costs. Aggregate expenses for 2009 reflected the
    $45 million litigation charge previously discussed.

Research and development (“R&D”) expense in 2010
    was $431 million, or 5.8% of revenues, compared with
    $405 million, or 5.8% of revenues, in 2009. The increase in
    R&D expenditures includes spending for new products and
    platforms in each of our segments, as previously discussed.

Non-Operating
    Expense and Income

Interest expense in 2010 was $51 million, compared with
    $40 million in 2009. This increase reflected higher levels
    of long-term fixed rate debt, partially offset by lower interest
    rates on floating rate debt and a benefit from higher levels of
    capitalized interest. Interest income was $35 million in
    2010, compared with $33 million in 2009. This increase
    resulted primarily from higher investment levels. Other income
    (expense), net in 2010 included the gain recognized on the sale
    of the extended dwell catheter product platform of
    $18 million and a write-down of investments of
    $14 million.

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rate in 2010 of 29.2% was higher compared with
    the 2009 rate of 26.1% and reflected the unfavorable impact of
    certain unusual items. The 2010 rate was unfavorably impacted by
    0.6 percentage points from the expiration of the R&D
    tax credit, and by 0.5 percentage points from the non-cash
    charge related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare
    Part D reimbursements. In addition, the 2009 rate reflected
    a 1.2 percentage point benefit due to various tax
    settlements in multiple jurisdictions.

Income
    and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing
    Operations

Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share
    from continuing operations in 2010 were $1.2 billion and
    $4.90, respectively. The non-cash charge related to healthcare
    reform decreased income from continuing operations and diluted
    earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 by
    $9 million, or 4 cents, respectively. The current
    year’s earnings also reflected an overall net unfavorable
    impact of foreign exchange fluctuations of 26 cents, including
    hedge losses. Income from continuing operations and diluted
    earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 were
    $1.2 million and $4.73, respectively. The tax benefit
    discussed above increased income from continuing operations and
    diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 by
    $20 million, or 8 cents, respectively. The litigation
    charge discussed above decreased income from continuing
    operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing
    operations in 2009 by $28 million, or 11 cents,
    respectively.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Net
    Cash Flows from Continuing Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2010 was
    $1.7 billion, unchanged from 2009. The change in operating
    assets and liabilities resulted from a net use of cash and
    reflected higher levels of accounts



receivable and inventory. Net cash provided by continuing
    operating activities was reduced by discretionary cash
    contributions to the U.S. pension plan of $175 million
    and $75 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Net
    Cash Flows from Continuing Investing
    Activities

Capital expenditures were $537 million in 2010, compared
    with $585 million in 2009. Capital spending for the
    Medical, Diagnostics and Biosciences segments in 2010 was
    $369 million, $109 million and $50 million,
    respectively, and related primarily to manufacturing capacity
    expansions.

Cash outflows relating to acquisitions of $281 million in
    2010 primarily related to a cash outflow of $275 million
    associated with the acquisition of HandyLab, Inc. For further
    discussion refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data.

On July 30, 2010, the Company sold the Ophthalmic Systems
    unit and the surgical blades platform. The sale of the critical
    care and extended dwell catheter product platforms was completed
    on September 30, 2010. Cash proceeds received in the fourth
    quarter 2010 from these divestitures were $260 million, net
    of working capital adjustments. For further discussion refer to
    Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained
    in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Net
    Cash Flows from Continuing Financing
    Activities

The change in short-term debt reflected the repayment of
    $200 million of 7.15% Notes, due October 1, 2009,
    using the proceeds from the issuance of $500 million of

10-year,

5.00% Notes and $250 million of

30-year,

6.00% Notes in May 2009. Short-term debt decreased to 12%
    of total debt at the end of 2010, from 21% at the end of 2009.
    Floating rate debt was 24% of total debt at the end of 2010 and
    32% at the end of 2009. Our weighted average cost of total debt
    at the end of 2010 was 4.6%, down from 4.9% at the end of 2009.

Debt-to-capitalization

(ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt,
    shareholders’ equity and net non-current deferred income
    tax liabilities) at September 30, 2010 was 23.7% compared
    to 26.8% at September 30, 2009.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
    requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect
    the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
    statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and
    complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from
    those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on
    historical experience and on various other factors that are
    believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
    of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. For any given estimate or assumption made by
    management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable
    judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop
    different estimates. Actual results that differ from
    management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on
    our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the
    following critical accounting policies reflect the more
    significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements:

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales is typically recognized when all of
    the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered; product price is fixed or determinable; and collection
    of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.

For certain instruments sold from the Biosciences segment, we
    recognize revenue upon installation at a customer’s site,
    as installation of these instruments is considered a significant
    post-delivery obligation. For certain sales arrangements,
    primarily in the U.S., with multiple deliverables, revenue and
    cost of products sold are recognized at the completion of each
    deliverable: shipment, installation and training. These sales
    agreements are divided into separate units of accounting and
    revenue is recognized upon the completion of



each deliverable based on its relative selling price. The
    relative selling prices of installation and training are
    determined based on the prices at which these deliverables would
    be regularly sold on a standalone basis. The relative selling
    prices of instruments are based on estimated selling prices.
    These estimates represent the quoted sales contract price in
    each arrangement.

BD’s domestic businesses sell products primarily to
    distributors who resell the products to end-user customers. We
    provide rebates to distributors that sell to end-user customers
    at prices determined under a contract between BD and the
    end-user customer. Provisions for rebates, which are based on
    historical information for all rebates that have not yet been
    processed, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted
    for as a reduction of revenues when revenue is recognized.

Impairment
    of Assets

Goodwill and in-process research and development assets are
    subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever
    indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite
    lives, including core and developed technology, and other
    long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when
    impairment indicators are present.

We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level,
    which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an
    operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting
    units generally represent one level below reporting segments and
    we aggregate components within an operating segment that have
    similar economic characteristics. For our 2011 annual impairment
    assessment, we identified six reporting units. Potential
    impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value
    of a reporting unit with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill
    impairment test for 2011 did not result in any impairment
    charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its
    carrying value.

We generally use the income approach to derive the fair value
    for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value
    by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and
    then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a
    risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we
    believe the income approach most appropriately measures our
    income producing assets. This approach requires significant
    management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and
    expense growth rates, changes in working capital use,
    appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates.
    The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BD’s
    business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions
    could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the
    asset, and potentially result in different impacts to BD’s
    results of operations. Actual results may differ from
    management’s estimates.

Income
    Taxes

BD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than
    not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be
    realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our
    tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a
    valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors
    such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry
    back and carry forward periods, and tax strategies that could
    potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred
    tax asset.

BD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries
    and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax
    jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with
    various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain
    tax positions based on the technical support for the positions,
    our past audit experience with similar situations, and the
    potential interest and penalties related to the matters.
    BD’s effective tax rate in any given period could be
    impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we
    prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established,
    or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established
    reserves.

Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. At
    September 30, 2011, the cumulative amount of such
    undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the
    United States was $3.8 billion. The determination of the
    amount of the unrecognized



deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is
    not practicable because of the complexities associated with its
    hypothetical calculation.

Contingencies

We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various
    legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business,
    including, without limitation, product liability, antitrust and
    environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 5 to
    the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8,
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We assess the
    likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters
    as well as potential ranges of probable losses. We establish
    accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in
    the case of environmental matters, without considering possible
    third-party recoveries). A determination of the amount of
    accruals, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful
    analysis of each individual issue and, when appropriate, is
    developed after consultation with outside counsel. The accruals
    may change in the future due to new developments in each matter
    or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters.

Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not
    able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that
    could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to
    which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could
    incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals
    and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance.
    Accordingly, in the opinion of management, any such future
    charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material
    adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations
    and consolidated net cash flows.

Benefit
    Plans

We have significant net pension and other postretirement benefit
    costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. Pension
    benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate and
    expected return on plan assets. Other postretirement benefit
    plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate and
    healthcare cost trend rates. These assumptions have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the
    analysis below, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial
    statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data for additional discussion.

The discount rate is selected each year based on investment
    grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date
    (September 30). For the U.S. pension plan, we will use a
    discount rate of 4.9% for 2012, which was based on an
    actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve. The rate
    selected is used to measure liabilities as of the measurement
    date and for calculating the following year’s pension
    expense. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently
    due to the long-term nature of the assumption. This assumption
    does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of
    the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation
    of pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of
    return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors,
    including our historical assumptions compared with actual
    results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset
    classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We
    will use a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets
    assumption of 7.75% for the U.S. pension plan in 2012. We
    believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return
    on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above
    factors.

Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our
    U.S. pension and other postretirement plans are as follows:

•

Discount rate —

A change of plus (minus)
    25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant,
    would have an estimated $8 million favorable (unfavorable)
    impact on the total U.S. net pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan cost.

•

Expected return on plan assets —

A change of
    plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held
    constant, would have an estimated $2 million favorable
    (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan cost.



Share-Based
    Compensation

Compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions
    is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement
    method. All share-based payments to employees, including grants
    of employee stock options, are recognized in the statement of
    operations as compensation expense (based on their fair values)
    over the vesting period of the awards. We determine the fair
    value of certain share-based awards using a lattice-based
    binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain
    assumptions, such as the risk-free interest rate, expected
    volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the
    options. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial
    statements contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data for additional discussion.

Cautionary
    Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

BD and its representatives may from time to time make certain
    forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both
    written and oral, including statements contained in filings with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, and our
    reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be
    identified by the use of words such as “plan,”
    “expect,” “believe,” “intend,”
    “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate”
    and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among
    other things, discussions of future operations and financial
    performance, as well as our strategy for growth, product
    development, regulatory approvals, market position and
    expenditures. All statements that address operating performance
    or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will
    occur in the future — including statements relating to
    volume growth, sales and earnings per share growth, cash flows
    or uses, and statements expressing views about future operating
    results — are forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of
    future events. The forward-looking statements are, and will be,
    based on management’s then-current views and assumptions
    regarding future events and operating performance, and speak
    only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if
    underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or
    uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially
    from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore
    cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking
    statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or
    revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are
    made, whether as a result of new information, future events and
    developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law
    or regulations.

The following are some important factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ from our expectations in any
    forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of
    these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

•

The current conditions in the global economy and financial
    markets, and the potential adverse effect on the cost of
    operating our business, the demand for our products and
    services, prices for our products and services due to increases
    in pricing pressure, or our ability to produce our products,
    including the impact on developing countries. Also, the increase
    in sovereign debt during the financial crisis as a result of
    governmental intervention in the world economy poses additional
    risks to the global financial system and economic recovery. We
    sell to government-owned or government-supported healthcare and
    research facilities, and any governmental austerity programs or
    other adverse change in the availability of government funding
    in these countries, particularly in Western Europe, could result
    in less demand for our products and additional pricing
    pressures, as well as create potential collection risks
    associated with such sales.

•

The consequences of the healthcare reform in the United States,
    which implemented an excise tax on U.S. sales of certain
    medical devices, and which could result in reduced demand for
    our products, increased pricing pressures or otherwise adversely
    affect BD’s business.

•

Future healthcare reform in the countries in which we do
    business may also involve changes in government pricing and
    reimbursement policies or other cost containment reforms.

•

Changes in domestic and foreign healthcare industry practices
    that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or
    increased pricing pressures, including the continued
    consolidation among



healthcare providers and trends toward managed care and
    healthcare cost containment (including changes in reimbursement
    practices by third party payors).

•

Our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets, which
    also depends on economic and political conditions and how well
    we are able to acquire or form strategic business alliances with
    local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements
    to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment
    and technology.

•

Regional, national and foreign economic factors, including
    inflation, deflation, and fluctuations in interest rates and, in
    particular, foreign currency exchange rates, and the potential
    effect on our revenues, expenses, margins and credit ratings.

•

New or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and
    foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices,
    including laws relating to trade, monetary and fiscal policies,
    taxation (including tax reforms that could adversely impact
    multinational corporations), sales practices, price controls and
    licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and
    products in the postmarketing phase. In particular, the
    U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements
    regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that
    may require us to re-register products already on the market or
    otherwise impact our ability to market our products.
    Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of
    greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout
    the world, which may increase our costs of operations or
    necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or
    those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD.

•

Product efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products
    resulting in product recalls, regulatory action on the part of
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or foreign
    counterparts, declining sales and product liability claims,
    particularly in light of the current regulatory environment,
    including increased enforcement activity by the FDA.

•

Competitive factors that could adversely affect our operations,
    including new product introductions (for example, new forms of
    drug delivery) by our current or future competitors, increased
    pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers as
    certain competitors have established manufacturing sites or have
    contracted with suppliers in low-cost manufacturing locations as
    a means to lower their costs, patents attained by competitors
    (particularly as patents on our products expire), and new
    entrants into our markets.

•

The effects of events that adversely impact our ability to
    manufacture our products (particularly where production of a
    product line is concentrated in one or more plants) or our
    ability to source materials or components from suppliers that
    are needed for such manufacturing, including pandemics, natural
    disasters, environmental factors or cyber attacks.

•

Fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins
    and other raw materials, as well as certain

sub-assemblies

and finished goods, the ability to maintain favorable supplier
    arrangements and relationships (particularly with respect to
    sole-source suppliers), and the potential adverse effects of any
    disruption in the availability of such items.

•

Difficulties inherent in product development, including the
    potential inability to successfully continue technological
    innovation, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory
    approvals in the United States and abroad, obtain coverage and
    adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain
    market approval of products, as well as the possibility of
    infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or
    other intellectual property rights, all of which can preclude or
    delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining
    necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other
    regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process
    (including potential 510(k) reforms) may also delay product
    launches and increase development costs.

•

Fluctuations in the demand for products we sell to
    pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are
    sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of
    funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.



•

Fluctuations in university or U.S. and international
    governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.

•

Our ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product
    sales. Our earnings forecasts are based on projected volumes and
    sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable
    than others.

•

Our ability to implement our ongoing upgrade of our enterprise
    resource planning system, as any delays or deficiencies in the
    design and implementation of our upgrade could adversely affect
    our business.

•

Pending and potential future litigation or other proceedings
    adverse to BD, including antitrust claims, product liability
    claims and patent infringement claims, and the availability or
    collectibility of insurance relating to any such claims.

•

The effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity
    regarding BD’s business or operations, including the effect
    on BD’s reputation or demand for its products.

•

The effects, if any, of governmental and media activities
    regarding the business practices of group purchasing
    organizations, which negotiate product prices on behalf of their
    member hospitals with BD and other suppliers.

•

The effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in
    BD’s pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset
    return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional
    contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.

•

Political conditions in international markets, including civil
    unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions
    on the ability to transfer capital across borders and
    expropriation of assets by a government, including the recent
    civil unrest in parts of the Middle East.

•

The impact of business combinations, including any volatility in
    earnings relating to acquired in-process research and
    development assets, and our ability to successfully integrate
    any business we may acquire.

•

Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring
    programs, if any, that we may undertake.

•

Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board or the Securities and Exchange
    Commission.

The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors
    that could impact our ability to achieve results described in
    any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that
    it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and
    should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all
    potential risks and uncertainties.

The following financial statements have been prepared by
    management in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles and include, where required, amounts based
    on the best estimates and judgments of management. The integrity
    and objectivity of data in the financial statements and
    elsewhere in this Annual Report are the responsibility of
    management.

In fulfilling its responsibilities for the integrity of the data
    presented and to safeguard the Company’s assets, management
    employs a system of internal accounting controls designed to
    provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that the
    Company’s assets are protected and that transactions are
    appropriately authorized, recorded and summarized. This system
    of control is supported by the selection of qualified personnel,
    by organizational assignments that provide appropriate
    delegation of authority and division of responsibilities, and by
    the dissemination of written policies and procedures. This
    control structure is further reinforced by a program of internal
    audits, including a policy that requires responsive action by
    management.

The Board of Directors monitors the internal control system,
    including internal accounting and financial reporting controls,
    through its Audit Committee, which consists of seven independent
    Directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the
    independent registered public accounting firm, the internal
    auditors and management to review the work of each and to
    satisfy itself that they are properly discharging their
    responsibilities. The independent registered public accounting
    firm and the internal auditors have full and free access to the
    Audit Committee and meet with its members, with and without
    management present, to discuss the scope and results of their
    audits including internal control, auditing and financial
    reporting matters.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Act of 1934. Management conducted an
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Based on this assessment and those criteria, management
    concluded that internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of September 30, 2011.

The financial statements and internal control over financial
    reporting have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst &
    Young’s reports with respect to fairness of the
    presentation of the statements, and the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, are included herein.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

Becton, Dickinson and Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Becton, Dickinson and Company as of September 30, 2011 and
    2010, and the related consolidated statements of income,
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended September 30, 2011. These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Becton, Dickinson and Company at
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended September 30, 2011, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Becton, Dickinson and Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated November 23, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

Becton, Dickinson and Company

We have audited Becton, Dickinson and Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Becton, Dickinson
    and Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Becton, Dickinson and Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Becton, Dickinson and Company as
    of September 30, 2011 and 2010, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    September 30, 2011 of Becton, Dickinson and Company, and
    our report dated November 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

Note 1 —

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Becton, Dickinson and Company and its majority-owned
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) after the elimination of
    intercompany transactions. The Company has no material interests
    in variable interest entities.

Cash
    Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with a
    maturity of three months or less at time of purchase.

Short-Term
    Investments

Short-term investments consist of time deposits with maturities
    greater than three months and less than one year when purchased.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of

first-in,

first-out cost or market.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less
    accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
    amortization are principally provided on the straight-line basis
    over estimated useful lives, which range from 20 to
    45 years for buildings, four to 12 years for machinery
    and equipment and one to 20 years for leasehold
    improvements. Depreciation and amortization expense was
    $348,522, $347,402 and $312,321 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill, core and developed technology, and in-process research
    and development assets arise from acquisitions. Goodwill is
    reviewed at least annually for impairment. Goodwill is assessed
    for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as
    an operating segment or one level below an operating segment,
    referred to as a component. The Company’s reporting units
    generally represent one level below reporting segments, and
    components within an operating segment that have similar
    economic characteristics are aggregated. Potential impairment of
    goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a
    reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its
    carrying value. The annual impairment review performed in fiscal
    year 2011 indicated that all six identified reporting
    units’ fair values exceeded their respective carrying
    values.

The review for impairment of in-process research and development
    assets, as well as core and developed technology assets,
    compares the fair value of the technology or project assets,
    estimated using an income approach, with their carrying value.
    In-process research and development assets are considered
    indefinite-lived assets until projects are completed or
    abandoned, and these assets are reviewed at least annually for
    impairment. Core and developed technology assets are amortized
    over periods ranging from 15 to 20 years, using the
    straight-line method, and are periodically reviewed for
    impairment when impairment indicators are present.

Other intangibles with finite useful lives, which include
    patents, are amortized over periods principally ranging from one
    to 40 years, using the straight-line method. These
    intangibles, including core and developed



Becton,
    Dickinson and Company

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

technology, are periodically reviewed when impairment indicators
    are present to assess recoverability from future operations
    using undiscounted cash flows. To the extent carrying value
    exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is
    recognized in operating results based upon the excess of the
    carrying value over fair value. Other intangibles also include
    certain trademarks that are considered to have indefinite lives,
    as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely, and
    are reviewed annually for impairment.

Capitalized
    Software

Capitalized software, including costs for software developed or
    obtained for internal use, is stated at cost, less accumulated
    amortization. Amortization expense is principally provided on
    the straight-line basis over estimated useful lives, which do
    not exceed 10 years. The current balance primarily includes
    capital software investments related to a global enterprise
    resource planning initiative to upgrade the Company’s
    business information systems. Amortization for this project has
    not commenced because the program has not yet been placed in
    service. Amortization expense related to capitalized software
    was $23,173, $32,181 and $46,485 for 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Generally, foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the
    local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign
    operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current
    exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from
    such translation, as well as exchange gains and losses on
    intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature, are
    included in the foreign currency translation adjustments in
    Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales is typically recognized when all of
    the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered; product price is fixed or determinable; collection of
    the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company
    recognizes revenue for certain instruments sold from the
    Biosciences segment upon installation at a customer’s site,
    as installation of these instruments is considered a significant
    post-delivery obligation. For certain instrument sales
    arrangements, primarily in the U.S., with multiple deliverables,
    revenue and cost of products sold are recognized at the
    completion of each deliverable: instrument shipment,
    installation and training. Installation and training typically
    occur within one month after an instrument is shipped. These
    sales agreements are divided into separate units of accounting
    and revenue is recognized upon the completion of each
    deliverable based on its relative selling price. The relative
    selling prices of installation and training are determined based
    on the prices at which these deliverables would be regularly
    sold on a standalone basis. The relative selling prices of
    instruments are based on estimated selling prices. These
    estimates represent the quoted sales contract price in each
    arrangement.

The Company’s domestic businesses sell products primarily
    to distributors that resell the products to end-user customers.
    Rebates are provided to distributors that sell to end-user
    customers at prices determined under a contract between the
    Company and the end-user customer. Provisions for rebates, as
    well as sales discounts and returns, are based upon estimates
    and are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when revenue is
    recognized.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in Selling and
    administrative expense. Shipping expense was $276,797, $255,765
    and $250,941 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

All derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value
    and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings
    unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

Derivative financial instruments are utilized by the Company in
    the management of its foreign currency and interest rate
    exposures. From time to time, the Company hedges forecasted
    sales denominated in foreign currencies using forward and option
    contracts to protect against the reduction in value of
    forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from export
    sales. The Company also periodically utilizes interest rate
    swaps to maintain a balance between fixed and floating rate
    instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative
    financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative
    instruments are recognized in income in the period in which the
    underlying hedged transaction is recognized. In the event a
    designated hedged item is sold, extinguished or matures prior to
    the termination of the related derivative instrument, such
    instrument would be closed and the resultant gain or loss would
    be recognized in income.

Income
    Taxes

United States income taxes are not provided on undistributed
    earnings of foreign subsidiaries where such undistributed
    earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.
    Deferred taxes are provided for earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    when those earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested.
    Income taxes are provided and tax credits are recognized based
    on tax laws enacted at the dates of the financial statements.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous
    countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number
    of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with
    various tax filing positions, the Company records accruals for
    uncertain tax positions, based on the technical support for the
    positions, past audit experience with similar situations, and
    the potential interest and penalties related to the matters.

The Company maintains valuation allowances where it is more
    likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset
    will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are
    included in the tax provision in the period of change. In
    determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted,
    management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history,
    expected future earnings, carry back and carry forward periods
    and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood
    of the realization of a deferred tax asset.

Earnings
    per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings
    per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if
    securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
    exercised or converted into common stock.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates or
    assumptions affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses as reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
    Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company recognizes the fair value of share-based
    compensation in net income. Compensation expense is recognized
    on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period,
    which is generally the vesting period.

Accounting
    Changes

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued revised revenue recognition guidance
    affecting the accounting for software-enabled devices and
    multiple-element arrangements. The revisions expand the scope of
    multiple-element arrangement guidance to include revenue
    arrangements containing certain nonsoftware elements and related
    software elements. Additionally, the revised guidance changes
    the manner in which separate units of accounting are identified
    within a multiple-element arrangement and modifies the manner in
    which transaction consideration is allocated across the
    separately identified deliverables. The Company adopted the
    revised revenue recognition guidance for new arrangements it
    entered into on or after October 1, 2010. The adoption of
    these new requirements did not significantly impact the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance amending the variable
    interest consolidation model. The revised model amends certain
    guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable
    interest entity and requires a qualitative, rather than
    quantitative, analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a
    variable interest entity. The Company’s adoption of the
    amended variable interest consolidation model on October 1,
    2010 did not significantly impact the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Standards

In September 2011, the FASB issued revised annual goodwill
    impairment testing guidance. The revised requirements allow
    entities to first qualitatively assess whether it is necessary
    to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
    Further testing of goodwill for impairment under the
    quantitative model is required only if an entity determines,
    through the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than
    not that a given reporting unit’s fair value is less than
    its carrying amount. The revised goodwill impairment testing
    requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2011 and early adoption is permitted. The
    Company intends to apply the revised requirements in its fiscal
    year 2012 goodwill impairment review processes. No significant
    impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements
    is expected upon adoption of these revised requirements.

    currencies in Latin America, against the U.S. dollar during
    fiscal year 2011.

The income tax (benefit) provision recorded in fiscal years
    2011, 2010 and 2009 for the unrealized (loss) gain on
    investments was $(40), $0 and $25, respectively. The income tax
    (benefit) provision recorded in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009
    for cash flow hedges was $(20,348), $27,509 and $(50,302),

    plans and postemployment plans was $47,575, $67,829 and
    $146,554, respectively. Income taxes are generally not provided
    for translation adjustments.

The unrealized (losses) gains on cash flow hedges included in
    other comprehensive (loss) income for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are
    net of reclassification adjustments of $0, $(19,512), and

Becton,

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

As of September 30, 2011, the Company has certain future
    purchase commitments aggregating to approximately $505,586,
    which will be expended over the next several years.

Contingencies

Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, the Company
    is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss
    that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation
    to which the Company is a party. In accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company
    establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are
    estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without
    considering possible third-party recoveries). In view of the
    uncertainties discussed below, the Company could incur charges
    in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the
    extent available, excess liability insurance. In the opinion of
    management, any such future charges, individually or in the
    aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations and
    consolidated cash flows.

The Company is named as a defendant in the following purported
    class action suits brought on behalf of distributors and other
    entities that purchase the Company’s products (the
    “Distributor Plaintiffs”), alleging that the Company
    violated federal antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of
    higher prices for the Company’s products to the plaintiffs
    and other purported class members.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The plaintiffs in each of the above antitrust class action
    lawsuits seek monetary damages. All of the antitrust class
    action lawsuits have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in
    a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in Federal court in New
    Jersey.

On April 27, 2009, the Company entered into a settlement
    agreement with the Distributor Plaintiffs in these actions. The
    settlement agreement provided for, among other things, the
    payment by the Company of $45,000 in exchange for a release by
    all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under
    federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts
    enumerated in the complaint, and a dismissal of the case with
    prejudice, insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims. The
    release would not cover potential class members that
    affirmatively opt out of the settlement. On September 30,
    2010, the court issued an order denying a motion to approve the
    settlement agreement, ruling that the Hospital Plaintiffs, and
    not the Distributor Plaintiffs, are the direct purchasers
    entitled to pursue damages under the federal antitrust laws for
    certain sales of BD products. The settlement agreement currently
    remains in effect, subject to certain termination provisions,
    and the federal court of appeals has granted the Distributor
    Plaintiffs’ request to appeal the trial court’s order
    on an interlocutory basis. The Company currently cannot estimate
    the range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these
    class action matters beyond the $45,000 already accrued and
    changes to the amount already recognized may be required in the
    future as additional information becomes available.

In June 2007, Retractable Technologies, Inc. (“RTI”)
    filed a complaint against the Company under the caption

Retractable Technologies, Inc. vs. Becton Dickinson and
    Company

(Civil Action

No. 2:07-cv-250,

U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas). RTI
    alleges that the BD
    Integra

tm

syringes infringe patents licensed exclusively to RTI. In its
    complaint, RTI also alleges that the Company engaged in false
    advertising with respect to certain of the Company’s
    safety-engineered products in violation of the Lanham Act; acted
    to exclude RTI from various product markets and to maintain its
    market share through, among other things, exclusionary contracts
    in violation of state and federal antitrust laws; and engaged in
    unfair competition. In January 2008, the court severed the
    patent and non-patent claims into separate cases, and stayed the
    non-patent claims during the pendency of the patent claims at
    the trial court level. RTI seeks money damages and injunctive
    relief. On April 1, 2008, RTI filed a complaint against BD
    under the caption

Retractable Technologies, Inc. and Thomas
    J. Shaw v. Becton Dickinson and Company

(Civil Action

No. 2:08-cv-141,

U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas). RTI
    alleges that the BD
    Integra

tm

syringes infringe another patent licensed exclusively to RTI.
    RTI seeks money damages and injunctive relief. On
    August 29, 2008, the court ordered the consolidation of the
    patent cases. On November 9, 2009, at a trial of these
    consolidated cases, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of RTI
    on all but one of its infringement claims, but did not find any
    willful infringement, and awarded RTI $5,000 in damages. On
    May 19, 2010, the court granted RTI’s motion for a
    permanent injunction against the continued sale by the Company
    of its BD
    Integra

tm

products in their current form, but stayed the injunction for
    the duration of the Company’s appeal. At the same time, the
    court lifted a stay of RTI’s non-patent claims. On
    July 8, 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
    reversed the District Court judgment that the Company’s 3ml
    BD
    Integra

tm

products infringed the asserted RTI patents and affirmed the
    District Court judgment of infringement against the
    Company’s discontinued 1ml BD
    Integra

tm

products. On October 31, 2011, the Federal Circuit Court of
    Appeals denied RTI’s request for an

en banc

rehearing. The trial on RTI’s antitrust and false
    advertising claims is scheduled to begin in February 2012. With
    respect to RTI’s antitrust and false advertising claims, BD
    cannot estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss as
    there are significant legal and factual issues to be resolved.
    In the event that RTI succeeds at trial and subsequent appeals,
    however, any potential loss could be material as RTI will likely
    seek to recover substantial damages including disgorgement of
    profits and damages under the federal antitrust laws which are
    trebled. BD believes RTI’s allegations are without merit.

On October 19, 2009, Gen-Probe Incorporated
    (“Gen-Probe”) filed a patent infringement action
    against BD in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of California. The complaint alleges that the BD
    Viper

tm

and BD
    Viper

tm

XTR

tm

systems and BD
    ProbeTec

tm

specimen collection products infringe certain U.S. patents
    of Gen-Probe. On March 23, 2010, Gen-Probe filed a
    complaint, also in the U.S. District Court



Becton,
    Dickinson and Company

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

for the Southern District of California, alleging that the BD
    Max

tm

instrument infringes Gen-Probe patents. The patents alleged to
    be infringed are a subset of the Gen-Probe patents asserted
    against the Company in the October 2009 suit. On June 8,
    2010, the Court consolidated these cases. Gen-Probe is seeking
    monetary damages and injunctive relief. The Company currently
    cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses for this
    matter as the proceedings are in relatively early stages and
    there are significant issues to be resolved.

The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of
    the above-mentioned suits pending against the Company and is
    engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters.

The Company is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant
    in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary
    course of business.

The Company is a party to a number of Federal proceedings in the
    United States brought under the Comprehensive Environment
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as
    “Superfund,” and similar state laws. The affected
    sites are in varying stages of development. In some instances,
    the remedy has been completed, while in others, environmental
    studies are commencing. For all sites, there are other
    potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally
    liable to pay all cleanup costs.

Note 6 —

Segment
    Data

The Company’s organizational structure is based upon its
    three principal business segments: BD Medical
    (“Medical”), BD Diagnostics (“Diagnostics”)
    and BD Biosciences (“Biosciences”). These segments are
    strategic businesses that are managed separately because each
    one develops, manufactures and markets distinct products and
    services.

The Medical segment produces a broad array of medical devices
    that are used in a wide range of healthcare settings. The
    principal product lines in the Medical segment include needles,
    syringes and intravenous catheters for medication delivery
    (including safety-engineered and auto-disable devices);
    prefilled IV flush syringes; syringes and pen needles for
    the self-injection of insulin and other drugs used in the
    treatment of diabetes; prefillable drug delivery devices
    provided to pharmaceutical companies and sold to end-users as
    drug/device combinations; regional anesthesia needles and trays;
    sharps disposal containers; and closed-system transfer devices.

The Diagnostics segment produces products for the safe
    collection and transport of diagnostic specimens, as well as
    instrument systems and reagents to detect a broad range of
    infectious diseases, healthcare-associated infections
    (“HAIs”) and cancers. The principal products and
    services in the Diagnostics segment include integrated systems
    for specimen collection; safety-engineered blood collection
    products and systems; automated blood culturing systems;
    molecular testing systems for infectious diseases and
    women’s health; microorganism identification and drug
    susceptibility systems; liquid-based cytology systems for
    cervical cancer screening; rapid diagnostic assays; and plated
    media.

The Biosciences segment produces research and clinical tools
    that facilitate the study of cells, and the components of cells,
    to gain a better understanding of normal and disease processes.
    The principal product lines in the Biosciences segment include
    fluorescence-activated cell sorters and analyzers; monoclonal
    antibodies and kits for performing cell analysis; reagent
    systems for life science research; cell imaging systems;
    laboratory products for tissue culture and fluid handling;
    diagnostic assays; and cell culture media supplements for
    biopharmaceutical manufacturing.

The Company evaluates performance of its business segments and
    allocates resources to them primarily based upon operating
    income. Segment operating income represents revenues reduced by
    product costs and operating expenses. From time to time, the
    Company hedges against certain forecasted sales of

U.S.-produced

products sold outside the United States. Gains and losses
    associated with these foreign currency translation hedges are
    reported in segment revenues based upon their proportionate
    share of these international sales of

U.S.-produced

products.



Becton,
    Dickinson and Company

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Distribution of products is primarily through independent
    distribution channels, and directly to end-users by BD and
    independent sales representatives. No customer accounted for 10%
    or more of revenues in any of the three years presented.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company grants share-based awards under the 2004 Employee
    and Director Equity-Based Compensation Plan (“2004
    Plan”), which provides long-term incentive compensation to
    employees and directors consisting of: stock appreciation rights
    (“SARs”), stock options, performance-based restricted
    stock units, time-vested restricted stock units and other stock
    awards.

The amounts and location of compensation cost relating to
    share-based payments included in consolidated statements of
    income is as follows:

Stock
    Appreciation Rights

SARs represent the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of
    common stock having a value equal to the difference between the
    market price of common stock on the date of exercise and the
    exercise price on the date of grant. SARs vest over a four-year
    period and have a ten-year term. The fair value was estimated on
    the date of grant using a lattice-based binomial option
    valuation model that uses the following weighted-average
    assumptions:

Fair value derived

$16.80

$19.70

$16.11

Expected volatility is based upon historical volatility for the
    Company’s common stock and other factors. The expected life
    of SARs granted is derived from the output of the lattice-based
    model, using assumed exercise rates based on historical exercise
    and termination patterns, and represents the period of time that
    SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free
    interest rate used is based upon the published
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
    for instruments with a similar life. The dividend yield is based
    upon the most recently declared quarterly dividend as of the
    grant date. The total intrinsic value of SARs exercised during
    2011, 2010, and 2009 was $9,185, $2,831, and $406, respectively.
    The Company issued 81,848 shares during 2011 to satisfy the
    SARs exercised. The actual tax benefit realized during 2011,
    2010, and 2009 for tax deductions from SAR exercises totaled
    $3,459, $1,031 and $154, respectively. The total fair value of
    SARs vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $31,992, $33,640 and
    $24,888, respectively.

    Company’s performance against pre-established targets,
    including its average growth rate of consolidated revenues and
    average return on invested capital, over a three-year
    performance period. Under the Company’s long-term incentive
    program, the actual payout under these awards may vary from zero
    to 200% of an

employee’s target payout, based on the Company’s
    actual performance over the three-year performance period. The
    fair value is based on the market price of the Company’s
    stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost initially
    recognized assumes that the target payout level will be achieved
    and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the expected outcome
    of performance-related conditions.

    was $75.63 and $62.50, respectively. The total fair value of
    performance-based restricted stock units vested during 2011,

Time-Vested
    Restricted Stock Units

Time-vested restricted stock units generally cliff vest three
    years after the date of grant, except for certain key executives
    of the Company, including the executive officers, for which such
    units generally vest one year following the employee’s
    retirement. The related share-based compensation expense is
    recorded over the requisite service period, which is the vesting
    period or in the case of certain key executives is based on
    retirement eligibility. The fair value of all time-vested
    restricted stock units is based on the market value of the
    Company’s stock on the date of grant.

The weighted average grant date fair value of time-vested
    restricted stock units granted during the years 2010 and 2009
    was $75.58 and $62.96, respectively. The total fair value of
    time-vested restricted stock units vested during 2011, 2010 and
    2009 was $36,009, $36,675 and $29,535, respectively. At
    September 30, 2011, the weighted average remaining vesting
    term of the time-vested restricted stock units is
    1.36 years.

The amount of unrecognized compensation expense for all
    non-vested share-based awards as of September 30, 2011, is
    approximately $80,744, which is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average remaining life of approximately
    2.09 years. At September 30, 2011,
    7,717,344 shares were authorized for future grants under
    the 2004 Plan.

The Company has a policy of satisfying share-based payments
    through either open market purchases or shares held in treasury.
    At September 30, 2011, the Company has sufficient shares
    held in treasury to satisfy these payments in 2011.

Other
    Stock Plans

The Company has a Stock Award Plan, which allows for grants of
    common shares to certain key employees. Distribution of 25% or
    more of each award is deferred until after retirement or
    involuntary termination, upon which the deferred portion of the
    award is distributable in five equal annual installments. The
    balance of the award is distributable over five years from the
    grant date, subject to certain conditions. In February 2004,
    this plan was terminated with respect to future grants upon the
    adoption of the 2004 Plan. At September 30, 2011 and 2010,
    awards for 97,705 and 106,293 shares, respectively, were
    outstanding.

The Company has a Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors which reserves for issuance of 300,000 shares of
    the Company’s common stock. No restricted shares were
    issued in 2011.

The Company has a Directors’ Deferral Plan, which provides
    a means to defer director compensation, from time to time, on a
    deferred stock or cash basis. As of September 30, 2011,
    97,628 shares were held in trust, of which
    4,212 shares represented Directors’ compensation in
    2011, in accordance with the provisions of the plan. Under this
    plan, which is unfunded, directors have an unsecured contractual
    commitment from the Company.

The Company also has a Deferred Compensation Plan that allows
    certain highly-compensated employees, including executive
    officers, to defer salary, annual incentive awards and certain
    equity-based compensation. As of September 30, 2011,
    508,144 shares were issuable under this plan.

At September 30, 2011 the assumed healthcare trend rates
    were 7.6% pre and post age 65, gradually decreasing to an
    ultimate rate of 5.0% beginning in 2024. At September 30,
    2010 the corresponding assumed healthcare trend rates were 7.8%
    pre and post age 65, gradually decreasing to an ultimate
    rate of 4.5% beginning in 2027. A one percentage point increase
    in assumed healthcare cost trend rates in each year would
    increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
    September 30, 2011 by $8,566 and the aggregate of the
    service cost and interest cost components of 2011 annual expense
    by $828. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed
    healthcare cost trend rates in each year would decrease the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
    September 30, 2011 by $7,617 and the aggregate of the 2011
    service cost and interest cost by $723.

Expected
    Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon
    expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved
    by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this
    assumption, the Company considers many factors, including
    historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark
    data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as
    current and expected asset allocations.

Expected
    Funding

The Company’s funding policy for its defined benefit
    pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal
    funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that may be
    appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax
    consequences, the cash flow generated by the Company and other
    factors. While the Company does not anticipate any significant
    required contributions to its pension plans in 2012, the Company
    made a discretionary contribution of $100,000 to its
    U.S. pension plan in October 2011.

Investments

The Company’s primary objective is to achieve returns
    sufficient to meet future benefit obligations. It seeks to
    generate above market returns by investing in more volatile
    asset classes such as equities while at the same time
    controlling risk with allocations to more stable asset classes
    like fixed income.

U.S.
    Plans

The Company’s U.S. plans comprise 69% of total benefit
    plan investments, based on September 30, 2011 market
    values, and have a target asset mix of 65% equities and 35%
    fixed income. This mix was established based on an analysis of
    projected benefit payments and estimates of long-term returns,
    volatilities and correlations for various asset classes. The mix
    is reviewed periodically by the named fiduciary of the plans and
    is intended to provide above-market returns at an acceptable
    level of risk over time.

The established target mix includes ranges by which the target
    may deviate in order to accommodate normal market fluctuations.
    Routine cash flows are used to bring the mix closer to target
    and a move outside of the acceptable ranges will signal the
    potential for a formal rebalancing, based on an assessment of
    current market conditions and transaction costs. Any tactical
    deviations from the established asset mix require the approval
    of the named fiduciary.

The U.S. plans may enter into both exchange traded and
    non-exchange traded derivative transactions in order to manage
    interest rate exposure, volatility, term structure of interest
    rates, and sector and currency exposures within the fixed income
    portfolios. The Company has established minimum credit quality
    standards for counterparties in such transactions.

The U.S. portion of fixed income assets is invested in
    mortgage-backed, corporate, government and agency and
    asset-backed instruments. Mortgage-backed securities consist of
    residential mortgage pass-through certificates. Corporate bonds
    are diversified across industry and sector and, while consisting
    primarily of investment grade instruments, include an allocation
    to high-yield debt as well. U.S. government investments
    consist of obligations of the U.S. Treasury and its
    agencies.

The

non-U.S. portion

of fixed income investments consists primarily of corporate
    bonds in developed markets but includes an allocation to
    emerging markets debt as well. The value of derivative
    instruments is not material and is included in the
    “Other” category provided in the table above.

Equity securities included within the plans’ assets consist
    of publicly-traded U.S. and

non-U.S. equity

securities. In order to achieve appropriate diversification,
    these portfolios are allocated among multiple asset managers and
    invested across market sectors, investment styles,
    capitalization weights and geographic regions.

A portion of the U.S. plans’ assets consists of
    investments in cash and cash equivalents, primarily to
    accommodate liquidity requirements relating to trade settlement
    and benefit payment activity.

Foreign
    Plans

Foreign plan assets comprise 31% of the Company’s total
    benefit plan assets, based on market value at September 30,
    2011. Such plans have local independent fiduciary committees,
    with responsibility for development and oversight of investment
    policy, including asset allocation decisions. In making such
    decisions, consideration is given to local regulations,
    investment practices and funding rules.

    present value of projected cash flows utilizing an income
    approach reflecting the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate
    based on the applicable technological and commercial risk of
    each project. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, the
    Platform technology project was completed, and, as a result, the
    $26,000 associated with this project was reclassified from

and is being amortized over its estimated
    useful life of 20 years. Substantially all of the cash
    flows expected to be generated from the technology will occur
    over this period. The Company expects the

Jaguar Plus Platform to be fully launched with the commencement
    of material cash inflows, in fiscal year 2012, subject to
    regulatory approvals.

The $147,456 of goodwill was allocated to the Diagnostics
    segment. The primary item that generated goodwill is the value
    of the Company’s access to HandyLab’s flexible
    automated platform and expected synergies. No portion of this
    goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The
    Company recognized $2,500 of acquisition-related costs that were
    expensed in the current period and reported in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income as

In May 2009, the Company entered into a twenty-year product
    development and supply agreement with HandyLab. This agreement
    provided the Company with access and distribution rights to
    HandyLab’s proprietary technology. Upon executing this
    agreement, the Company recorded an initial payment for exclusive
    distribution rights over a twelve-year term. At the acquisition
    date, the unamortized balance of the recognized prepaid was
    $2,854. The Company’s acquisition of HandyLab effectively
    settled the preexisting product development and supply
    agreement. Because the terms of the contract were determined to
    represent fair value at the acquisition date, the Company did
    not record any gain or loss separately from the acquisition.

Divestitures

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the Company sold the
    Ophthalmic Systems unit and the surgical blades, critical care
    and extended dwell catheter product platforms for $270,000. The
    Company recognized a pre-tax gain on sale from all of these
    divestitures of $146,478. The results of operations associated
    with the Ophthalmic Systems unit, surgical blade platform and
    critical care platform are reported as discontinued operations
    for all periods presented in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income and Cash Flows and related disclosures. The
    Company agreed to perform contract manufacturing for a defined
    period after the sale of the extended dwell catheter product
    platform. Due to this significant continuing involvement in
    operations, the associated results of operations were reported
    within continuing operations and $18,197 of the gain on sale was
    recognized in

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain
    exposures. The effects these derivative instruments and hedged
    items have on financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows are provided below.

Foreign
    Currency Risks and Related Strategies

The Company has foreign currency exposures throughout Europe,
    Asia Pacific, Canada, Japan and Latin America. From time to
    time, the Company may partially hedge forecasted export sales
    denominated in foreign currencies using forward and option
    contracts, generally with one-year terms. The Company’s
    hedging program has been designed to mitigate exposures
    resulting from movements of the U.S. dollar, from the
    beginning of a reporting period, against other foreign
    currencies. The Company’s strategy is to offset the changes
    in the present value of future foreign currency revenue
    resulting from these movements with either gains or losses in
    the fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts. Forward
    contracts were used to hedge forecasted sales in fiscal year
    2010. The Company did not hedge forecasted sales in fiscal year
    2011 and as of September 30, 2011, the Company has not
    entered into contracts to hedge cash flows for fiscal year 2012.

The Company designates forward contracts used to hedge these
    certain forecasted sales denominated in foreign currencies as
    cash flow hedges. Changes in the effective portion of the fair
    value of the Company’s forward contracts that are
    designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the
    exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is
    attributable to a particular risk) are included in

Other
    comprehensive income (loss)

until the hedged transactions
    are reclassified in earnings. These changes result from the
    maturity of derivative instruments as well as the commencement
    of new derivative instruments. The changes also reflect
    movements in the period-end foreign exchange rates against the
    forward rates at the time the Company enters into any given
    derivative instrument contract. Once the hedged revenue
    transaction occurs, the recognized gain or loss on the contract
    is reclassified from

Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss)

to

Revenues

. The



Becton,
    Dickinson and Company

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Company records the premium or discount of the forward
    contracts, which is included in the assessment of hedge
    effectiveness, to

Revenues

.

In the event that the revenue transactions underlying a
    derivative instrument are no longer probable of occurring,
    accounting for the instrument under hedge accounting is
    discontinued. Gains and losses previously recognized in

Other
    comprehensive income (loss)

are reclassified into

Other
    income (expense)

. If only a portion of the revenue
    transaction underlying a derivative instrument is no longer
    probable of occurring, only the portion of the derivative
    relating to those revenues would no longer be eligible for hedge
    accounting.

Transactional currency exposures that arise from entering into
    transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, in
    non-hyperinflationary countries that are denominated in
    currencies other than the functional currency are mitigated
    primarily through the use of forward contracts and currency
    options. Hedges of the transactional foreign exchange exposures
    resulting primarily from intercompany payables and receivables
    are undesignated hedges. As such, the gains or losses on these
    instruments are recognized immediately in income. The offset of
    these gains or losses against the gains and losses on the
    underlying hedged items, as well as the hedging costs associated
    with the derivative instruments, is recognized in

Other
    income (expense)

.

The total notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding
    foreign exchange contracts as of September 30, 2011 and
    September 30, 2010 were $2,209,780 and $1,776,046,
    respectively.

Interest
    Rate Risks and Related Strategies

The Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from
    changes in U.S. dollar interest rates. The Company’s
    policy is to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed and
    variable rate debt. The Company periodically uses interest rate
    swaps to manage such exposures. Under these interest rate swaps,
    the Company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference
    between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by
    reference to an

agreed-upon

notional principal amount. These swaps are designated as either
    fair value or cash flow hedges.

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges (i.e.,
    hedges against the exposure to changes in the fair value of an
    asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is
    attributable to a particular risk), changes in the fair value of
    the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the
    fixed rate debt due to changes in market interest rates.

Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps designated
    as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability
    in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a
    particular risk) are offset by amounts recorded in

Other
    comprehensive income (loss)

. If interest rate derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges are terminated, the balance in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

attributable to those derivatives is reclassified into
    earnings over the remaining life of the hedged debt. The amount,
    related to terminated interest rate swaps, expected to be
    reclassified and recorded in

Interest expense

within the
    next 12 months is $996, net of tax.

The total notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding
    interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were
    $200,000 at both September 30, 2011 and September 30,
    2010. The outstanding swap represents a

fixed-to-floating

rate swap agreement that was entered into to convert the
    interest payments on $200,000 in 4.55% notes, due
    April 15, 2013, from the fixed rate to a floating interest
    rate based on LIBOR.

The total notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding
    interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of
    September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 were
    $900,000 and $0, respectively. The current year’s
    outstanding swaps include forward starting

fixed-to-floating

rate swap agreements under which the Company agrees to pay a
    fixed interest rate and receive a floating interest rate based
    on LIBOR, subject to mandatory termination and cash settlement
    on the forward start date. These hedges were entered into during
    the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 in anticipation of
    issuing new long-term debt in the first quarter of fiscal



Becton,
    Dickinson and Company

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

year 2012. Their purpose was to partially hedge the risk of
    changes in interest payments attributable to changes in the
    benchmark interest rate (the U.S. Dollar LIBOR swap rate)
    against which the debt was issued. These swaps were terminated
    on November 3, 2011, concurrent with the issuance of the
    new long-term debt. Additional disclosures regarding the
    Company’s issuance of debt in the first quarter of fiscal
    year 2012 are included in Note 14.

Risk
    Exposures Not Hedged

The Company purchases resins, which are oil-based components
    used in the manufacture of certain products. While the Company
    has been able to hedge certain purchases of polyethylene, the
    Company does not currently use any hedges to manage the risk
    exposures related to other resins. Significant increases in
    world oil prices that lead to increases in resin purchase costs
    could impact future operating results. From time to time, the
    Company has managed price risks associated with other commodity
    purchases. The Company had no commodity forward contracts
    outstanding as of September 30, 2011 or 2010.

The Company’s institutional money market accounts permit
    daily redemption and the fair values of these investments are
    based upon the quoted prices in active markets provided by the
    holding financial institutions. The Company’s remaining
    cash equivalents totaling $986,084 and $938,565 at
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Short-term
    investments are held to their maturities and are carried at
    cost, which approximates fair value. The cash equivalents
    consist of liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less and the short-term investments consist of instruments with
    maturities greater than three months and less than one year.

The
    Company measures the fair value of forward exchange contracts
    and currency options using an income approach with significant
    observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates, market
    designated forward currency prices and a discount rate. The fair
    value of interest rate swaps are provided by the financial
    institutions that are counterparties to these arrangements. The
    fair value of long-term debt is based upon quoted prices in
    active markets for similar instruments.

The Company’s policy is to recognize any transfers into
    fair value measurement hierarchy levels and transfers out of
    levels at the beginning of each reporting period. There were no
    transfers in and out of Level 1, Level 2 or
    Level 3 measurements for the years ending
    September 30, 2011 and 2010.

Nonrecurring
    Fair Value Measurements

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company recorded
    an impairment charge of $9,270, which was recorded to

Research and development expense

, resulting from its
    discontinuance of a research program within the Diagnostic
    Systems unit. Based upon an assessment using significant
    unobservable inputs and the lack of alternative uses for these
    assets, the assets were determined to have no fair value.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash deposits in excess of
    government-provided insurance limits. Such cash deposits are
    exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by financial
    institutions. Substantially all of the Company’s trade
    receivables are due from public and private entities involved in
    the healthcare industry. Due to the large size and diversity of
    the Company’s customer base, concentrations of credit risk
    with respect to trade receivables are limited. The Company does
    not normally require collateral. The Company is exposed to
    credit loss in the event of nonperformance by financial
    institutions with which it conducts business. However, this loss
    is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of
    the counterparty to the financial



Becton,
    Dickinson and Company

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

instrument contract exceed the obligations of the Company. The
    Company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a
    diversified group of major financial institutions.

Accounts receivable balances include sales to government-owned
    or government-supported healthcare facilities. Because these
    customers are government-owned or supported, the Company could
    be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or by
    defaults in these countries.

The Company continually evaluates all government receivables,
    particularly in Spain, Italy, and other parts of Western Europe,
    for potential collection risks associated with the availability
    of government funding and reimbursement practices. The Company
    believes the current reserves related to government receivables
    are adequate and this concentration of credit risk is not
    expected to have a material adverse impact on its financial
    position or liquidity.

    debt were 1.20% and 0.27% at September 30, 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. The Company has available a $1 billion
    syndicated credit facility with an expiration date in December
    2012. This credit facility provides backup support for the
    commercial paper program and can also be used for other general
    corporate purposes. It includes a restrictive covenant that
    requires a minimum interest coverage ratio, with which the
    Company was in compliance at September 30, 2011. There were
    no borrowings outstanding under the facility at
    September 30, 2011. In addition, the Company had short-term
    foreign lines of credit pursuant to informal arrangements of
    approximately $231,081 at September 30, 2011, almost all of
    which was unused.

On November 3, 2011, the Company issued $500,000 of

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted on the balance
    sheet by separate tax jurisdictions. At September 30, 2011
    and 2010, net current deferred tax assets of $287,143 and
    $217,865, respectively, were included in

Prepaid expenses,
    deferred taxes and other

. Net non-current deferred tax
    assets of $111,786 and $152,334, respectively, were included in

Current
    Liabilities — Income taxes

. Net non-current
    deferred tax liabilities of $58,553 and $21,558, respectively,
    were included in

Deferred Income Taxes and Other

.
    Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. At
    September 30, 2011, the cumulative amount of such
    undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the
    United States was $3.8 billion. Determining the tax
    liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted is
    not practicable. Deferred taxes are provided for earnings
    outside the United States when those earnings are not considered
    indefinitely reinvested.

The following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized
    tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or
    additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such
    unrecognized tax benefits were settled:

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized,
    would favorably impact the effective tax rate. Included in the
    above total is approximately $8,977 of interest and penalties,
    of which approximately $656 are reflected in the current year
    statement of operations. The Company includes interest and
    penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as a
    component of the Income tax provision on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. The Company expects changes in the
    aggregate amount of unrecognized tax benefits that may occur
    within the next twelve months to be similar to the changes that
    occurred in the prior twelve months.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous
    countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number
    of tax jurisdictions. The IRS has completed its audit for the
    tax years through 2005. For the Company’s other major tax
    jurisdictions where it conducts business, the Company’s tax
    years are generally open after 2005.

Valuation allowances have been established for capital loss
    carryforwards, state deferred tax assets, net of federal tax,
    related to net operating losses and credits and other deferred
    tax assets for which the Company has determined it is more
    likely than not that these benefits will not be realized. At
    September 30, 2011, the Company had deferred state tax
    assets for net state operating losses and credit carryforwards
    of $40,653 for which a valuation allowance of $26,800 has been
    established due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient
    taxable income in the state jurisdictions to utilize the
    deferred tax assets before they principally expire between 2012
    and 2014.

An evaluation was conducted by BD’s management, with the

    Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of BD’s disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of
    September 30, 2011. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
    design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures
    were, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
    effective and designed to ensure that material information
    relating to BD and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made
    known to them by others within these entities. There were no
    changes in BD’s internal control over financial reporting
    during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2011
    identified in connection with the above-referenced evaluations
    that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.
