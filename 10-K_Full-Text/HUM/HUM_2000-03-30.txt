   REPORT ON FORM 10-K

For the Year Ended

PART
   I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

General

Humana Inc. is a Delaware
   corporation organized in 1961. Its principal executive offices are located
   at 500 West Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202 and its telephone number
   at that address is (502) 580-1000. As used herein, the terms the
   “Company” or “Humana” include Humana Inc. and its
   subsidiaries. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains both historical and
   forward-looking information. The forward-looking statements may be
   significantly impacted by risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to
   the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
   of 1995. There can be no assurance that anticipated future results will be
   achieved because actual results may differ materially from those projected
   in the forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that a number of
   factors, which are described herein, could adversely affect the Company
   ’s ability to obtain these results. These include the effects of either
   federal or state health care reform or other legislation, including the

Patients’ Bill of Rights Act

, any changes in the Medicare
   reimbursement system, the ability of health care providers (including
   physician practice management companies) to comply with current contract
   terms, renewal of the Company’s Medicare contracts with the federal
   government, renewal of the Company’s contract with the federal
   government to administer the TRICARE program and renewal of the Company
   ’s Medicaid contracts with various state governments and the Health
   Insurance Administration in Puerto Rico. Such factors also include the
   effects of other general business conditions, including but not limited to,
   the success of the Company’s improvement initiatives including its
   electronic business strategies, premium rate and yield changes,
   retrospective premium adjustments relating to federal government contracts,
   changes in commercial and Medicare HMO membership, medical and pharmacy cost
   trends, compliance with debt covenants, changes in the Company’s debt
   rating and its ability to borrow under its commercial paper program,
   operating subsidiary capital requirements, competition, general economic
   conditions and the retention of key employees. In addition, the Company and
   the managed care industry as a whole are experiencing increased litigation,
   including alleged class action suits challenging various managed care
   practices and suits seeking significant punitive damages awards. (See

Legal Proceedings

section for a description of the Company’s
   significant litigation.) Past financial performance is not necessarily a
   reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use
   historical performance to anticipate results or future period
   trends.

Since 1983, the Company has been a
   health services company that facilitates the delivery of health care
   services through networks of providers to its approximately 5.9 million
   medical members. The Company’s products are marketed primarily through
   health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and preferred provider
   organizations (“PPOs”) that encourage or require the use of
   contracted providers. HMOs and PPOs control health care costs by various
   means, including pre-admission approval for hospital inpatient services,
   pre-authorization of outpatient surgical procedures and risk-sharing
   arrangements with providers. These providers may share medical cost risk or
   have incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective
   manner. The Company also offers various specialty products to employers,
   including dental, group life and workers’ compensation, and
   administrative services (“ASO”) to those who self-insure their
   employee health plans. The Company has entered into a definitive agreement
   to sell its workers’ compensation business. In total, the Company
   ’s products are licensed in 49 states, the District of Columbia and
   Puerto Rico, with approximately 20 percent of its membership in the state of
   Florida.

Acquisitions and
   Dispositions

Between December 30, 1999 and
   February 4, 2000, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its
   workers’ compensation, Medicare supplement and North Florida Medicaid
   businesses for proceeds of approximately $115 million. The Company recorded
   a $118 million loss in 1999 related to these sale transactions.

On January 31, 2000, the Company
   acquired the Memorial Sisters of Charity Health Network (“MSCHN”),
   a Houston based health plan for approximately $50 million in
   cash.

On June 1, 1999, the Company
   reached an agreement with FPA Medical Management, Inc. (“FPA”), FPA
   ’s lenders and a federal bankruptcy court under which the Company
   acquired the operations of 50 medical centers from FPA for approximately $14
   million in cash. The Company has subsequently reached agreements with 14
   provider groups to assume operating responsibility for 38 of the 50 acquired
   FPA medical centers under long-term provider agreements with the
   Company.

On October 17, 1997, the Company
   acquired ChoiceCare Corporation (“ChoiceCare”) for approximately
   $250 million in cash. The purchase was funded with borrowings under the
   Company’s commercial paper program. ChoiceCare provided health services
   products to members in the Greater Cincinnati, Ohio, area.

On September 8, 1997, the Company
   acquired Physician Corporation of America (“PCA”) for total
   consideration of $411 million in cash, consisting primarily of $7 per share
   for PCA’s outstanding common stock and the assumption of $121 million
   in debt. The purchase was funded with borrowings under the Company’s
   commercial paper program. PCA provided comprehensive health services through
   its HMOs in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. In addition, PCA provided workers
   ’ compensation third-party administrative management services. Prior to
   November 1996, PCA also was a direct writer of workers’ compensation
   insurance in Florida. Long-term medical and other expenses payable in the
   accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets includes the long-term portion of
   workers’ compensation liabilities related to this business.

On February 28, 1997, the Company
   acquired Health Direct, Inc. (“Health Direct”) from Advocate
   Health Care for approximately $23 million in cash.

Business
   Segments

During 1999, the Company realigned
   its organization to achieve greater accountability in its lines of business.
   As a result of this realignment, the Company organized into two business
   units: the Health Plan segment and the Small Group segment. The Health Plan
   segment includes the Company’s large group commercial (100 employees
   and over), Medicare, Medicaid, ASO, workers’ compensation and military
   or TRICARE business. The Company has entered into a definitive agreement to
   sell its workers’ compensation business. The Small Group segment
   includes small group commercial (under 100 employees) and specialty benefit
   lines, including dental, life and short-term disability. Results of each
   segment are measured based upon results of operations before income taxes.
   The Company allocates administrative expenses, interest income and interest
   expense, but no assets, to the segments. Members served by the two segments
   generally utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling the Company
   to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. As a result, the
   profitability of each segment is somewhat interdependent. In addition,
   premium revenue pricing to large group commercial employers has historically
   been more competitive than that to small group commercial employers,
   resulting in less favorable underwriting margins for the large group
   commercial line of business. Costs to distribute and administer products to
   small group commercial employers are higher compared to large group
   commercial employers resulting in small group’s higher administrative
   expense ratio.

The following table presents the
   Company’s segment membership and premium revenues by product for the
   year ended December 31, 1999:

Large and Small
   Group Commercial HMO and PPO Products

HMO

An HMO facilitates the delivery of
   prepaid health care services to its members through a network of independent
   primary care physicians, specialty physicians and other health care
   providers who contract with the HMO to furnish such services. Primary care
   physicians generally include internists, family practitioners and
   pediatricians. Generally, access to specialty physicians and other health
   care providers must be approved by the member’s primary care physician.
   These other health care providers include, among others, hospitals, nursing
   homes, home health agencies, pharmacies, mental health and substance abuse
   centers, diagnostic centers, optometrists, outpatient surgery centers,
   dentists, urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers.
   Because access to these specialty physicians and other health care providers
   must generally be approved by the primary care physician, the HMO product is
   the most restrictive form of managed care.

As of March 1, 2000, the Company
   owned and operated 13 licensed and active HMOs, which contracted with
   approximately 62,600 physicians (including approximately 21,100 primary care
   physicians) and approximately 940 hospitals. In addition, the Company had
   approximately 5,100 contracts with other health care providers to provide
   services to HMO members.

An HMO member, typically through
   the member’s employer, pays a monthly fee which generally covers, with
   minimal co-payments, health care services received from or approved by the
   member’s primary care physician. For the year ended December 31, 1999,
   commercial HMO premium revenues totaled approximately $2.2 billion or 23
   percent of the Company’s total premium revenues. Approximately $234
   million of the Company’s commercial HMO premium revenues for the year
   ended December 31, 1999 were derived from contracts with the United States
   Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”), under which the Company
   facilitates the delivery of health care services through the Federal
   Employee Health Benefit Plan (“FEHBP”) to approximately 135,200
   federal civilian employees and their dependents. Pursuant to these
   contracts, payments made by OPM may be retrospectively adjusted downward by
   OPM if an audit discloses that a comparable product was offered by the
   Company to a similar size subscriber group at a lower premium rate than that
   offered to OPM. Management believes that any retrospective adjustments as a
   result of OPM audits will not have a material impact on the Company’s
   financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

PPO

PPO products include many elements
   of managed health care. PPOs are also similar to traditional health
   insurance because they provide a member with the freedom to choose a
   physician or other health care provider. In a PPO, the member is encouraged,
   through financial incentives, to use participating health care providers
   which have contracted with the PPO to provide services at favorable rates.
   In the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care
   provider, the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider
   ’s fees.

As of March 1, 2000, approximately
   397,000 physicians and approximately 3,400 hospitals contracted directly
   with the Company to provide services to PPO members (including the
   ChoiceCare Network described below). The Company also had approximately
   5,000 contracts (including certain contracts which also service the Company
   ’s HMOs) with other providers to provide services to PPO members. In
   addition, the Company had access to 24 leased provider networks throughout
   the country. During 1999, the Company assumed the operational control of a
   previously leased provider network. This new provider network called the
   ChoiceCare Network added approximately 330,000 physicians and other
   providers as well as 2,500 hospitals to the Company’s PPO
   networks.

For the year ended December 31,
   1999, commercial PPO premium revenues totaled approximately $3.0 billion or
   30 percent of the Company’s total premium revenues.

The Company expects that 2000
   commercial HMO and PPO premium rates will increase by approximately 10 to 12
   percent. Over the last five years, changes in the Company’s commercial
   HMO and PPO premium rates have ranged between an approximate two percent
   decrease for the year ended December 31, 1995, to an approximate six percent
   increase for the year ended December 31, 1999, with an average increase of
   approximately three percent.

Medicare
   Products

Medicare is a federal program that
   provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons certain hospital
   and medical insurance benefits, which include hospitalization benefits for
   up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60
   days. Each Medicare-eligible individual is entitled to receive inpatient
   hospital care (“Part A”) without the payment of any premium, but
   is required to pay a premium to the federal government, which is adjusted
   annually, to be eligible for physician care and other services (“Part B
   ”).

Even though participating in both
   Part A and Part B of the traditional Medicare program, beneficiaries are
   still required to pay certain deductible and coinsurance amounts. They may,
   if they choose, supplement their Medicare coverage by purchasing Medicare
   supplement policies which pay these deductibles and coinsurance amounts.
   Many of these policies also cover other services (such as prescription
   drugs) which are not included in Medicare coverage.

Medicare
     HMO

Humana contracts with the federal
   government’s Health Care Financing Administration (“HCFA”)
   under the Medicare+Choice (“M+C”) program, to facilitate the
   delivery of medical benefits in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per
   member for Medicare-eligible individuals residing in the geographic areas in
   which its HMOs operate. Individuals who elect to participate in these
   Medicare programs are relieved of the obligation to pay some or all of the
   deductible or coinsurance amounts but are generally required to use
   exclusively the services provided by the HMO and are required to pay a Part
   B premium to the Medicare program. Generally, the enrollee pays the HMO a
   premium only in cases where the HMO provides additional benefits and where
   competitive market conditions permit. At December 31, 1999, approximately
   48,000 members in six markets were paying premiums, which totaled
   approximately $30 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. In January
   2000, the Company instituted member premiums in additional markets to offset
   the effect of lower HCFA reimbursement rates. During 2000, approximately
   229,000 Medicare HMO members in ten markets, or approximately one-half of
   the Company’s entire Medicare HMO membership, will be paying premiums
   totaling approximately $73 million.

A Medicare HMO product involves
   a contract between an HMO and HCFA pursuant to which HCFA makes a fixed
   monthly payment to the HMO on behalf of each Medicare-eligible individual
   who chooses to enroll for coverage in the HMO. Membership may be terminated
   by the member at any time during the month. The fixed monthly payment is
   determined by formula established by federal law.

As of March 1, 2000, the Company
   facilitates the delivery of Medicare HMO services under eight contracts with
   HCFA in nine states. HCFA contracts covered approximately 488,500 Medicare
   HMO members for which the Company received premium revenues of approximately
   $2.9 billion or 29 percent of the Company’s total premium revenues for
   1999. At December 31, 1999, one such HCFA contract covered approximately
   250,000 members in Florida and accounted for premium revenues of
   approximately $1.5 billion, which represented 51 percent of the Company
   ’s HCFA premium revenues or 15 percent of the Company’s total
   premium revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999. HCFA contracts are
   renewed for a one-year term each January 1 unless terminated 90 days prior
   thereto. Management believes termination of the HCFA contract covering the
   members in Florida would have a material adverse effect on the Company
   ’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Future premiums from HCFA will be
   impacted by new payment methods being developed by HCFA as more fully
   discussed in the

Health Care Reform—National

section. The Company
   ’s 2000 average rate of statutory increase under the HCFA contracts is
   approximately two percent. Over the last five years, annual increases have
   ranged from as low as the January 1999 increase of two percent to as high as
   nine percent in January 1996, with an average of approximately five percent.
   On January 1, 2000, the Company exited 31 counties affecting approximately
   46,000 members resulting, in part, from lower HCFA reimbursement rates. The
   Company intends to offset the effect of lower HCFA reimbursement rates with
   the introduction of member premiums, benefit changes and pursue expansion
   opportunities only in markets that meet the Company’s long-term growth
   strategies.

The loss of the Company’s
   HCFA contracts or significant changes in the Medicare HMO program as a
   result of legislative action, including reductions in payments or increases
   in benefits without corresponding increases in payments, would have a
   material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of
   operations or cash flows.

Medicare
     Supplement

On December 30, 1999, the Company
   reached agreement, subject to regulatory approvals, to transfer
   substantially all of the Company’s 44,500 Medicare supplement policies
   to United Teachers Associates Insurance Company. These policies paid for
   hospital deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance for which an individual
   enrolled in the traditional Medicare program is responsible. For the year
   ended December 31, 1999, Medicare supplement premium revenues totaled
   approximately $60 million or 1 percent of the Company’s total premium
   revenues.

Medicaid
   Product

Medicaid is a federal program that
   is state-operated to facilitate the delivery of health care services to
   low-income residents. Each state which chooses to do so develops, through a
   state specific regulatory agency, a Medicaid managed care initiative which
   must be approved by HCFA. HCFA requires that Medicaid managed care plans
   meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been
   spent on a comparable fee-for-service basis. States currently use either a
   formal proposal process reviewing many bidders or award individual contracts
   to qualified bidders, which apply for entry to the program. In either case,
   the contractual relationship with the state is generally for a one-year
   period. Management believes that the risks associated with participation in
   a state Medicaid managed care program are similar to the risks associated
   with the Medicare HMO product discussed previously. In both instances, the
   Company receives a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which
   it is required to facilitate the delivery of managed health care services to
   enrolled members. Due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform
   and budgetary constraints, more states are utilizing a managed care product
   in their Medicaid programs.

In 1999, the Company renewed a
   two-year contract with the Health Insurance Administration of Puerto Rico to
   facilitate the delivery of health care to Medicaid-eligible individuals. On
   February 4, 2000, the Company entered into a definitive agreement, subject
   to regulatory approvals, to sell its North Florida Medicaid business
   covering approximately 94,000 Medicaid members to Well Care HMO, Inc. For
   the year ended December 31, 1999, premium revenues from the Company’s
   Medicaid products totaled approximately $603 million or 6 percent of the
   Company’s total premium revenues. At December 31, 1999, the Company had
   approximately 410,400 and 206,200 Medicaid members in the Commonwealth of
   Puerto Rico and in four states, respectively.

TRICARE

In 1993, the Company established
   Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the
   Company), to enter into contracts to facilitate the delivery of managed care
   services to the dependents of active duty military personnel and retired
   military personnel and their dependents. In November 1995, the United States
   Department of Defense awarded the Company its first TRICARE contract
   covering approximately 1.1 million eligible beneficiaries in Florida,
   Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Eastern
   Louisiana.

On July 1, 1996, the Company began
   facilitating the delivery of managed health care services to these
   approximate 1.1 million eligible beneficiaries under a potential five-year
   contract (a one-year contract renewable annually for one additional year).
   The government exercised its option to renew the contract for the year
   beginning July 1, 1999. The Company anticipates the government exercising
   its option for the year beginning July 1, 2000 which will be the fifth year
   of the five-year contract period. The Company is in discussion with the
   government concerning two additional one-year renewal periods, however, the
   Company is unable to predict if such an extension will be granted. The
   Company has subcontracted with third parties to provide certain
   administration and specialty services under the contract. Three health
   benefit options are available to TRICARE beneficiaries. In addition to a
   traditional indemnity option, participants may enroll in an HMO-like plan
   with a point-of-service option or take advantage of reduced co-payments by
   using a network of preferred providers. TRICARE premium revenues were
   approximately $866 million or 9 percent of the Company’s total premium
   revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999.

The Company will actively seek
   opportunities to facilitate the delivery of managed care services to
   beneficiaries of federal and state programs, including other TRICARE
   contracts.

Other Related
   Products

The Company offers various
   specialty products to employers, including dental, group life and workers
   ’ compensation, and administrative services (“ASO”) to those
   who self-insure their employee health plans. The Company has entered into a
   definitive agreement to sell its workers’ compensation business.
   Specialty and ASO membership at December 31, 1999 totaled approximately 3.0
   million members and 648,100 members, respectively. Specialty product premium
   revenues were approximately $277 million or 3 percent of the Company’s
   total premiums for the year ended December 31, 1999.

Provider
   Arrangements

In certain situations, the Company
   ’s HMOs contract with individual or groups of primary care physicians,
   generally for an actuarially determined, fixed, per-member-per-month fee
   referred to as a “capitation” payment. Under these arrangements,
   physicians are paid a fixed amount to provide services to their members.
   These contracts typically obligate primary care physicians to provide or
   make referrals to specialty physicians and other providers for the provision
   of all covered managed health care services to HMO members. The capitation
   payment does not vary with the nature or extent of services to the member
   and is generally designed to shift a portion of the HMOs financial risk to
   the primary care physician. The degree to which the Company uses capitation
   arrangements varies by provider.

The Company also contracts with
   medical specialists and other providers to which a primary care physician
   may refer a member. The contracts with specialists may be capitation
   arrangements or may provide
 for payment on a fee-for-service basis based on negotiated fees. Typically,
   payments by the Company to these specialists and other providers reduce the
   ultimate payment that otherwise would be made to primary care physicians.
   The Company’s HMOs also have arrangements under which physicians can
   earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to quality and cost
   effectiveness in the provision of patient care are met. The Company’s
   contracts with capitated physicians generally provide for stop-loss coverage
   so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited
   to a certain amount on an annual basis.

The focal point for cost control
   in the Company’s HMOs is the primary care physician who, under
   contract, provides services and controls utilization of appropriate services
   by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and
   other providers. In addition, the Company’s Hospital Inpatient
   Management System (“HIMS”) controls costs by allowing specially
   trained physicians to manage the entire range of medical care while an HMO
   member is in the hospital, and coordinate the member’s discharge and
   care after discharge. Cost control is further achieved by directly
   negotiating provider discounts. Cost control in the Company’s PPOs is
   achieved primarily by establishing a cost-effective network of participating
   health care providers and providing incentives for members to use such
   providers. These providers are generally paid on a negotiated
   fee-for-service basis. With respect to both HMO and PPO products, cost
   control is further achieved through the use of a utilization review system
   designed to allow only necessary hospital admissions, lengths of stay and
   necessary or appropriate medical procedures. The Company’s HMOs and
   PPOs generally contract for hospital services under per-diem arrangements
   for inpatient hospital services and discounted fee-for-service arrangements
   for outpatient services. During the year ended December 31, 1999,
   approximately 41 percent of the Company’s total medical costs were for
   services provided to its members in hospitals or related
   facilities.

The Company has certain
   risk-sharing contracts whereby providers also assume a specified level of
   risk for covered managed care services to its members. Under these
   risk-sharing arrangements, referred to as global capitation contracts,
   providers are paid a monthly capitation payment per covered member to assume
   risk for all managed care services including professional and institutional
   (i.e. hospital) costs. The capitation payments are based on a specified
   percentage of premiums (typically 78 to 88 percent). The Company continually
   monitors the financial viability and/or effectiveness of these risk-sharing
   arrangements. At December 31, 1999, approximately 30 percent and 45 percent
   of the Company’s commercial and Medicare HMO membership, respectively,
   were under some form of risk-sharing arrangement deemed financially viable
   and/or effective. Under all of its arrangements, the Company remains
   financially responsible for the provision of covered medical services if its
   contractors fail to perform their obligations under the
   contract.

The Company continually contracts
   and seeks to renew contracts with providers at rates designed to ensure
   adequate profitability. To the extent the Company is unable to obtain such
   rates, its financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be
   adversely impacted.

The Company continues to implement
   several disease management programs in various markets. Under these
   arrangements, the Company provides financial incentives for contractors to
   provide the full range of care to members with respect to a particular high
   risk or chronic disease in a quality, cost-effective manner. These programs
   include congestive heart failure, prenatal and premature infant care, asthma
   related illness, end stage renal disease, diabetes and breast cancer
   screening.

Quality
   Assessment

The Company’s quality
   assessment program under its managed care products consists of several
   internal programs such as those that credential providers, and those
   designed to meet the standards of audits by federal and state agencies and
   external accreditation standards. The Company also offers quality and
   outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the Health Plan
   Employer Data Information Sets or HEDIS.

Physicians participating in the
   Company’s HMO networks must satisfy specific criteria, including
   licensing, hospital admission privileges, patient access, office standards,
   after-hours coverage and many other factors. Participating hospitals must
   also meet accreditation criteria established by HCFA and/or the Joint
   Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (“JCAHO
   ”).

Participating physicians are
   recredentialed regularly. Recredentialing of primary care physicians (
   “PCP”) covers many aspects of patient care such as an analysis of
   member grievances filed with the Company, the transfer and termination rate
   of members from a physician practice, analysis of utilization patterns, and
   member surveys. Committees, each composed of a peer group of physicians,
   review participating PCPs being considered for credentialing and
   recredentialing.

The Company pursues accreditation
   for certain of its HMO plans from JCAHO, the National Committee for Quality
   Assurance (“NCQA”) and the American Accreditation Healthcare
   Commission/URAC (“AAHC/URAC”). Accreditation or external review by
   an approved organization is mandatory in the states of Florida and Kansas
   for licensure as an HMO.

JCAHO performs reviews of
   standards for rights, responsibilities and ethics, continuum of care,
   education and communication, health promotion and disease prevention,
   management of human resource information and improving network performance.
   Humana Medical Plan, Inc. in Ft. Walton Beach, Florida received a three-year
   accreditation from JCAHO in 1998.

NCQA performs reviews for quality
   improvement, credentialing, utilization management, preventative health
   member rights and responsibilities and medical records. As of January 31,
   2000, eight of Humana’s markets have received commendable accreditation
   status from NCQA for all HMO product lines. Humana Medical Plan, Inc. in
   Central Florida (which includes Daytona Beach and Orlando), Humana Medical
   Plan, Inc. in North Florida (Jacksonville), Humana Medical Plan, Inc. in
   South Florida, Humana Medical Plan, Inc. in Tampa Bay, Florida, Humana
   Health Plan, Inc. in Chicago, Illinois, Humana Health Plan, Inc. and Humana
   Kansas City, Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri, Humana Health Plan, Inc. in
   Louisville, Kentucky and Humana Health Plan of Ohio, Inc. d/b/a ChoiceCare
   in Cincinnati, Ohio.

AAHC/URAC performs reviews of
   standards for confidentiality, staff qualifications and credentials, program
   qualifications, quality improvement programs, accessibility and on site
   review procedures, information requirements, utilization review procedures
   and appeals. AAHC/URAC accreditation was received for all Humana HMO markets
   which have utilization management functions performed in the Green Bay,
   Wisconsin or Louisville, Kentucky service centers.

The Company’s
   Year 2000 Disclosure Statement

The Company commenced its
   assessment of Year 2000 exposures in early 1996. In December 1998, the
   Company was 100 percent complete with the remediation of its core business
   systems and by December 1999 had remediated 100 percent of its business
   application systems. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had completed all
   Year 2000 initiatives.

To date, the Company has
   experienced no outages or problems related to the Year 2000 date rollover.
   All business systems are functioning normally and the Company has not
   experienced any disruptions in service with third party organizations with
   which it interacts related to the century change.

The Company’s application
   systems are largely developed and maintained in-house by a staff of 400
   application programmers who are versed in the utilization of
   state-of-the-art technology. All application systems are fully integrated
   and automatically pass data through various system processes. The Company
   ’s primary data center and the majority of its programming and support
   staff are located at the Company’s corporate offices in Louisville,
   Kentucky. In order to create the necessary internal focus surrounding the
   Year 2000 issue, the Company established a centralized Year 2000 Program
   Management Office (“PMO”) which is charged with overall
   coordination of enterprise wide Year 2000 initiatives and regular progress
   reporting to the Company’s senior management.

The Year 2000 project is currently
   estimated to have a minimum total cost of approximately $30 million of which
   approximately $10 million was spent during 1999. Year 2000 expenses
   represented less than ten
 percent of the Information Systems budget during 1999. Year 2000 costs are
   expensed as incurred and funded with cash flows from operations. The Company
   does not expect to incur significant Year 2000 project costs in the year
   2000.

The extent and magnitude of the
   Year 2000 project, as it will affect the Company for some period after
   January 1, 2000, is difficult to predict or quantify. In order to mitigate
   these risks, the Company developed business continuity and contingency plans
   which were finalized in the second quarter of 1999. These plans would be
   enacted if Year 2000 problems were to occur within the Company, or if third
   party constituents have failures due to the millennium change. Contingency
   plans were developed for six major functional areas encompassing 22
   operational subdivisions that require contingency plan development. The six
   major functional areas are: providers, service centers, suppliers and
   vendors, customers and brokers, banking and finance and legal
   services.

While the Company presently
   believes that the timely completion of its Year 2000 project limited the
   exposure, so that the Year 2000 issue has not posed material operational
   problems, the Company recognizes that it does not control third party
   constituents. If these third party organizations have failures related to
   the Year 2000 century change and/or fail to properly implement appropriate
   contingency plans, Year 2000 failures may result. These failures could
   potentially have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial
   position, results of operations and cash flows.

Sales and
   Marketing

Individuals become members of the
   Company’s commercial HMOs and PPOs through their employer or other
   groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of managed
   health care products, pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll
   deductions for any premiums payable by the employees. The Company attempts
   to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of managed
   health care benefits by offering HMO and PPO products that facilitate the
   delivery of cost-effective quality care consistent with the needs and
   expectations of the employees or members.

The Company uses various methods
   to market its commercial, Medicare HMO and Medicaid products, including
   television, radio, the Internet, telemarketing and mailings. At December 31,
   1999, the Company used approximately 40,300 licensed independent brokers and
   agents and approximately 510 licensed employees to sell the Company’s
   commercial products. Many of the Company’s employer group customers are
   represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in
   the design and purchase of health care products. The Company generally pays
   brokers a commission based on premiums, with commissions varying by market
   and premium volume.

At December 31, 1999, the Company
   used approximately 950 employed sales representatives, who are each paid a
   salary and/or per member commission, to market the Company’s Medicare
   HMO and Medicaid products. The Company also used approximately 370
   telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of Medicare HMO
   and Medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with
   prospective members.

The following table lists the
   Company’s medical membership at December 31, 1999, by market and
   product:

Risk
   Management

Through the use of internally
   developed underwriting criteria, the Company determines the risk it is
   willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for its commercial
   products. In most instances, employer and other groups must meet the Company
   ’s underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with the
   Company for coverage. Small group reform laws in some states have imposed
   regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance
   products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged
   based upon assessment of health conditions.

Underwriting techniques are not
   employed in connection with Medicare HMO products because HCFA regulations
   require the Company to accept all eligible Medicare applicants regardless of
   their health or prior medical history. The Company also is not permitted to
   employ underwriting criteria for the Medicaid product but rather follows
   HCFA and state requirements. In addition, with respect to the TRICARE
   contract, no underwriting techniques are employed because the Company must
   accept all eligible beneficiaries who choose to participate.

Competition

The managed health care industry
   is highly competitive and contracts for the sale of commercial products are
   generally bid or renewed annually. The Company’s competitors vary by
   local market and include other publicly traded managed care companies,
   national insurance companies and other HMOs and PPOs, including HMOs and
   PPOs owned by Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. Many of the Company’s
   competitors have more membership and/or greater financial resources than the
   Company’s health plans in those markets. The Company’s ability to
   sell its products and to retain customers is or may be influenced by such
   factors as benefits, pricing, contract terms, number and quality of
   participating physicians and other managed health care providers,
   utilization review, claims processing, administrative efficiency,
   relationships with agents, quality of customer service and accreditation
   results.

Government
   Regulation

Government regulation of health
   care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from
   jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Regulatory agencies generally have broad
   discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules.
   Changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered,
   and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change
   periodically. These regulatory revisions could affect the Company’s
   operations and financial results. Also, it may become increasingly difficult
   to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider
   and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and
   regulations.

Enforcement of health care fraud
   and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nation’s law
   enforcement entities. The funding of such law enforcement efforts has
   increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue.
   The focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal
   government health care programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and FEHBP. The
   Company participates extensively in these programs and has enhanced its
   regulatory compliance efforts for these programs. The programs are subject
   to very technical rules. When combined with law enforcement intolerance for
   any level of noncompliance, these rules mean that compliance efforts in this
   area continue to be challenging.

The Company is subject to various
   governmental audits, investigations and enforcement actions. These include
   possible government actions relating to the Employee Retirement Income
   Security Act (“ERISA”), FEHBP, federal and state fraud and abuse
   laws, and laws relating to Medicare, including adjusted community rating
   development, special payment status, payments for emergency room visits, and
   various other areas. Any such government actions could result in assessment
   of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions,
   including exclusion from participation in government programs. The Company
   is currently involved in various government investigations, audits and
   reviews, some of which are under ERISA, and the authority of state
   departments of insurance. The Company does not believe the results of
   current audits or investigations, individually or in the aggregate, will
   have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of
   operations.

Of the Company’s 13 licensed
   and active HMO subsidiaries as of March 1, 2000, nine are qualified under
   the Federal Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, as amended. To
   obtain federal qualification, an HMO must meet certain requirements,
   including conformance with benefit, rating and financial reporting
   standards. In certain markets, and for certain products, the Company
   operates HMOs that are not federally qualified because this provides greater
   flexibility with respect to product design and pricing than is possible for
   federally qualified HMOs.

Six subsidiaries (Humana Medical
   Plan, Inc., Humana Health Plan of Texas, Inc., Humana Health Plan, Inc.,
   Humana Kansas City, Inc., Humana Health Plan of Ohio, Inc., and Memorial
   Sisters of Charity HMO, L.L.C.) hold HCFA contracts under the M+C program to
   sell Medicare HMO products in nine states.

HCFA conducts audits of HMOs
   qualified under its M+C program at least biannually and may perform other
   reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and
   contractual obligations. These audits include review of the HMOs
   administration and management (including management information and data
   collection systems), fiscal stability, utilization management and physician
   incentive arrangements, health services delivery, quality assurance,
   marketing, enrollment and disenrollment activity, claims processing, and
   complaint systems.

HCFA regulations require quarterly
   and annual submission of financial statements. In addition, HCFA requires
   certain disclosures to HCFA and to Medicare beneficiaries concerning
   operations of a health plan qualified under the M+C program. HCFA’s
   rules require disclosure to members upon request of information concerning
   financial arrangements and incentive plans between an HMO and physicians in
   the HMO’s networks. These rules also require certain levels of
   stop-loss coverage to protect contracted physicians against major losses
   relating to patient care, depending on the amount of financial risk they
   assume. The reporting of certain health care data contained in HEDIS is
   another important HCFA disclosure requirement.

The Company’s Medicaid
   products are regulated by the applicable state agency in the state in which
   the Company sells a Medicaid product and the Health Insurance Administration
   in Puerto Rico, in conformance with federal approval of the applicable state
   plan, and are subject to periodic reviews by these agencies. The reviews are
   similar in nature to those performed by HCFA.

Laws in each of the states and the
   Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which the Company operates its HMOs, PPOs and
   other health insurance-related services regulate the Company’s
   operations, including the scope of benefits, rate formulas, delivery
   systems, utilization review procedures, quality assurance, complaint
   systems, enrollment requirements, claim payments, marketing and advertising.
   The HMO, PPO and other health insurance-related products offered by the
   Company are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance
   regulators and the entities selling these products are required to be in
   compliance with certain minimum capital requirements. These requirements
   must be satisfied by investing in approved investments that generally cannot
   be used for other purposes. Under state laws, the Company’s HMOs and
   health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for
   financial and contractual compliance, and its HMOs are audited for
   compliance with health services standards by respective state departments of
   health. Most states’ laws require such audits to be performed at least
   triennially.

The Company and its licensed
   subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company
   and Commonwealth of Puerto Rico regulations. These regulations require,
   among other things, prior approval and/or notice of certain material
   transactions, including dividend payments, intercompany agreements and the
   filing of various financial and operational reports.

The National Association of
   Insurance Commissioners has recommended that states adopt a risk-based
   capital (“RBC”) formula for companies established as HMO entities,
   similar to the current requirement for insurance companies. The RBC
   provisions may require new minimum capital and surplus levels for some of
   the Company’s HMO subsidiaries. Many states have not yet determined
   when they will adopt the RBC formula or if they will allow a phase-in to the
   required levels of capital and surplus.

The Company currently maintains
   approximately $768 million of capital and surplus in its health insurance
   and HMO entities, compared to the minimum statutory required capital and
   surplus levels of approximately $569 million. If the states in which the
   Company conducts business adopt the proposed RBC formula, without a phase-in
   provision, the Company estimates it would be required to fund additional
   capital into certain of its subsidiaries of approximately $45 million. After
   this capital infusion, the Company would have $138 million of capital and
   surplus above the required RBC level in its entities as a whole.

Management works proactively to
   ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting the
   Company’s business.

Health Care
   Reform

There continue to be diverse
   legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels
   to address aspects of the nation’s health care system.

National

In 1999, Congress passed the
   Medicare, Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Program
   Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (“BBRA”) amending certain
   provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA”). The BBA
   revised the structure of and payment for private health plan options for
   Medicare enrollees under the M+C program. The BBRA improved reimbursement to
   M+C contracting organizations, made certain other technical corrections to
   ease administrative burdens and required that the Medicare Payment Advisory
   Commission issue a report on the impact of risk-adjusted
   payment.

Under the health risk-adjusted
   payment mechanism for M+C plans, health plan payments are adjusted based on
   the likelihood (or risk) that enrollees will use health care services. The
   BBRA slowed the phase-in
 period of the risk-adjustment payment mechanism to 10 percent in 2000, 10
   percent in 2001 and 20 percent in 2002. The Company believes that Congress
   may again consider modifications to the payment formula during the
   intervening years.

The BBRA also increased future
   health plan payments by reducing from 0.5 percent to 0.3 percent, the
   difference in the annual growth rate allowed for M+C plans and traditional
   Medicare in 2002. Further, effective January 1, 2001, Congress changed the
   formula by which health plans pay for the national Medicare education
   campaign from one where M+C plans pay the entire amount based on number of
   plan enrollees to one based on a ratio of plan enrollees to the total
   Medicare population. Organizations that offer M+C plans in areas without
   such plans since 1997 will receive bonus payments in their first two
   years.

While the Company believes that
   these adjustments modestly restore some Medicare reimbursement, pending
   legislative and regulatory initiatives could cause the Company to again
   consider increasing enrollee out-of-pocket costs, modifying benefits or
   exiting markets in 2001. On January 1, 2000, the Company exited 31 M+C
   counties and raised or established premiums and reduced benefits in others.
   The Company is working with HCFA on modifications to the risk adjuster
   payment method.

The Health Insurance Portability
   and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) was enacted in 1996. The
   provisions of HIPAA that have already been implemented govern rules related
   to portability and guarantee issue requirements. Final rules mandated by
   HIPAA on privacy standards, administrative simplification of employer,
   provider and health plan identification information, claims transaction
   codes, security and electronic signatures will be proposed or promulgated in
   2000. The Company is taking administrative steps to be in full compliance
   with the rules once finalized.

There are several other
   legislative proposals under consideration that include, among other things,
   a patient bill of rights, expansion of a patient’s right to sue,
   protecting patient medical information, greater access to health insurance
   for the uninsured, provisions that seek to reduce the number of uninsured by
   expanding medical savings accounts, the acceleration of the self-employed
   tax deduction, collective bargaining rights for independent physicians, and
   provisions to permit employers to pool at the federal or state level. Many
   of these proposals may require additional administrative costs to ensure
   compliance and the Company is currently assessing their cost and impact on
   premiums for the future.

State

A number of states continue to
   enact some form of managed care reform. Issues relating to managed care
   consumer protection standards, including increased plan information
   disclosure, expedited appeals and grievance procedures, third party review
   of certain medical decisions, health plan liability, access to specialists,
   clean claim payment timing, physician collective bargaining rights and
   confidentiality of medical records continue to be under discussion. Further,
   proposals that place restrictions on the selection and termination of
   participating health care providers also are receiving review. A few states
   are also expected to consider small group purchasing alliance and small
   group rating legislation.

Management believes that managed
   care and health care in general will continue to be scrutinized and may lead
   to additional legislative health care reform initiatives. Management is
   unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be
   changed or interpreted, what additional laws or regulations affecting the
   Company’s businesses may be enacted or proposed, when and which of the
   proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and
   regulations will have on its financial position, results of operations or
   cash flows.

Other

Captive
     Insurance Company

The Company insures substantially
   all professional liability risks through a wholly owned subsidiary (the
   “Subsidiary”). The annual premiums paid to the Subsidiary are
   determined by independent actuaries. The Subsidiary reinsures levels of
   coverage for losses in excess of its retained limits with unrelated
   insurance carriers.

Centralized
     Management Services

Centralized management services
   are provided to each health plan from the Company’s headquarters and
   service centers. These services include management information systems,
   product administration, financing, personnel, development, accounting, legal
   advice, public relations, marketing, insurance, purchasing, risk management,
   actuarial, underwriting and claims processing.

Employees

As of December 31, 1999, the
   Company had approximately 17,300 employees, including approximately 330
   employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company has not
   experienced any work stoppages and believes it has good relations with its
   employees.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

The Company owns its principal
   executive office, which is located in the Humana Building, 500 West Main
   Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. In addition, the Company owns buildings
   in Louisville, Kentucky, San Antonio, Texas and Green Bay, Wisconsin and
   Jacksonville, Florida and leases facilities in Madison, Wisconsin, all of
   which are used for customer service and claims processing. The Louisville
   and Green Bay facilities also perform enrollment processing and other
   corporate functions.

The Company also owns or leases
   medical centers ranging in size from approximately 1,500 to 80,000 square
   feet. The Company’s administrative market offices are generally leased,
   with square footage ranging from approximately 700 to 89,000. The following
   chart lists the location of properties used in the operation of the Company
   at December 31, 1999:

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Securities
     Litigation

Six purported class action
   complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the
   Western District of Kentucky at Louisville, by purported stockholders of the
   Company against the Company and certain of its current and former directors
   and officers. The six complaints contain the same or substantially similar
   allegations; namely, that the Company and the individual defendants
   knowingly or recklessly made false or misleading statements in press
   releases and public filings concerning the Company’s financial
   condition, primarily with respect to the impact of the negotiations over
   renewal of the Company’s contract with Columbia/HCA which took effect
   April 1, 1999. The complaints allege violations of Section 10(b) of the
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”) and SEC Rule 10b-5,
   and Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act and seek certification of a class of
   stockholders who purchased shares of Humana common stock starting either (in
   four complaints) in late October 1998 or (in two complaints) on February 9,
   1999 and ending (in all six complaints) on April 8, 1999. All seek money
   damages in unspecified amounts, plus (in certain of the complaints)
   pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and costs and expenses including
   attorney and expert fees. Plaintiffs moved for consolidation of the actions,
   now styled

In re Humana Inc. Securities Litigation

, and have filed a
   Consolidated Complaint.

In late 1997, three purported
   class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for
   the Southern District of Florida by former stockholders of Physician
   Corporation of America (“PCA”) against PCA and certain of its
   former directors and officers. The three actions were consolidated into a
   single action entitled

In re Physician Corporation of America Securities
   Litigation

, Civil Action No. 97-3678 (S.D. Fla.). The Consolidated
   Complaint alleges that PCA and the individual defendants knowingly or
   recklessly made false and misleading statements in press releases and public
   filings with respect to the financial and regulatory difficulties of PCA
   ’s workers’ compensation business. Count I alleges violations of
   Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, and Count II alleges
   violations of Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act. Plaintiffs have moved for
   certification of a class of stockholders who purchased shares of PCA common
   stock from March 31, 1996 through March 31, 1997, as well as money damages
   plus prejudgment interest in an unspecified amount, and costs and expenses
   including attorneys fees. On February 19, 1999, the U.S. District Court
   denied PCA’s motion to dismiss. On May 5, 1999, plaintiffs moved for
   certification of the purported class. On June 28, 1999, defendants moved for
   partial summary judgment and filed papers opposing the motion for class
   certification. Both motions are currently pending. Discovery is proceeding
   and the action has been set for trial beginning January 2001.

The Company believes that the
   above allegations are without merit and intends to pursue the defense of the
   actions vigorously.

Managed Care
     Industry Litigation

Since October 1999, the Company
   has received twelve purported class action complaints filed on behalf of
   various named plaintiffs who seek to represent a class consisting of present
   and former Humana subscribers but excluding persons insured by Medicare or
   Medicaid. All of the cases have been filed in federal courts, ten in the
   Southern District of Florida, one in the Southern District of Mississippi
   and one in the Northern District of Alabama. In each case, the plaintiffs
   seek a recovery (including statutory treble damages) under the Racketeer
   Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) for all persons
   who are or were Humana subscribers at any time during the four-year period
   prior to the filing of the complaints. In addition, plaintiffs seek to
   represent a subclass of policyholders who purchased their Humana coverage
   through their employers’ health benefits plans governed by ERISA, and
   who are or were Humana subscribers at any time during the six-year period
   prior to filing the complaints.

The plaintiffs’ complaints,
   which are generally the same, allege, among other things, that Humana
   intentionally concealed from its members information concerning the various
   ways Humana decides what claims will be paid, what procedures will be deemed
   medically necessary, and what criteria and procedures are used to determine
   the extent and type of their coverage. Plaintiffs also allege that Humana
   concealed from members the existence of direct financial incentives to
   treating physicians and other health care providers to deny coverage. The
   plaintiffs generally do not allege that any of the alleged practices
   resulted in any named plaintiff, or any other specific member, being denied
   coverage for services that should have been covered but, instead, claim that
   Humana provided the purported class with health insurance benefits of lesser
   value than promised. Humana has asked the Federal Judicial Panel on
   Multidistrict Litigation (“MDL Panel”) to consolidate the
   management of all of these cases in a single court.

Humana has also received a class
   action suit filed in state court in Louisville, Kentucky, by named
   plaintiffs who seek to represent a purported nationwide class of providers
   who allege that the Company has
 improperly paid them and has “downcoded” their claims by paying
   lesser amounts than they billed for. The Company has removed the case to
   federal court and has asked the MDL Panel to consolidate that case with the
   ones described above as well as with another case brought by a physician
   plaintiff in Alabama and two others brought by physicians in South
   Florida.

The Company believes these actions
   are without merit and intends to pursue the defense of these actions
   vigorously.

Mary Forsyth, et al. V. Humana Inc., et al.

A class action lawsuit styled

Mary Forsyth, et al. V. Humana Inc., et al.,

Case No.
   CV-5-89-249-PMP, was filed on March 29, 1989, in the United States District
   Court for the District of Nevada involving claims arising out of the method
   of calculation of coinsurance for Nevada insureds prior to 1988, and an
   antitrust claim. The District Court granted the Company’s motion for
   summary judgment on most of the claims on July 22, 1993. The District Court
   granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the claims under ERISA.
   On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reinstated certain
   claims, including the claim under RICO on behalf of a class of insureds who
   paid coinsurance at Humana hospitals (the “Co-Payer Class”), and
   the antitrust claim. On August 18, 1997, the Company filed a Petition for
   Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court requesting the Supreme
   Court to reverse the part of the Ninth Circuit ruling reinstating the RICO
   claim of the Co-Payer Class. In January 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that
   the plaintiffs could pursue their RICO claim. The parties subsequently
   entered into a settlement agreement on July 16, 1999 resolving all
   outstanding claims. The District Court entered its final approval of the
   settlement agreement on November 30, 1999. The Company’s portion of the
   settlement which was paid in 1999 was $11.2 million and since it had
   previously established adequate liabilities for the resolution of this
   matter, the settlement did not have a material impact on the Company’s
   financial position or its results of operations.

Chipps v. Humana Health Insurance Company of Florida,
     Inc.

On January 4, 2000, a jury in Palm
   Beach County, Florida issued a verdict against Humana Health Insurance
   Company of Florida, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, awarding
   approximately $80 million to Mark Chipps, an insured who had sued
   individually and on behalf of his minor daughter. The claim arose from the
   removal of the child from a case management program which had provided her
   with benefits in excess of those available under her policy. The award
   included $78.5 million for punitive damages, $1 million for emotional
   distress and $29,000 for contractual benefits. On March 13, 2000, the Humana
   Health Insurance Company of Florida, Inc., filed its notice of appeal to the
   Fourth District Court of Appeals in Florida.

Government
     Audits and Other

During 1999, the Company reached
   agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice and the
   Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) on a $15 million
   settlement relating to Medicare premium overpayments. The overpayments
   resulted from the erroneous designation of certain Medicare enrollees as
   also eligible for Medicaid. In conjunction with the settlement, the Company
   is also negotiating with the Office of the Inspector General of HHS with
   respect to the terms of a corporate integrity agreement which is expected to
   be finalized during the second quarter of 2000. The settlement amount is
   expected to be paid sometime during 2000. The Company previously established
   adequate liabilities for the resolution of these issues and, therefore, the
   settlement will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
   position or results of operations.

Damages for claims for personal
   injuries and medical benefit denials are usual in the Company’s
   business. Personal injury and medical benefit denial claims are covered by
   insurance from the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary
   and excess carriers, except to the extent that claimants seek punitive
   damages, which may not be covered by insurance if awarded in states in which
   insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted. In connection with
   the case of

Chipps v. Humana Health Insurance Company of Florida,
   Inc.,

the Company’s insurance carriers have preliminarily indicated
   that they believe no coverage may be available
 for a punitive damages award. Other potential liabilities may not be covered
   by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the amount of insurance may
   not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, insurance coverage
   for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or
   prohibitively expensive in the future.

Due to the nature of its business,
   the Company is or may become subject to pending or threatened litigation or
   other legal actions relating to the failure to provide or pay for health
   care or other benefits, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged under
   the Company’s programs, nonacceptance or termination of providers,
   failure to return withheld amounts from provider compensation, and failure
   to disclose network discounts and various provider payment arrangements and
   claims relating to contract performance. Recent court decisions and
   legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of
   claims.

Management does not believe that
   any pending or threatened legal actions against the Company or audits by
   agencies will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
   position or results of operations. However, the likelihood or outcome of
   current or future suits cannot be accurately predicted, and they could
   adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of
   operations or cash flows.
