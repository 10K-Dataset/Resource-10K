PART I

Item 1. 	Business

General

Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”)
was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The Company is an international service
company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries
to both residential and commercial customers in North America and Australia with international franchises in Central America, the
Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that
specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, LLC. (“Orkin”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite control company. It provides
customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin either serves customers, directly or through franchises operations, in the United
States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico providing
essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels,
food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the Orkin

®

,
and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes
Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand name provides similar brand
recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada’s largest pest control provider and a leader in the
development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western Pest Services (“Western”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial
pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers focusing on the northeastern United
States.

The Industrial Fumigant Company (“IFC”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest
management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam Pest Defense (“HomeTeam”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition,
HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx

®

tubes in the wall pest control system, was recognized as a premier pest control
business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders nationally.

Rollins Australia (“Rollins Australia”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”), in February 2014. Allpest was established
in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional commercial, residential, and termite service as
well as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity program and provides specialized services
to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.

Rollins Wildlife Services, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, acquired Critter Control February 27, 2015. Critter Control was established by Kevin Clark in 1983 and
is headquartered in Traverse City, Michigan. The business is currently 100% franchised with operations in 40 states and 2 Canadian
provinces.

The Company has several smaller wholly-owned
subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The Company has only one reportable
segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, which includes
the United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa,
and Mexico are included in Item 8 of this document, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” on pages 27.
The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers
or the Company’s foreign operations.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

All share and per share data presented
have been adjusted to account for the three-for-two stock split effective March 10, 2015. At the July 2012 Board of Directors’
meeting, the Board authorized the purchase of 7.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock. During the years ended December
31, 2015 and 2014, the Company repurchased on the open market 19 thousand shares and 1.5 million shares at a weighted average price
of $22.42 and $19.46, respectively. In total, there are 5.9 million additional shares authorized to be repurchased under prior
Board approval. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.


Backlog

Backlog services and orders are usually
provided within the month following the month of order receipt, except in the area of prepaid pest control and bait monitoring
services, which are usually provided within twelve months of order receipt. The Company does not have a material portion of its
business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a governmental entity.

Franchising Programs

Orkin Franchises

The Company continues to expand its growth
through Orkin’s franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently not economically
feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are subject to a contractual buyback provision at Orkin’s
option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise. International franchise agreements
also contain an optional buyback provision; however, the franchisee has the prior right of renewal of agreement. The Company through
its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994, and established its first international
franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean,
Europe, Africa, and Mexico.

Seasonality

The business of the Company is affected
by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as
well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change
in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the Company’s pest and termite control operations
during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The Company has relationships with a
national pest control product distributor and other vendors for pest and termite control treatment products. The Company maintains
a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing needs and to alleviate any potential
short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers.


Competition

The Company believes that Rollins, through
its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, Orkin Canada, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company,
Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, Trutech, Permatreat, Rollins Australia and Critter Control, competes favorably with competitors
as the world’s largest pest and termite control company. The Company’s competitors include Terminix, Ecolab and Rentokil.

The principal methods of competition
in the Company’s pest and termite control markets are quality of service, customer proximity and guarantee terms, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, and price.

Research and Development

Expenditures by the Company on research
activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and improved service methods
and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies. Also, a portion of these methods
and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.

The Company maintains a close relationship
with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.

The Company conducts tests of new products
with the specific manufacturers of such products.  The Company also works closely with leading scientists, educators, industry
consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

The Company’s pest control business
is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment, public health and consumers.
Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the Company’s financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Federal Insecticide Fungicide
and Rodentcide Act (“FIFRA”)

This federal law (as amended) grants
to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control companies operate.
Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the following: licensing, record keeping,
contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This allows each state to institute certain features
that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens’ wishes in each state. The pest control
industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food Quality Protection Act
of 1996 (“FQPA”)

The FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling,
handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts its business.

Environmental Remediation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, is the primary Federal statute regulating the cleanup
of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. Responsibilities governed
by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous substances, and establishing the
necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will work with the EPA and under the direction
of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Consistent with the Company’s responsibilities
under these regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments and remediation of hazardous substances from time to
time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these situations arise, the Company accrues management’s
best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management’s current estimates of these costs, management does
not believe these costs are material to the Company’s financial condition or operating results.

Employees

The number of persons employed by the
Company as of January 31, 2016 was approximately 11,000.

and Exchange Commission.

Item 1.A.

Risk Factors

We may not be able to maintain our
competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry.
Our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices, and general economic issues. We compete with
other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a finite number of customers. We believe
that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality, and product availability, terms of
guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe that our experience and reputation for
safety and quality service is excellent, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.

Economic conditions may adversely affect
our business

Pest and termite services represent
discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers. As consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures, we may
suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers,
including food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse
economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial
businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.

We may not be able to identify, complete
or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions have been and may continue
to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable
acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully
the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Any inability on our part to integrate and manage the
growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are affected by adverse
weather conditions.

Our operations are directly impacted
by the weather conditions across the United States, Canada, and Australia. The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal
nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis
of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically
resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods.
The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for
extended periods.

Our inability to attract and retain
skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our ability to remain productive and
profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand our operations
is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees is high, and the supply is very
limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force,
increases in wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and profitability could be diminished,
and our growth potential could be impaired.

Our operations could be affected
by pending and ongoing litigation.

In the normal course of business, some
of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that plaintiffs have been
damaged.  The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate,
will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome
of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual
year

.

Our operations may be adversely affected
if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our business is significantly affected
by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of
enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how such laws and
regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted.
We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations. We
also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, such environmental
laws are changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations
and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective
actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.


The Company’s Management Has
a Substantial Ownership Interest; Public Stockholders May Have No Effective Voice In the Company’s Management

The Company has elected the “Controlled
Company” exemption under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) Listed Company Manual. The Company
is a “Controlled Company” because a group that includes the Company’s Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins
and his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and a director of the Company and certain
companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company’s voting power. As a “Controlled
Company,” the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.

Rollins, Inc.’s executive officers,
directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 56 percent
of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of
the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval
of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing
a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Item 1.B.       Unresolved Staff Comments

None

Item 2.       Properties.

The Company’s administrative headquarters
are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The Company owns or leases over
500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins Training Center located in Atlanta, Georgia,
the Rollins Customer Service Center located in Covington, Georgia, and the Pacific Division Administration and Training Center
in Riverside, California. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important physical property
of the Company. The facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3.       Legal
Proceedings.

In the normal course of business, certain
of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations which allege that the subsidiaries’
services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases and claims from time to time. We are involved
in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. We are actively contesting each of these matters.

The Company and a subsidiary, The Industrial
Fumigant Company, LLC, were named defendants in

Severn Peanut Co. and Meherrin Agriculture & Chemical Co. v. Industrial
Fumigant Co., et al.

The

Severn

lawsuit, a matter related to a fumigation service, was filed in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  The trial court dismissed all of Plaintiffs’ claims in 2014;
and the court of appeals affirmed the rulings in December, 2015.

On December 2, 2014, Plaintiff Killian Pest
Control sued Rollins, Inc., its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense, and alleged that HomeTeam’s exclusive use of its “tubes
in the walls” system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, and California’s Cartwright Act and Business and Professions
Code. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the Sherman and Cartwright Acts, and the Business
and Professions Code; a permanent injunction against continuing alleged violations; and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending
in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. The Company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, because
the lawsuit is at an early stage and involves unresolved issues of law and fact. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.

On December 2, 2014, Plaintiff Jose Luis Garnica,
on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated customers, sued Rollins, Inc., its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense, and
alleged that HomeTeam’s exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust
Act. The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the Sherman Act; a permanent injunction against
continuing violations; and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California.
The Company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, because the lawsuit is at an early stage and involves unresolved issues
of law and fact. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.

Management does not believe that any pending
claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters,
however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

The Company

Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”)
was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc. The Company is an international
service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned
subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America and Australia with international franchises in Central
America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico. Services are performed
through a contract that specifies the treatment specifics and the pricing arrangement with the customer.

The Company has only one reportable
segment, its pest and termite control business. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant
upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company’s foreign operations.

General Operating Comments

2015 marked the Company’s 18th
consecutive year of improved revenues and profits. Revenues for the year rose 5.2 percent to $1.485 billion compared to $1.412
billion for the prior year. Income before income taxes increased 10.8% to $243.2 million compared to $219.5 million the prior year.
Net income increased 10.5% to $152.1 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.70 compared to $137.7 million, or $0.63 per
diluted share for the prior year.

All of our business lines experienced
growth for the year, with residential pest control revenues up 6.6%, commercial pest control revenues up 3.3% and termite revenues
up 4.6%.

We are pleased with the success we had
with the rollout of our CRM system (BOSS) during the year. We ended 2015 with 50 percent of our Orkin branches on the system. We
currently expect to have all Orkin locations on BOSS by the end of the third quarter of this year.

Orkin recently announced that we extended
our presence in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, with the addition of nine new franchises. Our new
franchises are located in Mexico, Colombia, Republic of Georgia, Qatar, China, and South Korea. As of December 31, 2015, Orkin
has 48 international franchises. We look to expand our domestic and international franchise footprint, while continuing to work
closely with our current franchise partners to help them grow their businesses.

Strategic acquisitions remain a priority
for Rollins, and as in the past, we will continue to seek out companies that are a “fit” for us in both, the pest control
and wildlife areas of our business.

Results of Operations—2015
Versus 2014

Overview

The Company’s gross margin increased
to 50.4% for 2015 from 49.9% in 2014. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased in 2015 to 31.2% of revenue versus 31.3%
in 2014. The Company’s depreciation and amortization margin decreased 0.1 point to 3.0 % in 2015 compared to 3.1% in 2014.
Rollins’ net income of $152.1 million in 2015 was an increase of $14.5 million or 10.5% over $137.7 million in 2014. Net
profit margin improved to 10.2% in 2015 from 9.8% in 2014.


Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December
31, 2015 were $1.485 billion, an increase of $73.7 million or 5.2% from 2014 revenues of $1.412 billion. Growth occurred across
all service lines and brands with our foreign companies being hurt by unfavorable exchange rates. Organic growth and pricing accounted
for approximately 4.2% of our increase and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth. Commercial pest control represented
approximately 41% of the Company’s revenue in 2015 and grew 3.3% in 2015 due to increases in sales, improvements in cancellations,
increased bed bug revenue, an increase in commercial fumigations, and acquisitions. Residential pest control which also represented
approximately 41% of the Company’s revenue, increased 6.6% driven by increased leads, closures and pricing as well as increased
TAEXX® homebuilder installations, bed bug revenues and acquisitions. The Company’s termite business, which represented
approximately 17% of the Company’s revenue, grew 4.6% in 2015 due to increases in drywood fumigations and ancillary service
sales, and acquisitions.

The Company implemented its traditional
price increase program in June 2015. Less than 2% of the Company’s revenue increase came from pricing actions. Nearly 80%
of the Company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2015 and 2014.

The Company’s foreign operations
accounted for approximately 7% and 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Currency
exchange translation is the cause of the decreased percentage. The Company established new franchises in China, El Salvador, Mexico,
Colombia, the Republic of Georgia, Bahrain, Qatar, Hong Kong, China, Macau, and South Korea in 2015 for a total of 48 international
franchises at December 31, 2015 with 37 at December 31, 2014. Orkin had 99 and 92 franchises (domestic and international) at December
31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December
31, 2015 cost of services provided increased $28.2 million or 4.0%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Gross
margin for the year increased to 50.4% for 2015 compared to 49.9% for 2014 due to reduced fleet costs due to the drop in gasoline
prices, favorable service salaries as we continue to improve our routing and scheduling to maximize efficiencies and favorable
administrative salary margins as we continue to focus on efficiency. The favorable margins were partially offset by our casualty
claim development, increases in supplies as a result of increased sales and increases in personnel related costs as group premiums
continue to increase. We experienced good cost controls across most spending categories.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015,
depreciation and amortization increased $1.0 million, or 2.3% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The dollar
increase was due primarily to depreciation increasing $2.7 million as we depreciate our customer relationship management software
“BOSS”, while amortization of intangible assets decreased as we fully amortized several intangible assets during the
12 month period.

Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December
31, 2015, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $22.0 million, or 5.0% compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2014. SG&A decreased to 31.2% of revenues compared to 31.3% of revenues in the prior year. As a percentage
of revenues, SG&A decreased due to the Company’s leveraging our SG&A expenses against higher revenues, reducing our
bad debt expense with our collections efforts and experiencing lower gasoline costs, partially offset by higher sales salaries.

Gain on Sales of assets, Net

Gain on sales of assets, net increased
to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $0.6 million gain in 2014. The Company recognized gains from the
sale of owned vehicles and property in 2015 and 2014. The increase was due to the Company selling two buildings in 2015.

Interest (Income)/Expense, Net

Interest income, net for the year ended
December 31, 2015 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to $0.3 million in 2014. Interest income for the year is
due to interest received on cash balances in the Company’s various cash accounts.

Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate increased
to 37.4% in 2015 compared to 37.3% in 2014, due primarily to differences in state and foreign income taxes.


Results of Operations—2014
Versus 2013

Overview

The Company’s gross margin increased
to 49.9% for 2014 from 49.3% in 2013. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased in 2014 to 31.3% of revenue versus 32.0%
in 2013. The Company’s depreciation and amortization margin increased 0.1 point to 3.1% in 2014 compared to 3.0% in 2013.
The Company had net income of $137.7 million in 2014 compared to $123.3 million in 2013, an 11.6% increase. Net profit margin improved
to 9.8% in 2014 from 9.2% in 2013.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December
31, 2014 were $1.412 billion, an increase of $74.2 million or 5.5% from 2013 revenues of $1.337 billion. Commercial pest control
represented approximately 41% of the Company’s business in 2014 and grew 6.7% in 2014 due to increases in sales and bed bug
revenues and acquisitions. Residential pest control represented approximately 41% of the Company’s business and increased
4.5% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing as well as increased capture of TAEXX® homebuilder installations, bed bug
revenues and acquisitions. The Company’s termite business, which represented approximately 17% of the Company’s revenue,
grew 5.0% in 2014 due to increases in ancillary service sales as well as increases in customers from cross-selling campaigns, and
acquisitions.

The Company implemented its traditional price
increase program in June 2014. Less than 2.0% of the Company’s revenue increase came from pricing actions. The Company’s
acquisitions accounted for less than 2% of the revenue increase. Nearly 80.0% of the Company’s revenue was recurring in 2014
and 2013.

The Company’s foreign operations
accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The Company established new franchises
in Brazil, China, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Puerto Rico Saudi Arabia, Uruguay, and the US Virgin Islands in
2014 for a total of 37 international franchises at December 31, 2014 with 26 at December 31, 2013. Orkin had 92 and 80 total domestic
and international franchises at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December
31, 2014 cost of services provided increased $29.3 million or 4.3%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Gross
margin for the year increased to 49.9% for 2014 compared to 49.3% for 2013 due to favorable termite and casualty claim development,
reduced fleet costs and good cost controls across most spending categories.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014,
depreciation and amortization increased $3.9 million, or 10.0% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The increase
is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in late 2013 and early 2014 partially offset by several fixed and intangible
assets being fully depreciated or amortized.

Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December
31, 2014, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $13.4 million, or 3.1% compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2013 representing 31.3% of revenues compared to 32.0% of revenues in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues,
SG&A decreased due to the Company being able to leverage our administrative and sales salaries against higher revenues, along
with a lower advertising run rate than the prior year.

Gain on Sales of assets, Net

Gain on sales of assets, net increased
to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.2 million gain in 2013. The Company recognized gains from the
sale of owned vehicles and property in 2014 and 2013.

Interest (Income)/Expense, Net

Interest (income)/expense, net for the
year ended December 31, 2014 was $0.3 million income, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to $0.4 million in 2013. Interest income
for the year is due to interest received on cash balances in the Company’s various cash accounts.

Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate increased
to 37.3% in 2014 compared to 35.6% in 2013, due primarily to state and foreign income taxes, and the release of certain deferred
tax liabilities in 2013.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Flow

Cash from operating activities is the
principal source of cash generation for our businesses.

The most significant source of cash
in Rollins’ cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from
services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a
wide range of material and services.

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents
at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $134.6 million, $108.4 million, and $118.2 million, respectively.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

The Company’s operations generated
cash of $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily from net income of $152.1 million, compared with cash provided
by operating activities of $194.1 million in 2014 and $162.7 million in 2013. The Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents
balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities and available borrowings under its $175.0 million
credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the
foreseeable future.

The Company made contributions totaling
$5.0 million to the Rollins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ defined benefit retirement plans (the “Plans”)
during the year ended December 31, 2015 and $5.3 million and $5.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively,
as a result of the Plans’ funding status. The Company is considering making contributions to its Plans of approximately $3.3
million during fiscal year 2016. In the opinion of management, additional Plan contributions will not have a material effect on
the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

The Company used $69.9 million on investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $89.5 million and $30.8 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively,
and of that, invested approximately $39.5 million in capital expenditures during 2015 compared to $28.7 million and $18.6 million
during 2014 and 2013, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements
and technology related projects. The Company expects to invest between $20.0 million and $25.0 million in 2016 in capital expenditures.
During 2015, the Company’s subsidiaries acquired several small companies totaling $33.5 million compared to $63.3 million
in acquisitions during 2014 and $12.6 million in 2013. The expenditures for the Company’s acquisitions were funded with cash
on hand and stock in one instance. The Company continues to seek new acquisitions.

Cash Used in Financing
Activities

The Company used cash of $97.2 million
on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $106.5 million and $75.7 million during 2014 and 2013,
respectively. A total of $91.8 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.42 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2015 including
a special dividend paid in December 2015 of $0.10 per share, compared to $75.8 million paid in cash dividends ($0.35 per share)
during the year ended December 31, 2014, including a special dividend paid in December 2014 of $0.07 per share and $65.7 million
($0.30 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2013, including a special dividend paid in December 2013 of $0.06 per share.

The Company used $0.4 million to repurchase
on the open market 19 thousand shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $22.42 per share during 2015 compared
to $29.3 million to purchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $19.46 in 2014 and $8.4 million to purchase 0.5 million
shares at a weighted average price of $16.37 in 2013. There remain 5.9 million shares authorized to be repurchased under prior
Board approval. In addition to the shares purchased on the open market, the Company repurchased $7.0 million, $6.2 million and
$5.3 million of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from employees for the payment
of taxes on vesting restricted shares.

The Company’s $134.6 million of
total cash at December 31, 2015, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $34.8 million is held in
cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $99.8 million is primarily held in Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may exceed federally
insured amounts.


The Company’s international business
is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits
and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries
is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The Company maintains a large cash position
in the United States while having no third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without
regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic
business.

On October 31, 2012, the Company entered
into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0
million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. The Credit Agreement
was amended on October 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2018 and add three optional one year extensions. On
October 27, 2015 the Company exercised a one year extension option to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2019. As of December
31, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately
$31.4 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company’s fronting insurance companies and/or
certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured status, to secure various workers’ compensation and casualty insurance
contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate
such claims.

The Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed
by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2019, subject to up
to two optional extensions of the Credit Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear
interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company’s election:

·

the Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum
rate which the Administrative Agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company views critical accounting
policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and
that require management’s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult
or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe
our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The
Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor
and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include
termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent
years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant
claims. Accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.

Accrued Insurance—

The
Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’ compensation and vehicle
liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical
trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future
periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent third
party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The
actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in business
practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of
factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication
of future events. The Company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims.
Initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its
drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing, increased driver training
and a nurse triage program for employees.

Revenue Recognition—

The
Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain
revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting
estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly
or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general,
pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest
control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers
recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the discounts
related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite baiting revenues are recognized
based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality
control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed
liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered
monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results
in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase
price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional
items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract
period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Revenue received for conventional termite
renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is
made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance
of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number
of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The
Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to
be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

All revenues are reported net of sales
taxes.

Contingency Accruals

—The
Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined
in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments
concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary
from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material
adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other
current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.


Defined benefit pension plans

— In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit plan, although the
Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005. The Company also includes the Waltham Services,
LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan to the Company’s financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined benefit plans
in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715

“Compensation- Retirement Benefits”

, and engages an outside actuary
to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used
on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments
to these liabilities as necessary.

The Company chooses an expected rate of return
on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views
of our investment adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized
over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense. The Company’s
assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from the prior year.

The discount rate reflects the current rate
at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes
a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company’s expected benefit payments over the
life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit
payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over
the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. The discount rate was
4.7% as of December 31, 2015 compared to 4.15% in 2014 and 5.2% in 2013. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit
obligation.

As set forth in note 13 to the Company’s
financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan’s investments are real estate, tactical composite
and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These investments are categorized as level
3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance
with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-12 “

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset
Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),”

these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated
by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove
to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks
by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the
funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

As of December 31, 2015, the defined benefit
plans were under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity
by $14.8 million before tax and $9.1 million after tax.

New Accounting Standards

Recently adopted accounting
standards

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07
(“ASU 2015-07”) regarding ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement: Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities
That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).” The amendments in ASU 2015-07 remove the requirement to categorize
within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical
expedient. The amendments also limit certain disclosures to investments for which the entity has elected to measure at fair value
using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments in ASU 2015-07 are effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported
results of operations or financial position.

In June 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-10,
Technical Corrections and Improvements. ASU 2015-10 makes minor adjustments to the FASB Accounting Standard Codification. The technical
corrections are divided into four main categories: Amendments to align codification wording with that in pre-Codification standards,
corrections to references and clarification of guidance to avoid misapplication and misinterpretation, minor edits to simplify
the codification and thereby improve its usefulness and minor enhancements to codification guidance that are not expected to have
a significant effect on current practice. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after
December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard
did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-16 (Topic 805): Business Combinations. ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts
that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments
in this update require that the acquirer record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes
in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated
as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this update require an entity to present separately
on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line
item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized
as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this update were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional
amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have
not been issued. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations
or financial position.


Recently issued accounting standards
to be adopted in 2016 or later

In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP
when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a revised effective date
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, although not prior to fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition
method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We have not yet selected a transition method and continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
(Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 for all entities by
one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance
in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that
reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities also may apply the
guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and 2 interim reporting
periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies
the guidance in Update 2014-09. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results
of operations or financial position.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No (ASU)
2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present
a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying
component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. The amendments
in this update are effective for the company’s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted for all entities
as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively
to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. If an entity applies the guidance prospectively,
the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of change, the nature of and reason for the change in accounting
principle and a statement that prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. If an entity applies the guidance retrospectively,
the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of change the nature of and reason for the change in accounting
principle and quantitative information about the effects of the accounting change on prior periods. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact
on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include
statements regarding management’s belief that environmental remediation costs estimated to be incurred are not material to
the Company’s financial condition or operating results; management’s belief in the adequacy of the Company’s
facilities to meet its future needs; the outcome of litigation, as discussed in the Legal Proceedings section and elsewhere, and
the Company’s belief that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity; the Company’s expectation to continue its payment of cash dividends; expectations regarding
implementation and roll out of our CRM system; expectations regarding expansion of our domestic and international franchise footprint;
plans regarding acquisitions; the adequacy of the Company’s resources and borrowings to fund operations and obligations;
management’s belief that any additional pension plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company’s
financial position, results of operation or liquidity; the Company’s projected 2016 capital expenditures; the plans to grow
the business in foreign markets through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings and through acquisitions of unrelated
companies; the Company’s expectation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in its Revolving Credit Agreement
throughout 2016; the impact and amount of the Company’s contractual obligations; management’s expectations regarding
termite claims and factors that impact future costs from those claims; the expected cost of termite renewals; the expected collectability
of accounts receivable; expected tax consequences; expectations and plans regarding any losses from franchisees; the impact of
recent accounting pronouncements; and interest rate risks and foreign exchange currency risk on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations and liquidity. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking
statements because of various risks, timing and uncertainties including, without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling
against the Company in pending litigation; general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or technologies;
the degree of success of the Company’s termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods; the Company’s
ability to identify potential acquisitions; climate and weather trends; competitive factors and pricing practices; potential increases
in labor costs; and changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. All of the foregoing
risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks
and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.


Item 7.A.       Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market Risk

The Company maintains an investment portfolio
subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company is also subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings
on its $175 million credit facility. Currently, the Company has no outstanding borrowings. However, the Company does maintain approximately
$31.4 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material effect upon the Company’s results of operations
or financial position going forward.


MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL
CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The management of Rollins, Inc. is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Rollins, Inc. maintains a
system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded
against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The internal control system is augmented
by written policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel. This system
includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2015 based on criteria
established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management’s assessment is that Rollins, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.

The independent registered public accounting
firm, Grant Thornton LLP has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, and
has also issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, included in
this report on page 25.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Board of Directors and Stockholders’

Rollins, Inc.

We have audited the internal control
over financial reporting of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2015, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established
in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the
Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE

Board of Directors and Stockholders’

Rollins, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial position of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. Our audits of the basic consolidated financial statements
included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)2. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rollins, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed
an unqualified opinion.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business Description

—Rollins,
Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting,
Inc.

The Company is an international service
company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries
to both residential and commercial customers in North America with international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean,
the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that specifies
service frequency and the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, LLC. (“Orkin”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite control company. It provides
customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin serves customers, directly or through franchise operations, in the United States,
Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico providing essential
pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food
service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the Orkin

®

,
and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes
Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand name provides similar brand
recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada’s largest pest control provider and a leader in the
development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western Pest Services (“Western”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial
pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers focusing on the northeastern United
States.

The Industrial Fumigant Company (“IFC”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest
management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam Pest Defense (“HomeTeam”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition,
HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx

®

tubes in the wall pest control system, was recognized as a premier pest control
business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders nationally.

Rollins Australia (“Rollins Australia”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”), in February 2014. Allpest was established
in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional residential, commercial and termite service as well
as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity program and provides specialized services
to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.

Rollins Wildlife Services, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, acquired Critter Control February 27, 2015. Critter Control was established by Kevin Clark in 1983 and
is headquartered in Traverse City, Michigan. The business is currently 100% franchised with operations in 40 states and 2 Canadian
provinces.

The Company has several smaller wholly-owned
subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The Company has only one reportable
segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, includes the
United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and
Mexico. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer, few customers
or foreign operations.

Principles of Consolidation

—
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Rollins, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries and
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The Company does
not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership interest of 50% or less. The Company
is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly,
the Company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. The Company reclassified certain prior period amounts, none of which
were material, to conform to the current period presentation. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Subsequent Events

—The
Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. As of filing date, February 24,
2016, there were no subsequent events that would affect the Company’s financial statements.


Estimates Used in the Preparation
of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

—
The Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain
revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting
estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly
or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general,
pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest
control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers
recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the discounts
related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite baiting revenues are recognized
based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality
control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed
liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered
monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results
in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase
price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional
items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract
period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Revenue received for conventional termite
renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is
made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance
of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number
of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The
Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to
be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

All revenues are reported net of sales
taxes.

The Company’s foreign operations
accounted for approximately 7% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and 8% for the years ended December 2014, and
2013. Currency exchange translation is the cause of the decreased percentage.

Interest income on installment receivables
is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. Recognition of initial franchise fee revenues occurs
when all material services or conditions relating to a new agreement have been substantially performed or satisfied by the Company,
and initial franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial Position until such time. Royalties from
franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis. Gains on sales of pest control customer accounts
to franchises are recognized at the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable.  Management
uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectability of accounts
receivable.  Substantially all of the Company’s receivables are due from pest control and termite services in the United
States and selected international locations.  The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination
of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The Company’s established credit evaluation
procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. Provisions for doubtful accounts are
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts
when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected.
Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful
accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. There were no large recoveries in 2015, 2014, and 2013.  We record
specific provisions when we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the
case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position. If circumstances related
to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.

costs are charged to sales, general and administrative expense during the year in which they are incurred.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—
The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.

The Company’s $134.6 million of
total cash at December 31, 2015, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $34.8 million is held in
cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $99.8 million is primarily held in Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may exceed federally
insured amounts.

The Company’s international business
is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits
and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries
is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The Company maintains a large cash position
in the United States while having no third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without
regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic
business for the foreseeable future.

Marketable Securities

—
From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company’s
investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than “investment grade” by national rating
services.

Management determines the appropriate
classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. Debt
securities are classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity.
Available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary
on available-for-sale securities are included as a component of interest income.

The Company had no marketable securities
other than those held in the defined benefit pension plan and the nonqualified deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2015
and 2014. See note 13 for further details.

Materials and Supplies

—Materials
and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Income
Taxes

-The Company provides for income taxes based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codification topic 740 “Income Taxes”, which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
The Company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred
tax assets will not be utilized. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax
positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold

.

The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in
income tax expense.

Equipment and Property

—Equipment
and Property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are computed using the following asset lives:
buildings, ten to forty years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, two to ten years. Expenditures for additions,
major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost
of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts
in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. The annual provisions for depreciation,
below, have been reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets -

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 350,

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”

, the Company
classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible
assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. The Company does not amortize intangible assets with
indefinite lives and goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic downturn
or a change in the assessment of future operations. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the Company level. Such
impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with its carrying
value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, then the Company will compare the implied fair
value of goodwill to its carrying value. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than
its carrying value.  The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value
of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset’s
carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its most recent annual impairment analyses as of September
30, 2015. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or intangible
assets with indefinite lives was indicated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
-

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 360,

“Property, Plant and Equipment”

, the Company’s long-lived
assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment
charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. We periodically
evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including customer contracts and assets
that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Insurance

—The Company
self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’ compensation and vehicle liability.
The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as
incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods)
and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent third party
actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial
study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice
and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors
are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication
of future events.

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The
Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor
and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future costs include
termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent
years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant
claims. An accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.

Contingency Accruals

—The
Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with the FASB
ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with
the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately
predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation
are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management,
the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.

Three-for-two stock split

-The
Board of Directors at its quarterly meeting on January 27, 2015, authorized a three-for-two stock split by the issuance on March
10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at February 10, 2015. All share and per share
data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are restated for the three-for-two stock split.


Earnings Per Share -

the FASB
ASC Topic 260-10

“Earnings Per Share- Overall,”

requires a basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per
share presentation. Further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends
or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is required to include participating
securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.

The Company has periodically issued share-based
payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. See note
14 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.

The basic and diluted calculations are the
same as there were no stock options included in diluted earnings per share as we have no stock options outstanding. Basic and diluted
earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective
periods.

A reconciliation of weighted average shares
outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common stock (participating securities) is as
follows (in thousands except per share data). All share and per share information in the following chart are restated for the stock
split effective March 10, 2015:

Translation of Foreign Currencies

—Assets
and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end rate
of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as
those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign currency are included in the earnings of
the current period.

Stock-Based Compensation

—
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718 “

Compensation –
Stock Compensation

.” Time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees
under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan.

TLRSs provide for the issuance of a
share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years
from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. Outstanding TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second
anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and
retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded
may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed. The fair value of these awards
is recognized as compensation expense, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

—Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss) results from foreign currency translations and minimum pension liability adjustments.

Franchising
Program

– Rollins’ wholly-owned subsidiary,

Orkin, had 51, 55 and 54 domestic franchises as of December
31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Transactions with Orkin’s domestic franchises involve sales of customer contracts
to establish new Orkin franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts and initial Orkin franchise fees
are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods ranging up to five years. Notes receivable from Orkin franchises
were $4.8 million at December 31, 2015 and $4.2 million at December 31, 2014. These amounts are included as financing receivables
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

All domestic franchises have a guaranteed
repurchase clause that the Orkin franchise may be repurchased by Orkin at a later date once it has been established; therefore,
initial Orkin domestic franchise fees are deferred in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,”
for the duration of the initial contract period and are included as unearned revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position. Deferred Orkin franchise fees were $2.9 million, $3.0 million, and $2.9 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013,
respectively.

Royalties from Orkin franchises are accrued
and recognized in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,” as revenues are
earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from Orkin franchises was $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $4.5 million
and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Orkin
had 48, 37, and 26 international franchises, respectively. Orkin’s international franchise program began with its first international
franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean,
Europe, Africa and Mexico.

The Company’s maximum exposure
to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to the Orkin franchises was $1.9 million, $1.2
million, and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Rollins’
wholly-owned subsidiary,

Rollins Wildlife Services, had 108 Critter Control franchises in the United States and Canada as
of December 31, 2015. Transactions with Critter Control franchises involve sales of territories to establish new franchises, initial
franchise fees and royalties. The territories and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes.
Notes receivable from franchises were $0.4 million at December 31, 2015. These notes are not guaranteed.  The Company anticipates
that should there be any losses from franchisees these losses would be recouped by removing the individual franchisee and re-selling
the abandoned territory. These amounts are included as financing receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position.

Royalties from franchises are accrued and
recognized in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,” as revenues are earned
on a monthly basis.


New Accounting
Standards

Recently adopted accounting standards

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07
(“ASU 2015-07”) regarding ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement: Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities
That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).” The amendments in ASU 2015-07 remove the requirement to categorize
within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical
expedient. The amendments also limit certain disclosures to investments for which the entity has elected to measure at fair value
using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments in ASU 2015-07 are effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported
results of operations or financial position.

In June 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-10,
Technical Corrections and Improvements. ASU 2015-10 makes minor adjustments to the FASB Accounting Standard Codification. The technical
corrections are divided into four main categories: Amendments to align codification wording with that in pre-Codification standards,
corrections to references and clarification of guidance to avoid misapplication and misinterpretation, minor edits to simplify
the codification and thereby improve its usefulness and minor enhancements to codification guidance that are not expected to have
a significant effect on current practice. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after
December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard
did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-16 (Topic 805): Business Combinations. ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts
that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments
in this update require that the acquirer record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes
in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated
as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this update require an entity to present separately
on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line
item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized
as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this update were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional
amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have
not been issued. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations
or financial position.

Recently
issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2016 or later

In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP
when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a revised effective date
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, although not prior to fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition
method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We have not yet selected a transition method and continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.
We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
(Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 for all entities by
one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance
in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that
reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities also may apply the
guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and 2 interim reporting
periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies
the guidance in Update 2014-09. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results
of operations or financial position.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No (ASU)
2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present
a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying
component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. The amendments
in this update are effective for the company’s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted for all entities
as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively
to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. If an entity applies the guidance prospectively,
the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of change, the nature of and reason for the change in accounting
principle and a statement that prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. If an entity applies the guidance retrospectively,
the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of change the nature of and reason for the change in accounting
principle and quantitative information about the effects of the accounting change on prior periods. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact
on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

ACQUISITIONS

The Company has made 12, 12, and 21 acquisitions
that are not material individually or in total to the Company’s consolidated financial statements during the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  The largest acquisitions made during these periods are as follows:

The Company completed its acquisition of Critter
Control on February 27, 2015. Critter Control was established by Kevin Clark in 1983 and is headquartered in Traverse City, Michigan.
The business is currently 100% franchised, operating in 40 states and 2 Canadian provinces.

Rollins Australia, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”), in February 2014. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered
in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional commercial, residential, and termite service as well as consulting services on
border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity program and provides specialized services to Australia’s mining
and oil and gas sectors.

Acquisition of Wilco Enterprises, Inc. (sole
holder of PermaTreat Exterminating Company, Inc. d/b/a PermaTreat Pest Control, Inc.) (“PermaTreat”) – The Company
completed the acquisition of PermaTreat effective August 1, 2014. PermaTreat is a leading pest control company located in Central
and Northern Virginia and was founded in 1967. The Company issued 873,349 shares of its $1 par value common stock valued
at $18.79 per share to Joseph R. Wilson and Jack Broome.

Total cash purchase price for the Company’s
acquisitions in 2015 and 2014 were $33.5 million and $63.3 million, respectively.

DEBT

On October 31, 2012, the Company entered
into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0
million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. The Credit Agreement
was amended on October 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2018 and add three optional one year extensions. On
October 27, 2015 the Company exercised a one year extension option to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2019. As of December
31, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately
$31.4 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company’s fronting insurance companies and/or
certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured status, to secure various workers’ compensation and casualty insurance
contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate
such claims.


The Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed
by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2019, subject to up
to two optional extensions of the Credit Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear
interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company’s election:

·

the Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum
rate which the Administrative Agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve
percentages established by the U.S. Federal Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month,

plus

1.0% per annum.

·

with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate
plus an additional amount, which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon Rollins’ then-current debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As
of December 31, 2015, the additional rate allocated was .75%.

The Revolving Credit Agreement contains
customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the
Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its
assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants restricting the Company’s
ability to permit the ratio of the Company’s consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The Company remained in compliance with
applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2015 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2016.

TRADE RECEIVABLES

The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency aging totals, based on contractual
terms, for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company policies that are specific to
pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

Rollins manages its financing receivables
on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. The Company’s credit risk is generally low with a large
number of entities comprising Rollins’ customer base and dispersion across many different geographical regions. The credit
quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an assessment of the individual’s beacon/credit
bureau score. Rollins requires a potential obligor to have good credit worthiness with low risk before entering into a contract.
Depending upon the individual’s credit score the Company may accept with 100% financing or require a significant down payment
or turndown the contract. Delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. Financing receivables include installment receivable
amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.

$

Total financing receivables, net were
$27.5 million and $24.0 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Financing receivables are generally charged-off
when deemed uncollectable or when 180 days have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment. The Company’s
charge-off policy has been consistently applied during the periods reported. Management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating
the appropriateness of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Gross charge-offs as a percentage of average financing receivables
were 3.0% and 3.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Due to the low percentage
of charge-off receivables and the high credit worthiness of the potential obligor, the entire Rollins, Inc. financing receivables
portfolio has a low credit risk.


The Company offers 90 days same-as-cash
financing to some customers based on their credit worthiness. Interest is not recognized until the 91st day at which time it is
recognized retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. In certain circumstances, such as when
delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest when they reach 180 days past due.

The repurchase of Orkin domestic franchises
is guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, Inc. Included in financing receivables are notes receivable
from Orkin franchise owners. The majority of these notes are low risk as the repurchase price of the Orkin franchise is currently
estimated and has historically been well above the receivable due from the Orkin franchise owner. Also included in notes receivables
are franchise notes from other brands which are not guaranteed.

The carrying amount of notes receivable
approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of contracts. Long-Term Installment receivables,
net were $13.6 million and $11.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Rollins establishes an allowance for
doubtful accounts to insure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The allowance balance is comprised
of a general reserve, which is determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance, and a specific reserve, which
is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy or other events, that make
it unlikely that Rollins will recover its investment. The general reserve percentages are based on several factors, which include
consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio
and information derived from competitive benchmarking.

Rollins’
wholly-owned subsidiary,

Rollins Wildlife Services, had 108 Critter Control franchises in the United States and Canada as
of December 31, 2015. Transactions with franchises involve sales of territories to establish new franchises, initial franchise
fees and royalties. The territories and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes. Notes receivable
from franchises were $0.4 million at December 31, 2015. These notes are not guaranteed.  The Company anticipates that should
there be any losses from franchisees these losses would be recouped by removing the individual franchisee and re-selling the abandoned
territory. These amounts are included as financing receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Royalties from franchises are accrued and
recognized in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,” as revenues are earned
on a monthly basis.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company’s financial instruments
consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable, and other short-term
liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values. The Company has financial instruments
related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed in note 13.

The fair value hierarchy has three levels
based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and
Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.

The following table presents our nonqualified
deferred compensation plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2015.

At December 31, 2015 the Deferred Compensation
Plan had 70 life insurance policies with a net face value of $42.2 million. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies
had a net realizable value of $12.9 million and $12.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total deferred compensation
plan assets, recorded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position, were $14.0 million
and $13.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill was $249.9 million as
of December 31, 2015 and $255.6 million as of December 31, 2014. Goodwill decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily
to currency conversion of foreign goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill in foreign countries was $36.9 million as of December
31, 2015 and $42.7 million as of December 31, 2014. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended

CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Customer contracts are amortized on
a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio that current revenues bear
to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”,

the expected lives of customer contracts were reviewed, and it was determined
that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of 7 to 20 years dependent upon customer type. The carrying amount and
accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:

The Provision for Income Taxes resulted in
an effective tax rate of 37.4% on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effective rate differs from
the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes.

For 2014 and 2013 the effective tax rate was
37.3% and 35.6%, respectively. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because
of state and foreign income taxes and the release of certain deferred tax liabilities.

During 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company paid
income taxes of $82.7 million, $74.5 million and $69.4 million, respectively, net of refunds.


Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 and

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has net
operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately $188.4 million, which will be available
to offset future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2016 and 2029. Management believes that it
is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $18.0 million of foreign net operating losses before they expire and has included
a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance increased by $0.6
million due to the foreign net operating losses.

Earnings from continuing operations before
income tax includes foreign income of $17.0 million, $16.2 million, and $17.0 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The
Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through
reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisition of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the
Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not part of the Company’s current business plan.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
at December 31, 2015 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $0.0 million. A reconciliation of the beginning
and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject
to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries
in various state and international jurisdictions that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2007 through 2013. With
few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years prior
to 2011.

It is reasonably possible that the amount
of unrecognized tax benefits will increase in the next 12 months.

The Company’s policy is to record interest
and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $0.9 million and $0.5 million
as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties of $0.2 million, $0.1
million, and $0.9 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

ACCRUAL FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of
reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services.
Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

In the normal course of business, certain
of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations which allege that the subsidiaries’
services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases and claims from time to time. We are involved
in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. We are actively contesting each of these matters.

The Company and a subsidiary, The Industrial
Fumigant Company, LLC, were named defendants in

Severn Peanut Co. and Meherrin Agriculture & Chemical Co. v. Industrial
Fumigant Co., et al.

The

Severn

lawsuit, a matter related to a fumigation service, was filed in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  The trial court dismissed all of Plaintiffs’ claims in 2014;
and the court of appeals affirmed the rulings in December, 2015.

On December 2, 2014, Plaintiff Killian Pest
Control sued Rollins, Inc., its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense, and alleged that HomeTeam’s exclusive use of its “tubes
in the walls” system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, and California’s Cartwright Act and Business and Professions
Code. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the Sherman and Cartwright Acts, and the Business
and Professions Code; a permanent injunction against continuing alleged violations; and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending
in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. The Company cannot currently estimate the reasonably possible
loss, if any, because the lawsuit is at an early stage and involves unresolved issues of law and fact. The Company intends to defend
this matter vigorously.

On December 2, 2014, Plaintiff Jose Luis Garnica,
on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated customers, sued Rollins, Inc., its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense, and
alleged that HomeTeam’s exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust
Act. The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the Sherman Act; a permanent injunction against
continuing violations; and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California.
The Company cannot currently estimate the reasonably possible loss, if any, because the lawsuit is at an early stage and involves
unresolved issues of law and fact. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.


Management does not believe that any pending
claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters,
however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

13.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan

The Company maintains several noncontributory
tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”) covering employees meeting certain age and service requirements.
The Plans provide benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five years during the last ten years of credited service
(as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated Social Security covered earnings. The Company funds
the Plans with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company made contributions of $5.0 million, $5.3 million and
$5.0 million to the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively.

In 2005, the Company ceased all future
benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits
earned through June 2005.  In 2014, the Plan was amended to allow certain vested participants the ability to elect for
a limited time the commencement of their benefit in the form of a single-sum payment, not to exceed $22,000, or an annuity starting
date of December 1, 2014.  In total $6.3 million was paid by the Plan during the year ended December 31, 2014, under this
program.  The Plan did not offer any options for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013.

The Company includes the Waltham Services,
LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan in the Company’s financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined benefit plans
in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation- Retirement Benefits”, and engages an outside actuary to calculate
its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic
basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these
liabilities as necessary.


In June 2005, the Company froze the Rollins,
Inc. defined benefit pension plan. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for its defined benefit
post-retirement plans. The funded status of the Plans and the net amount recognized in the statement of financial position are
summarized as follows as of:

benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the same for the Plans. Pre-tax (increases)/decreases in the
pension liability which were (charged, net of tax) credited to other comprehensive income/ (loss) were $14.8 million, $(41.7) million,
and $45.7 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

The return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average
of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in the plan. The expected long-term rate
of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.

The discount rate reflects the current rate
at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year.  In estimating this rate, for fiscal
year’s 2015, 2014, and 2013 the Company utilized a yield curve analysis.

The Company expects to amortize a net loss
of $3.0 million in 2016. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Plan’s assets were comprised of listed common stocks and U.S.
government and corporate securities, real estate and other. Included in the assets of the Plan were shares of Rollins, Inc. Common
Stock with a market value of $40.5 million and $37.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The Plans’ weighted average asset allocation

For each of the asset categories in the pension
plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level
of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The investment policy establishes a target allocation
for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including individual
market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this
target allocation. The Company and management are considering making contributions to the pension plans of approximately $3.3 million
during fiscal 2016.

Some of our assets, primarily our private
equity

,

real estate, and hedge funds, do not have readily determinable market values given
the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments.  For the December 31, 2015
plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible.  For assets without readily determinable values,
estimates were derived from investment manager statements combined with

discussions focusing
on underlying fundamentals and significant events.

Additionally, these investments are
categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable
fair value.  In accordance with ASU No. 2011-12 “Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per
Share (Or Its Equivalent),” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in
which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect,
resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating
the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’
financial statements for reasonableness

.


Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s overall investment strategy
is to achieve a mix of approximately 70 percent of investments for long-term growth and 30 percent for near-term benefit payments,
with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers.  Equity securities primarily include investments
in large-cap and small-cap companies

domiciled domestically and

internationally.  Fixed-income securities include corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities,

sovereign bonds

,

and U.S. Treasuries.  Other types of investments include real
estate

funds and private equity funds that follow several different investment strategies.
For each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate
of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The
investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required.  The plans utilize
a number of investment approaches, including

but not limited to

individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt
funds to achieve this target allocation.

Defined Contribution 401(k) Savings Plan

The Company sponsors a defined contribution
401(k) Savings Plan that is available to a majority of the Company’s full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter
following completion of three months of service. The Plan is available to non full-time employees the first day of the calendar
quarter following one year of service upon completion of 1,000 hours in that year.  The Plan provides for a matching contribution
of fifty cents ($.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant’s contributions to the Plan that do not exceed 6 percent
of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). The charge to expense for the Company match
was approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $8.5 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December
31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 approximately, 33.5%, 29.3%, and 34.9%, respectively of the
plan assets consisted of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total administrative fees paid by the Company for the Plan were less than
$0.1 million each of the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan

The Deferred Compensation Plan provides that
participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual bonus with respect to any given plan year,
subject to a $2 thousand per plan year minimum. The Company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts. The Company
credited accounts of participants of long service to the Company with certain discretionary amounts (“Pension Plan Benefit
Restoration Contributions”) in lieu of benefits that previously accrued under the Company’s Retirement Income Plan up to
a maximum of $245 thousand.

Accounts will be credited with hypothetical
earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain “Measurement Funds.” Account values
are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and Company credits had been converted into shares or other ownership units of selected
Measurement Funds by purchasing (or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current purchase price of the relevant
Measurement Fund at the time of the participant’s selection. Deferred Compensation Plan benefits are unsecured general obligations
of the Company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness. The Company has established a “rabbi trust,” which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to indirectly
fund any obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the extent that the Company’s obligations under the Deferred Compensation
Plan exceed assets available under the trust, the Company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability
under the Deferred Compensation Plan.


Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan
provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant’s death, disability, retirement
or other termination of employment (a “Termination Event”). However, for any deferrals of salary and bonus (but not Company
contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a Termination Event. Generally,
the Deferred Compensation Plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan in installments
or lump-sum payments.

At December 31, 2015 the Deferred Compensation
Plan had 70 life insurance policies with a net face value of $42.2 million. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies
were worth $12.9 million and $12.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The estimated life insurance premium payments

on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position and $14.1 million and $13.7 million in deferred compensation
liability as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, located within long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock Compensation Plans

Stock options and time lapse restricted
shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan.

Stock Options

The Company’s stock options generally
vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively,
the Company did not issue any shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees.

In order to estimate the fair value
of stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require
the input of highly subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time.


Option activity under the Company’s
stock option plan as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2015 were as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the
table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the
last trading day of the year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that day. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will
change based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock.

There were
no options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during
the year ended December 31, 2013 was

$0.1 million. Exercise of options during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted
in cash receipts of less than $10 thousand.

Time Lapse Restricted Shares and
Restricted Stock Units

TLRSs provide for the issuance of a
share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years
from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary
of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting
rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be
sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

The Company issued time lapse restricted
shares of 0.7 million, 0.6 million, and 0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

The Company issues new shares from its
authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2015, approximately 5.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock
were reserved for issuance. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718, “

Compensation – Stock Compensation,”

the Company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company
estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.
