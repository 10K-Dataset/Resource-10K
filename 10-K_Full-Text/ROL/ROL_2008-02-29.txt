PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is a national service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and
commercial customers in North America with international franchises in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia. Services are performed through a contract that specifies the
pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, Inc.
("Orkin"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is one of the world's largest pest and termite control companies. It provides customized services from over 400
locations to approximately 1.7 million customers. Orkin serves customers, either directly or indirectly through franchises, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean,
the Middle East and Asia providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments,
food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the Orkin®, and PCO Services, Inc.® trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service
mark. The Orkin® brand
name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The PCO Services brand name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

PCO
Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Orkin's founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. PCO Services is the largest pest control service provider in Canada.

Western
Pest Services ("Western"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service
company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers focusing on the northeastern United States.

The
Industrial Fumigant Company ("IFC"), another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937 was, acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and
sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, which includes the United States, Canada,
Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia are included in Item 8 of this document, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" on pages 39 and 40. The Company's
results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company's foreign operations.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

In 2007, total share repurchases were 2.4 million shares adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective December 10, 2007. In total,
1.0 million additional (post-split) shares may be purchased under previously approved programs by the Board of Directors. The program does not have an expiration date.

Backlog

Backlog services and orders are usually provided within the month following the month of order receipt, except in the area of prepaid pest control and bait monitoring services,
which are usually provided within


twelve
months of order receipt. The Company does not have a material portion of its business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a
governmental entity.

Orkin Franchise

The Company continues to expand its growth through Orkin's franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently not economically feasible
to locate a conventional Orkin branch. The franchisee is subject to a contractual buyback provision at Orkin's option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to
revenues of the franchise. The Company through its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994, and established its first international franchise in Mexico in
2000, its second international franchise in Panama in 2003 and its third international franchise in Costa Rica in 2006. Orkin established four additional international franchises in 2007 with
additions in Honduras, the United Arab Emirates, the Dominican Republic and South Korea.

Total Franchises




Subsequently,
Orkin established two new international franchises in January 2008, one in the city of Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and one in the country of Qatar.

Seasonality

The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company's pest and termite control services. The increase in pest pressure and activity, as well as the
metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the
Company's pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The Company has relationships with multiple vendors for pest and termite control treatment products and maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies
to fulfill its immediate servicing needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers.


Competition

The Company believes that Rollins, through Orkin, Orkin's subsidiary PCO Services, Western Pest Services, and Industrial Fumigant Company, competes favorably with competitors
as one of the world's largest pest and termite control companies. The Company's competitors include Terminix, Ecolab and Rentokil.

The
principal methods of competition in the Company's pest and termite control business are quality of service and guarantees, including the money-back guarantee on pest and termite
control, and the termite re-treatment and damage repair guarantee to qualified homeowners.

Research and Development

Expenditures by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and improved service methods and
products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies. Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.

The
Company maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.

The
Company also conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products. The Company also works closely with industry consultants and suppliers to improve service and
establish new and innovative methods and procedures.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

The Company's pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment, public health and consumers.
Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act ("FIFRA")

This federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control companies operate. Each
state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the following: licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of
products. This allows each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens' wishes in each state. The pest control industry is
impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 ("FQPA")

The FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts its business.

Environmental Remediation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as Superfund, is the primary Federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive
hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of
hazardous substances, and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will work with the EPA and under the direction of the responsible
state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Consistent with the Company's responsibilities under these regulations, the


Company
undertakes environmental assessments and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these situations arise, the
Company accrues management's best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management's current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the
Company's financial condition or operating results.

Employees

The number of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2008 was approximately 8,500.

Commission.

Item 1.A.    Risk Factors

We may not be able to compete in the competitive and technical pest control industry in the future.

We
operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by the following factors: changes in competitive prices, weather related issues, general economic issues and
governmental regulations. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal
competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are product and service quality and availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe
that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent, we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.

We may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions have been and will continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable
acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business.
Any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

Our operations are directly affected by the weather conditions across the United States and Canada. The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the
Company's pest and termite control services. The increase in pest pressure and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the
timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company's pest and termite control operations during such periods. The business of the
Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods.


Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand our operations is in part
impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees is high, and the supply is very limited. A
significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events
occurred, our capacity and profitability could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

Our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.

In the normal course of business, Orkin, one of the Company's subsidiaries, is a defendant in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that plaintiffs have been
damaged as a result of the rendering of services by Orkin. Orkin is actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits have been filed (

Mark and Christine Butland
et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al.; Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc., et al

.;

John Maciel v. Orkin, Inc., et
al.

;

Ronald and Ileana Krzyzanowsky et
al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. and Rollins, Inc.

;

Adam Stauber v. Rollins, Inc.
et al.

; and

Roy Sheppard et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. and
Rollins, Inc.

) in which the plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class. The cases originate in Florida, Georgia, California, and Arkansas,
respectively. In

Butland

, pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa, Florida, the Court issued a ruling
certifying this as a class action, but Orkin appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals, which in June 2006 denied certification of the class. Following the Plaintiffs'
motion for rehearing, the court upheld its prior decision that class certification was improper but also ruled that the Plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower
class. Orkin will vigorously oppose any effort by the Plaintiffs to do so. In

Warren

, the Superior Court of Cobb County,
Marietta, Georgia, ruled in August 2006, certifying the class action against Orkin. Orkin appealed this ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals, which in November 2007 denied certification of the
class. Plaintiff appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court of Georgia, which in February 2008 denied Plaintiff's petition for review. The

Maciel

lawsuit, a wage and hour related matter, was filed
in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California and has
not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Krzyzanowsky

lawsuit, a termite service related matter, was filed
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Stauber

lawsuit, a Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
related matter, was filed in the United States District Court for the
Central District of California and a date has not been scheduled for a hearing on class certification. The

Sheppard

lawsuit, a termite related matter, was recently filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas and a date has not been scheduled for a hearing on class certification.
The Company believes these matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest certification and defend itself through trial, if necessary. The Company does not believe that any pending
claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some
or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter.

Our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of
enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings,
or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted. We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations. We also believe
that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. We


are
unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of
licenses, fines, and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.

The Company's Management Has a Substantial Ownership Interest; Public Stockholders May Have No Effective Voice In the Company's Management

The Company has elected the "Controlled Company" exemption under rule 303A of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Company Guide. The Company is a "Controlled Company"
because a group that includes the Company's Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins, his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, also a
director of the Company, certain companies under their control, and the nephew of R. Randall Rollins and son of Gary W. Rollins, Glen W. Rollins, who is the Vice President of Rollins, Inc.,
controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company's voting power. As a "Controlled Company," the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.

Rollins, Inc.'s
executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 59 percent of the Company's
outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate
transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from
acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Item 1.B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None

Item 2.    Properties.

The Company's administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The Company owns or leases over 400
branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins Training Center located in Atlanta, Georgia, the Orkin Customer Care Center located in Covington, GA, and the
Pacific Division Administration and Training Center in Riverside, CA. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important physical property of the Company. The
facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.

Orkin, one of the Company's subsidiaries, is a named defendant in

Mark and Christine Butland et al. v. Orkin Exterminating
Company, Inc. et al.

pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa, Florida. The plaintiffs filed suit in March of 1999 and are seeking
monetary damages and injunctive relief. The Court ruled in early April 2002, certifying the class action lawsuit against Orkin. Orkin appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court of
Appeals, which remanded the case back to the trial court for further findings. In December 2004 the Court issued a new ruling certifying the class action. Orkin appealed this new ruling to the Florida
Second District Court of Appeals. In June 2006, the Florida Second District Court of Appeals issued a ruling denying certification of the class. Following the Plaintiffs' motion for rehearing, the
court upheld its prior decision that class certification was improper but also ruled that the Plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower class. Orkin will vigorously
oppose any effort by the Plaintiffs to do so. Orkin believes this case to be without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously through trial, if necessary. At this time, the final outcome of the
litigation cannot be determined. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position; however,


it
is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter.

Additionally,
in the normal course of business, Orkin is a defendant in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services by
Orkin. Orkin is actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits have been filed (

Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating
Company, Inc., et al.; John Maciel v. Orkin, Inc., et al.

;

Ronald and Ileana Krzyzanowsky et al. v.
Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. and Rollins, Inc.

;

Adam Stauber v. Rollins, Inc.
et al.

; and

Roy Sheppard et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. and
Rollins, Inc.

) in which the Plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class. The cases originate in Georgia, California, and Arkansas, respectively. In

Warren

,
the Superior Court of Cobb County, Marietta, Georgia, ruled in August 2006, certifying the class action against
Orkin. Orkin appealed this ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals, which in November 2007 denied certification of the class. Plaintiff appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court of Georgia, which in
February 2008 denied Plaintiff's petition for review. The

Maciel

lawsuit, a wage and hour related matter, was filed in the
Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Krzyzanowsky

lawsuit, a termite service related matter, was filed in the United
States District Court for the Northern
District of California and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Stauber

lawsuit, a Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act related matter, was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and a date has not been scheduled for a hearing on class certification.
The

Sheppard

lawsuit, a termite related matter, was recently filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Arkansas and a date has not been scheduled for a hearing on class certification. The Company believes these matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest certification and
defend itself through trial or arbitration, if necessary. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the
results of an individual quarter.

Orkin
is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company's liability under any of these matters would not and
did not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

General Operating Comments

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company's financial results improved for the 10th consecutive year due to the positive revenue growth in all service
lines and the success of the Company's sales and marketing programs.

Revenues

The Company's strategy has been to increase our revenues through increased sales with a priority on commercial sales. The Company has increased its sales force and organic
growth. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company's revenues increased 4.2%. Commercial pest control now represents 44.0% of the Company's business which is an increase of 63.0% since
1998 when commercial pest control represented 27.0% of the Company's business. The Company increased the average new sale price by over 15%, which increased the average contract price for commercial
customers 23% over the past two years. The average monthly sales for Commercial account managers increased 34% in the last three years, which reflect the continued maturation of our sales force.

Residential
pest control, which now represents 36.9% of the Company's business, grew 3.8% from $316.8 million to $329.0 million, while our Termite Service, represents 19.3% of our
business. Conventional leads were down due to the extreme drought in much of the United States. The investment made in web marketing helped to offset the fall off, resulting in an increase in demand
for both residential and termite services late in the season that carried through until the end of 2007. Termite retention improved however sales remained flat.

Revenue
growth was enjoyed by all three lines of business and is attributable in part to the Company's national Orkin Customer Service Center, OCSC, which we established in 2006. Its role in part is
to receive and sell the majority of residential pest control leads and help manage branch handling of termite control leads. The Company expects the OCSC to contribute to growth in 2008 as Orkin
improves in both of these areas.


Web Development

During 2007, the Company continued to build upon the investment made in web marketing the previous year. This strategy is allowing Orkin to use its size and national branch
network to a competitive advantage. Orkin expects the number of prospects for both residential and commercial web leads to increase further in 2008. Orkin has engaged a new search agency, 360i, to
help make it easier for customers to access Orkin. Orkin has also engaged a new Yellow Pages agency to assist in improving marketing in this area, and to help find new customers and create more
efficiency from this channel in terms of producing a lower cost per customer attracted.

Advertising

The Company felt it needed to do a better job in communicating with prospects and be more effective in reaching Orkin's target audience. The Company determined that it needed
to improve how it advertises and promotes the Orkin brand in conventional media (radio, TV, Cable etc.). Accordingly, in 2007, the Company hired The Richards Group of Dallas, Texas as its agency of
record.

Technology

Orkin is continuing to make progress on its routing and scheduling management system, called ORION. Orkin expects to go live at several of branches early in the second half of
2008 and has begun planning a full implementation prior to December 31, 2008. Due to Orkin's size, it may take as much as two years for a complete rollout. Orkin is currently utilizing Map
Point software, an offshoot of their GPS system to begin the first phase of route organization. Part of this initiative involves refining and standardizing customer data, which likewise will be
a precursor to an ORION conversion.

Employees

Rollins continues to invest in its greatest asset, its people. During 2007 training became available to all employees in 350 locations via Orkin's Orkin TV satellite network.
Orkin was recognized for the sixth year in a row by Training Magazine as one of the top 125 companies that excel in human capital development. Orkin also launched its "Lifelong Learning" initiative
aimed at helping all field employees grow and develop throughout their careers. A top priority in 2008 is to identify specific "performance based" opportunities to help employees develop to their
highest potential.

Rollins, Inc.
In 2007 conducted its first annual Women's Leadership Conference. The Company subsequently formed a Women's Resource Group to further develop initiatives to both recruit more
women to Rollins and Orkin and to advance the careers of the females presently at the Company.

Three-for-Two Stock Split

On October 23, 2007, Rollins, Inc.'s Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of the Company's common shares. The
additional shares were distributed on December 10, 2007, to shareholders of record on November 12, 2007. All share, earnings per share, and dividends per share data presented throughout
this document, including the accompanying financial statements and management's discussion and analysis, have been adjusted to reflect this stock split.

On
January 25, 2005, Rollins, Inc.'s Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of the Company's common shares. The additional shares were
distributed on March 10, 2005 to all shareholders of record at February 10, 2005. All share, earnings per share, and dividends per share data, prior to this stock split, presented
throughout this document, including the accompanying financial statements and management's discussion and analysis, have been adjusted to reflect this stock split.


Results of Operations—2007 Versus 2006

Overview

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company had net income of $64.7 million compared to $57.8 million in 2006, which represents a 12.0% increase. In
addition to the revenue increase of 4.2%, Cost of Service Provided increased $10.8 million or 2.4% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Gross margin improved to
47.6% for 2007 versus 46.7% for 2006. The largest factor affecting the Company's gross margin was improvements in our cost of risk. The Company's termite
provision has decreased $5.8 million as actual termite claims paid in 2007 declined significantly, decreasing over 30% or $6.6 million. In addition our insurance costs have declined due
to the success of the Company's loss control programs.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $894.9 million, an increase of $36.0 million or 4.2% from 2006 revenues of $858.9 million. The
Company's commercial revenue grew 6.9%, due primarily to expanded sales force, better customer retention in Orkin's and Western Pest's operations, and strong growth at PCO, Orkin's Canadian business,
which is fundamentally a commercial business. Residential pest control revenues rose by 3.8% in 2007, due to an increased number of leads received, better average selling prices, continued
improvements in customer retention, and a successful price increase program. Every-other-month service, the Company's primary residential pest control service offering, now comprises 64% of our
residential pest control customer base at December 31, 2007. During 2007, the Company continued to build upon the investment made in the internet marketing area from previous year. This
strategy allowed the Company to use its size and national branch network to a competitive advantage. The Company expects the number of prospects for both residential and commercial web leads to
increase further in 2008.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 7.4% in 2006. The Company established new franchises in
Honduras, the United Arab Emirates, the Dominican Republic and South Korea in 2007 for a total of seven international franchises. At the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Orkin had 58
domestic and international franchises in total

Cost of Services Provided

Cost of services provided for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $10.8 million or 2.4% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Gross
margin improved to 47.6% for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus 46.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The largest factor was improvements in our cost of risk. The Company's
termite provision has decreased $5.8 million as actual termite claims paid in 2007 declined significantly, decreasing over 30% or $6.6 million as compared to 2006. Less than half of one
percent of customers filed claims in 2007. In addition, our insurance casualty costs have declined due to the success of the Company's loss control programs.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company's depreciation and amortization increased slightly to $27.1 million or 0.8%, compared to the twelve months ended
December 31, 2006 due to the depreciation on purchased equipment of $16.2 million in 2007, which was partially offset by several fixed assets being fully depreciated during the year. For
the year ended December 31, 2007 $13.4 million of the total depreciation and amortization was related to the amortization of intangible assets.


Sales, General and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company's sales, general and administrative expenses increased $16.0 million or 5.7% compared to the twelve months ended
December 31, 2006 representing 33.1% of revenues compared to 32.7% in 2006. Sales, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased due to higher sales and
administrative salaries due to the expansion of the sales force. This is partially offset by the Company experiencing reductions in bad debt expense and in its summer sales program cost.

Interest Income

Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2.3 million, an increase of $0.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 due
primarily to higher average invested assets over the course of 2007.

Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate was 38.3% in 2007 compared to 39.3% in 2006 due primarily to an increase in tax exempt income.

Results of Operations—2006 Versus 2005

Overview

The Company's addition of the Industrial Fumigant Company in October 2005, along with continued emphasis on customer retention and building recurring revenues was the primary
driver of revenue growth of 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $858.9 million, an increase of $56.5 million or 7.0% from 2005 revenues of $802.4 million. The
Company's acquisition of the Industrial Fumigant Company in October 2005, increased revenue by $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and by $6.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005. The Company's historical business excluding the Industrial Fumigant Company was $833.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and
$796.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a $36.9 million increase or 4.6% for the year compared to 2005 as set forth in the following table:

The
Company's commercial revenue grew 9.0%, due primarily to the acquisition of the Industrial Fumigant Company, expanded sales force, better customer retention in Orkin's U.S. operations, and strong
growth in its Canadian business operations, which is fundamentally a commercial business. Residential pest control revenues rose by 4.9% in 2006, due to an increased number of leads received, better
average selling prices, continued improvements in customer retention, and a successful price increase. Every-other-month service, the Company's primary residential pest control service offering, now
comprises over 63% of our residential pest control customer base at December 31, 2006.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7.4% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 7.1% in 2005.

Cost of Services Provided

Cost of services provided for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $20.7 million or 4.7%. Gross margin expressed as a percentage of revenues increased,
representing 46.7% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 45.5% for the prior year. The dollar increase was mainly due to the addition of the Industrial Fumigant Company, which
accounted for $17.7 million of the total, as well as increases in service salaries, insurance and claims, and fleet expenses due to higher fuel costs. Service technician productivity and
average pay continued to improve, which leads to better employee retention and ultimately improved customer retention. Cost of services provided as a percent of revenue decreased primarily due to
reduced insurance and claims and favorable group medical costs.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $26.9 million or 10.6% higher than the prior year. The increase was due to an
additional $1.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense resulting primarily from the acquisition of the Industrial Fumigant Company. The Company had approximately $18.7 million
in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $25.5 million in 2005.

Sales, General and Administrative

Sales, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $20.8 million or 8.0% while the expense margin increased by
0.3 percentage points, or 32.7% of total revenues compared to 32.4% for the prior year. The dollar increase for the year was primarily a result of the acquisition the Industrial Fumigant
Company, as well as increases in administrative and sales salaries.
Sales, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased due to the higher salary expense related to approximately 100 plus sales associates the Company added to its sales force,
greater salaries due to expansion of call center staff offset by the lower relative Sales, General and Administrative cost of the Industrial Fumigant Company.


Pension Curtailment

In June 2005, the Company recorded a $4.2 million non-cash curtailment gain in accordance with SFAS No. 88, "Employer's Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits", ("SFAS No. 88") in connection with freezing our defined benefit pension plan, using actuarial assumptions consistent
with those we used at December 31, 2004. SFAS No. 88 requires curtailment accounting if an event eliminates, for a significant number of employees, the accrual of defined benefits for
some or all of their future services. In the event of a curtailment, an adjustment must be recognized for the unrecognized prior service cost associated with years of service no longer expected to be
rendered. This event did not reoccur in 2006.

Interest Income

Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1.5 million, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due
to lower average invested assets over the course of 2006.

Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate was 39.3% in 2006 compared to 40.0% in 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Flow

The Company's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $71.3 million, $63.3 million and $43.1 million, respectively.

The
Company's operations generated cash of $88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily from net income of $64.7 million, compared with cash provided by operating
activities of $85.2 million in 2006 and $76.8 million in 2005. The Company believes its current cash balances, future cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under
its $70.0 million line of credit will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future. To the extent the Company
incurs unanticipated capital expenditures or completes any significant acquisitions, the Company may fund such transactions using an increased credit facility or other equity or debt financing
arrangements. The Company's $70.0 million line of credit is designed for the Company to be able to increase the line with a minimum of effort.

The
Company made a contribution of $5.0 million to its defined benefit retirement plan (the "Plan") during each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 as a result of the Plan's
funding status. The Company's pension plan is currently fully-funded and management believes that it will not make any contributions to the pension plan during fiscal 2008. In the opinion of
management, additional Plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.


The
Company used $22.8 million on investments for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company invested approximately $16.2 million in capital expenditures during the year ended
December 31, 2007. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of equipment replacements and upgrades and improvements to the Company's management information systems. The Company
expects to invest between $15.0 million and $20.0 million in 2008 in capital expenditures. During 2007, the Company made several acquisitions totaling $6.8 million compared to
$10.1 million during 2006. The acquisitions were fully funded with cash from operations in 2007. The Company continues to seek new acquisitions and will also give consideration to any
attractive acquisition opportunities presented. The Company sold four international franchises, one each in the United Arab Emirates, Honduras, the Dominican Republic and South Korea in 2007
generating $0.2 million in cash. The Company continues to seek new franchise opportunities both domestically as well as internationally.

The
Company used $59.8 million on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007. A total of $20.3 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.05 per share each quarter)
during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $17.0 million ($0.04 per share each quarter) during the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company used $42.0 million to
repurchase 2.4 million shares of its common stock (adjusted for the three-for-two stock spilt effective December 10, 2007) at an average price of $16.25 per share
during the year ended December 31, 2007 and there remain 1.0 million (post-split) shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board authorization

The
Company maintains $70.0 million of credit facilities with commercial banks, of which no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2007. The Company maintains approximately
$38.3 million in letters of credit, which reduced its borrowing capacity under the credit facilities. These letters of credit are required by the Company's fronting insurance companies and/or
certain states, due to the Company's self-funded status, to secure various workers' compensation and casualty insurance contracts. These letters of credit are established by the bank for
the Company's fronting insurance companies as collateral, although the Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

Litigation

Orkin, one of the Company's subsidiaries, is aggressively defending a class action lawsuit filed in Hillsborough County, Tampa, Florida. In early April 2002, the Circuit Court
of Hillsborough County certified the class action status of

Butland et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et
al

. Orkin appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals, which remanded the case back to the trial court for further findings. In December
2004 the Court issued a new ruling certifying the class action status. Orkin appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals. In June 2006, the Florida Second District Court of
Appeals issued a ruling denying certification of the class. Following the Plaintiffs' motion for rehearing, the court upheld its prior decision that class certification was improper but also ruled
that the Plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower class. Orkin will vigorously oppose any effort by the Plaintiffs to do so. In

Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin

Taxes

During the year ended December 31, 2007 a settlement was reached on a federal audit issue which resulted in the reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits
of $1.0 million and will result in
future reductions of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $0.9 million over the next two years. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits was reduced during the year ended
December 31, 2007 by $0.4 million for interest applicable to the settled issue. Filing of tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2006 reduced the liability for unrecognized
tax benefits by an additional $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007 state tax audits were settled resulting in a reduction
to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.1 million. Other state initiatives were completed during the year ended December 31, 2007 resulting in a reduction to the liability
for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.2 million.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that
require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and
government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company's business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely
predict future significant claims. Positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts, more effective treatment methods, more effective termiticides, and expanding
training.


Accrued Insurance

—The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers'
compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether
reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company
contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration,
along with management's knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these factors. Due to the uncertainty
associated with the estimation of future loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data, actual developments may vary from the Company's projections. This is particularly true since
critical assumptions regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment. Therefore, changes in estimates may be material. Management's judgment is inherently
subjective and a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. It should be noted that
the number of claims have been decreasing due to the Company's proactive risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs. Initiatives that have been implemented include
pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and
post-accident drug testing. The Company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a "Red Alert" program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a
day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited-duty basis.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For
certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest
control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In
general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount
for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the
discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues. Termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual
units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations,
initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services. The amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service. Fair
values are generally established based on the prices charged when sold separately by the Company. The amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a
straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. Baiting renewal
revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Revenue
received for traditional termite treatments is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and
repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and
historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and, while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these
costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred
revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed


claims.
The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

As
the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred and no
longer accrued. The Company will continue to accrue for noticed claims.

Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

the Company estimates and accrues for its liability and
costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the
litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the
opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (or "FAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The revision
is referred to as "FAS 123R—Share-Based Payment" (or "FAS 123R"), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," (or "APB 25")
and requires companies to recognize compensation expense, using a fair-value based method, for costs related to share-based payments including stock options and stock issued under our
employee stock plans. The Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective basis on January 1, 2006. The Company's adoption of FAS 123R resulted in compensation expense
which had no affect on diluted net income per share for 2006. Stock-based compensation expense is affected by our stock price, as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions and
the related tax effect. These valuation assumptions include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88 106, and 132(R)."

SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit
post-retirement plans as an asset or a liability in its statement of financial position. The funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit
obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). An employer is also required to measure the
funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income. SFAS 158 also
requires certain disclosures regarding the effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and the
transition asset or obligation. The Company was required to recognize the funded status of the plan in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company had previously
recognized the funded status of the plan in prior financial statements. See Note 8—Employee Benefit and Stock Compensation Plans for additional information related to this plans.
The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the year-end statement of financial position is effective for the Company's financial statements beginning
with the year ended after December 15, 2008. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for the plans.


Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—

an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109"

("FIN 48"), which provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. The Company is
subject to the provisions of FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, and has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal, state and foreign filing jurisdictions where it is required to file
income tax returns, as well as all open years in those jurisdictions. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company has recognized an increase of $1.7 million in the liability
for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a decrease to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. As of the adoption date, the Company had gross tax affected
unrecognized tax benefits of $6.1 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $3.8 million.

On
May 2, 2007 the FASB issued FIN 48-1,

Definition of Settlement

in FASB Interpretation No. 48. The definition of
settlement in FIN 48-1 does not have a material effect on the cumulative effect adjustment as recorded by the Company upon adoption of FIN 48.

Emerging Issues Task Force

In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") issued Issue 06-11 "

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based
Payment Awards

". The guidance in EITF Issue 06-11 addresses how an employer should account for the income tax benefits related to dividend or dividend equivalent
payments made to employees holding certain share-based payment awards. Entities are required to recognize tax benefits realized from dividend or dividend equivalents paid to employees for certain
share-based payment awards as an increase to additional paid-in capital and include such amounts in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb future tax deficiencies on
share-based payment awards. EITF Issue 06-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008 for
calendar-year entities). Entities should apply the consensus prospectively to income tax benefits of dividends on equity-classified employee share-based payment awards that are declared in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effects of the adoption of EITF Issue 06-11 on our consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, and financial position.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 141 revised, Business Combinations

. The objective of this Statement is to
improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects.
SFAS 141 revised is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 157,

"

Fair Value Measurements.

" SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective
for financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008. The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provision of SFAS 157 relating to certain non-financial assets and
liabilities until January 1, 2009. SFAS 157 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 is
effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities
at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Accordingly, companies would then be


required
to report unrealized gains and losses on these items in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity
to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 became effective for the Company on January 1,
2008 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB
No. 51

. The objective of this Statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its
consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the Noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the decosolation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is
effective
for the Company on January 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include
statements regarding the Company's belief that its relationship with vendors and levels of supplies will alleviate the potential short-term shortage in availability from its suppliers;
management's belief that environmental remediation costs estimated to be incurred are not material to the Company's financial condition or operating results; the outcome of litigation arising in the
ordinary course of business and the outcome of other litigation, as discussed in the Legal Proceedings section and elsewhere, the Company's expectation to continue its payment of cash dividends; the
Company's expectation that its Orkin Customer Service Center will contribute to growth in 2008 and improvement in responding to residential pest control and termite control leads; the ability of
Orkin's web search agency to make it easier for customers to access Orkin; the ability of Orkin's Yellow Pages agency to assist in improving marketing, help find customers and create more efficiency;
Orkin's expectation to go live at several branches early in the second half of 2008 on its routing and scheduling management system and schedule for a complete rollout of this system; the adequacy of
the Company's resources and borrowings to fund operations and obligations; management's belief that it will not make any contribution to its pension plan during fiscal 2008 and that any additional
plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operation or liquidity; the Company's projected 2008 capital expenditures; the impact of the
Company's contractual obligations; the impact of recent accounting pronouncements; and interest rate risks and foreign exchanges currency risk on the Company's financial position, results of
operations and liquidity. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks, timing and uncertainties including,
without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling against the Company in pending litigation; general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or technologies; the degree
of success of the Company's termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods; the Company's ability to identify potential acquisitions; climate and weather trends; competitive
factors and pricing practices; potential increases in labor costs; and changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. All of the foregoing risks and
uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from
those indicated by the forward-looking statements.


Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market Risk

The Company maintains an investment portfolio subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company is also subject to interest rate risk exposure through
borrowings on its $70.0 million credit facility. Due to the absence of such borrowings as of December 31, 2007, this risk was not significant in 2007 and is not expected to have a
material effect upon the Company's results of operations or financial position going forward. However, the Company does maintain approximately $38.3 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is
also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material effect upon the Company's results of
operations or financial position going forward.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries

1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business Description

—Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the
state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is a national service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and
commercial customers in North America with domestic franchises and international franchises in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia.

Orkin, Inc.
("Orkin"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is one of the world's largest pest and termite control companies. It provides customized services from over 400
locations to approximately 1.7 million customers. Orkin serves customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia providing essential pest
control services and
protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin
operates under the Orkin®, and PCO Services, Inc.® trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin® brand name makes Orkin the most
recognized pest and termite company throughout the country.

PCO
Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Orkin was acquired by Orkin in 1999. PCO Services is the largest pest control service provider in Canada. The PCO Services brand name provides similar brand
recognition throughout Canada.

Western
Pest Services ("Western"), another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928 was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service
company and its business compliments most of the services Orkin offers in the northeastern United States.

The
Industrial Fumigant Company ("IFC"), another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of Pest Management and Sanitation
services and products to the food and commodity industries.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, includes the United States, Canada, Mexico,
Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia. The Company's results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company's
foreign operations.

Principles of Consolidation

—The Company's policy is to consolidate all subsidiaries, investees or other entities
where it has voting control, is subject to a majority of the risk of loss or is entitled to receive a majority of residual returns. The Company does not have any interest in other investees, joint
ventures, or other entities that require consolidation.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries owned by the Company. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Estimates Used in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of


America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenues

—The Company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are
performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and
commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a
given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company
offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The
Company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues. Termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the
inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid
termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services. The amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service. Fair values are generally
established based on the prices charged when sold separately by the Company. The amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straight-line
basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and
recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Revenue
received for traditional termite treatments is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and
repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and
historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and, while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these
costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred
revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is
made for any expected losses.

As
the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred and no
longer accrued. The Company will continue to accrue for noticed claims.

All
revenues are reported net of sales taxes.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 and approximately 7% for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005.

Interest
income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. Recognition of initial franchise fee revenues occurs when all material services
or conditions relating to a new agreement have been substantially performed or satisfied by the Company. Initial franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial Position
until such time. Royalties from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis. Gains on sales of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at
the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected
collectibility of accounts receivable. Management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectibility of accounts receivable.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are charged to expense during the year in which they are incurred.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

be cash equivalents. Short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.

Marketable Securities

—From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large,
well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company's investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than "investment grade" by national rating services. The
Company's marketable securities generally consist of United States government, corporate and municipal debt securities.

Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. Debt securities are
classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are
stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income.

The
Company had no Marketable Securities at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Materials and Supplies

—Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out basis) or market.

Income Taxes

—The Company provides for income taxes based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The Company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not
be utilized. The Company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Equipment and Property

—Depreciation and amortization, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under
capital leases, are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are computed using the following
asset lives: buildings, ten to forty years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, two to ten years. Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the
accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. The annual provisions for depreciation, below, have been


reflected
in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization:

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

—In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets

", the Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization;
(2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. The Company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives or goodwill. Goodwill and
other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include
an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the company level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing
the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with its carrying value. The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each
indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its
annual impairment analyses as of September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or other intangible
assets was indicated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

—In accordance with SFAS 144, "

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

", the Company's long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with
definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and
used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Based upon the results of
these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its long-lived assets was indicated.

Insurance

—The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability,
workers' compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur,
whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The
Company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major
consideration, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these factors. Management's
judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events.

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs
of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life
expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company's business practices. However, it is not possible
to precisely predict future significant claims. Positive changes to our
business practices include revisions made to our contracts, more effective treatment methods, more effective termiticides and expanded training.


Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of
business. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, the Company estimates and accrues
for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. It is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of
the litigation. However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Treasury Shares

—During the year ended December 31, 2007 the Company retired all of its existing treasury
shares, increasing the number of unissued but authorized shares, and began to retire common shares as they are repurchased. During 2007, 2.4 million shares (post the Company's
three-for-two stock split effective December 31, 2007) were repurchased for $38.6 million. During 2006, 1.5 million (post split) shares were repurchased
for $19.4 million. During 2005, 2.6 million (post split) shares were repurchased for $30.2 million.

Earnings Per Share

—In accordance with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per
Share

("EPS"), the Company presents basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed on the basis of weighted-average shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed on the basis
of weighted-average shares outstanding plus common stock options outstanding during the year, which, if exercised, would have a dilutive effect on EPS. Prior basic and diluted EPS for all years have
been restated for the stock split effective December 10, 2007. A reconciliation of the number of weighted-average shares used in computing basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

Translation of Foreign Currencies

—Assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars
are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables,
denominated in foreign currency are included in the earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company adopted FAS 123R as of January 1, 2006. Through
December 31, 2005, the Company has followed APB 25 to account for employee stock options. Under APB 25, the intrinsic value method of accounting, no compensation expense is
recognized because the exercise price of the employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company applied FAS 123 for disclosure purposes
only, and recognized compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.

In
order to estimate the fair value of stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options
which have no


vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time.

The
following proforma net income and earnings per share (or "EPS") for 2005 was determined as if the Company had accounted for employee stock options and stock issued under its employee stock plans
using the fair value method prescribed by FAS 123. The 2007 and 2006 actuals are presented for comparative purposes only.

Franchising Program

—Orkin had 58 franchises as of December 31, 2007, including international
franchises in Mexico, established in 2000, Panama, established in 2003, and Costa Rica, established in 2006, along with Honduras, the United Arab Emirates, the Dominican Republic and South Korea all
of which were established in 2007. Subsequently, the Company established two new international franchises in January 2008, one in Saudi Arabia and one in Qatar. Transactions with franchises involve
sales of customer contracts to establish new franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes
due over periods ranging up to 5 years.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

—The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable and other short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their
fair values.

Three-for-Two Stock Split

—The Board of Directors, at its quarterly meeting on
October 23, 2007, authorized a three-for-two stock split by the issuance on December 10, 2007 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of
record at November 12, 2007. Accordingly, the par value for additional shares issued was adjusted to common stock, and fractional shares resulting from the stock split were settled in cash. All
share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted for this stock split.

The
Board of Directors, at its quarterly meeting on January 25, 2005, authorized a three-for-two stock split by the issuance on March 10, 2005 of one additional
common share for each two common shares held of record at February 10, 2005. The share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related are as stated for this
stock split.

Reclassifications

—Certain amounts for previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 consolidated
financial statement presentation.

New Accounting Standards

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (or "FAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The revision
is referred to as "FAS 123R—Share-Based Payment" (or "FAS 123R"), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," (or "APB 25")
and requires companies to recognize compensation expense, using a fair-value based method, for costs related to share-based payments including stock options and stock issued under our
employee stock plans. The Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective basis on January 1, 2006. The Company's adoption of
FAS 123R resulted in compensation expense which had no affect on diluted net income per share for 2006. Stock-based compensation expense is affected by our stock price, as well as a number of
complex and subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax effect. These valuation assumptions include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option
exercise behaviors.


In
September 2006, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88 106, and 132(R)

." SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit
post-retirement plans as an asset or a liability in its statement of financial position. The funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit
obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). An employer is also required to measure the
funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income. SFAS 158 also
requires certain disclosures regarding the effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and the
transition asset or obligation. The Company was required to recognize the funded status of the plan in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company had previously
recognized the funded status of the plan in prior financial statements. See Note 8 — Employee Benefit and Stock Compensation Plans for additional information related to this
plans. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the year-end statement of financial position is effective for the Company's financial statements
beginning with the year ended after December 15, 2008. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for the plans.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—

an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

" ("FIN 48"), which provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. The Company is
subject to the provisions of FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, and has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal, state and foreign filing jurisdictions where it is required to file
income tax returns, as well as all open years in those jurisdictions. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company has recognized an increase of $1.7 million in the liability
for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a decrease to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. As of the adoption date, the Company had gross tax affected
unrecognized tax benefits of $6.1 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $3.8 million.

On
May 2, 2007 the FASB issued FIN 48-1,

Definition of Settlement

in FASB Interpretation No. 48. The definition
of settlement in FIN 48-1 does not have a material effect on the cumulative effect adjustment as recorded by the Company upon adoption of FIN 48.

Emerging Issues Task Force

In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") issued Issue 06-11 "

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based
Payment Awards

". The guidance in EITF Issue 06-11 addresses how an employer should account for the income tax benefits related to dividend or dividend equivalent
payments made to employees holding certain share-based payment awards. Entities are required to recognize tax benefits realized from dividend or dividend equivalents paid to employees for certain
share-based payment awards as an increase to additional paid-in capital and include such amounts in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb future tax deficiencies on
share-based payment awards. EITF Issue 06-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008
for calendar-year entities). Entities should apply the consensus prospectively to income tax benefits of dividends on equity-classified employee share-based payment awards that are
declared in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effects of the adoption of EITF Issue 06-11 on our consolidated results
of operations, cash flows, and financial position.


Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 141 revised, Business Combinations

. The objective of this Statement is to
improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects.
SFAS 141 revised is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements

." SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities on
January 1, 2008. The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provision of SFAS 157 relating to certain non-financial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009.
SFAS 157 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 is
effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and
liabilities at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Accordingly, companies would then be required to report unrealized gains and losses on these items in earnings
at each subsequent reporting date. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
assets and liabilities differently. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement
attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2008 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's
financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB
No. 51

. The objective of this Statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its
consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the Noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the decosolation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is
effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

2.     TRADE RECEIVABLES

The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency aging totals, based on contractual terms,
for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company policies that are specific to pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill was $126.7 million as of December 31, 2007
and $125.2 million as of December 31, 2006. The carrying amount of goodwill in foreign countries was $9.6 million as of December 31, 2007 and $8.1 million as of
December 31, 2006

On
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. As of January 1, 2002,
amortization of goodwill and trademarks was terminated, and instead the assets are subject to periodic testing for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment analyses as of
September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or trademarks has occurred.


5.     CUSTOMER CONTRACTS

Customer
contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio that current revenues bear to the
total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance with Statement 142, the expected lives of customer contracts were reviewed, and it was determined
that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of 8 to 12

The
Provision for Income Taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 38.3% on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007. For 2006 the effective tax rate was 39.25% and for
2005 the effective tax rate was 40.0%. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes. During 2007, 2006 and 2005,
the Company paid income taxes of $40.1 million, $31.3 million and $30.1 million, respectively, net of refunds.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes.

As
of December 31, 2007, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $320 million, which will be available to offset future state
taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2008 and 2025. Management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $295 million of these net
operating losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance increased by $2.9 million
due to additional losses generated in the current year.

Earnings
from continuing operations before income tax includes foreign income of $4.4 million in 2007, $2.7 million in 2006 and $2.2 million in 2005. The company intends to
reinvest indefinitely the undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. As of December, 2007, the Company had approximately $11.6 million of earnings from those international
subsidiaries that had not been remitted to the United States. Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or alternative means, the distribution would be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at the statutory rate of 35 percent, less foreign tax credits applicable to such distributions.

In
July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), which
provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result
of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company has recognized an increase of $1.68 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a decrease to the
January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $1.9 million. A reconciliation of
the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The
Company and its subsidiaries are subject to United States federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. In many cases these uncertain tax positions are
related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. The tax returns for 2002 and 2003 are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service. In
addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various state jurisdictions that are currently under audit for years ranging from 1996 through 2005. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S.
federal, state and local, or non-United States, income tax examinations for years prior to 2002.

It
is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease in the next twelve months. These changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing federal and state
audits. It is expected that other federal audit issues will be settled in the next twelve months resulting in a reduction of


the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.0 million, including interest. It is also expected that certain state audits will be completed in the next 12 months resulting in a
reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $0.3 million. None of the reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits discussed above will affect the effective tax
rate.

The
Company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $1.1 million and $0.8 million as of
January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, respectively. During 2007 the Company recognized interest and penalties of $0.2 million.

7.     ACCRUAL FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In
accordance with SFAS No. 5, "

Accounting for Contingencies

," the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated
costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide
life expectancy and government regulation.

Orkin,
one of the Company's subsidiaries, is a named defendant in

Mark and Christine Butland et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et
al.

pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa, Florida. The plaintiffs filed suit in March of 1999 and are seeking monetary damages and
injunctive relief. The Court ruled in early April 2002, certifying the class action lawsuit against Orkin. Orkin appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals, which remanded
the case back to the trial court for further findings. In December 2004 the Court issued a new ruling certifying the class action. Orkin appealed this new ruling to the Florida Second District Court
of Appeals. In June 2006, the Florida Second District Court of Appeals issued a ruling denying certification of the class. Following the Plaintiffs' motion for rehearing, the court upheld its prior
decision that class certification was improper but also ruled that the Plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower class. Orkin will vigorously oppose any effort by the
Plaintiffs to do so. Orkin believes this case to be without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously through trial, if necessary. At this time, the final outcome of the litigation cannot be
determined. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position;
however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter.

Additionally,
in the normal course of business, Orkin is a defendant in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services by
Orkin. Orkin is actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits have been filed (

Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating
Company, Inc., et al.; John Maciel v. Orkin, Inc., et al.

;

Ronald and Ileana Krzyzanowsky et al. v. Orkin
Exterminating Company, Inc. and Rollins, Inc.

;

Adam Stauber v. Rollins, Inc. et
al.

; and

Roy Sheppard et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. and
Rollins, Inc.

) in which the Plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class. The cases originate in Georgia, California, and Arkansas, respectively. In

Warren

, the
Superior Court of Cobb County, Marietta, Georgia, ruled in August 2006, certifying the class action against Orkin. Orkin appealed this
ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals, which in November 2007 denied certification of the class. Plaintiff appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court of Georgia, which in February 2008 denied
Plaintiff's petition for review. The

Maciel

lawsuit, a wage and hour related matter, was filed in the Superior Court of Los
Angeles County, California and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Krzyzanowsky

lawsuit, a
termite service related matter, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Stauber

lawsuit, a Fair Debt Collection Practices Act related matter, was filed in


the
United States District Court for the Central District of California and a date has not been scheduled for a hearing on class certification. The

Sheppard

lawsuit, a termite related matter, was recently
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas and a date has
not been scheduled for a hearing on class certification. The Company believes these matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest certification and defend itself through trial or
arbitration, if necessary. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual
quarter.

Orkin
is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company's liability under any of these matters would not and
did not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

9.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

Employee
Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plan

The Company maintains a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan (the "Plan") covering employees meeting certain age and service requirements. The
Plan provides benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five years during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average
anticipated Social Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plan with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company made contributions of $5.0 million to the Plan during
each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted amendments to the Plan including a change to the benefit calculation and limiting
plan participation to current participants. These amendments are reflected in benefit obligations below.

In
June 2005, the Company recorded a $4.2 million non-cash curtailment gain in accordance with SFAS No. 88, "Employer's Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined
Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits", ("SFAS No. 88") in connection with freezing our defined benefit pension plan, using actuarial assumptions consistent with those used at
December 31, 2004. SFAS No. 88 requires curtailment accounting if an event eliminates, for a significant number of employees, the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their
future services. In the event of a curtailment, an adjustment must be recognized for the unrecognized prior service cost associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered.


The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for its defined benefit post-retirement plans. The funded status of the Plan and the net amount recognized in the
statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of:

The
return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in the plan. The expected
long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.

The
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, for fiscal year 2007 the Company utilized a
yield curve analysis. During fiscal 2006, the Company used Moody's Aa long-term corporate bond yield with yield adjustments made for longer duration of the Company's obligation. A lower
discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations.

The
estimated net loss that will be amortized in 2008 is expected to be $3.7 million. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Plan's assets were comprised of listed common stocks and U.S.
government and corporate


securities.
Included in the assets of the Plan were shares of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock with a market value of $19.6 million and $15.1 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

The
Plan's weighted average asset allocation at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 by asset category, along with the target allocation for 2008, are as follows:

Our
investment strategy for our pension plan is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing
pension benefits. The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class, which is rebalanced as required. The plan utilizes a number of investment approaches, including individual
market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. The Company estimates that it will not contribute
to the pension plan in 2008 and does not expect to receive a refund in 2008. The estimated future benefit payments over the next ten years are as follows:

Deferred Compensation 401(k) Plan

The Company sponsors a defined compensation 401(k) Plan that is available to substantially all full-time employees the first of the calendar quarter following
completion of three months of service. The Plan is available to non full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one year of service upon completion of
1,000 hours in that year. The Plan provides for a matching contribution of fifty cents ($.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions to the Plan that do not exceed
6 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). The charge to expense for the Company match was approximately $5.1 million in 2007,
$4.3 million in 2006 and $3.9 million in 2005. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 approximately, 30.5%, 30.1% and 29.8%, respectively of the plan assets consisted of
Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total administrative fees for the Plan were approximately $124 thousand in 2007, $159 thousand in 2006 and $240 thousand in 2005.


Stock Compensation Plans

All
share and per share data has been adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective December 10, 2007.

Stock
options and time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company's Employee Stock Incentive Plan. The Company's stock options
generally vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the
terms of the issue. The Company issued TLRSs that vest over ten years prior to 2004. TLRSs issued
2004 and later vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends
declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until
restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

For
the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company issued approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees. For the year ended
December 31, 2006, the Company issued approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees.

The
Company issued 0.4 million time lapse restricted shares for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The
Company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2007, approximately 6.1 million shares of the Company's common stock were reserved for
issuance. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted
including stock options and TLRSs based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. SFAS 123R supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
"

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

" and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "

Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees

" ("APB 25"). The Company has adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires the Company to record
compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those
awards with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December 31, 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with provisions of SFAS 123R and recognized on a
straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company estimated forfeiture rates for 2007 and 2006 based on its historical experience.

Prior
to 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB 25 using the intrinsic value method, which did not require that compensation cost be recognized for the
Company's stock options provided the option exercise price was established at 100% of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. Under APB 25, the Company was required to record
expense over the vesting period for the fair value of TLRSs granted. Prior to 2006, the Company provided pro forma disclosure, as if the fair value method defined by SFAS No. 123 had been
applied to its stock-based compensation. The Company's net income and net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been reduced if compensation cost related to stock
options had been recorded in the financial statements based on fair value at the grant dates.

In
order to estimate the fair value of stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options
which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time.


The
Company's only remaining options outstanding at December 31, 2007 for SFAS 123R purposes are the grants issued during the first quarter of 2003. The Company did not grant any stock
options in any years following the 2003 grant; therefore no Black-Scholes calculation was necessary.

As
a result of adopting SFAS 123R, the impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $0.3 million (net of
$0.2 million tax benefit) lower, than if the Company had continued to account for stock—based compensation under APB 25. There was no impact to both basic and diluted
earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The
following pro forma net income and earnings per share (or "EPS") for 2005 was determined as if the Company had accounted for employee stock options and stock issued under its employee stock plans
using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123. As reported numbers for 2007 and 2006 are presented for comparative purposes only.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Board
of Directors and Stockholders

Rollins, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2007 and
2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits of the basic
consolidated financial statements included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 in 2007 and adopted the recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,
"Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" and the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" in 2006.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated February 29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To
the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The
management of Rollins, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Rollins, Inc. maintains a system of
internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate
and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The internal control system is augmented by written
policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel. This system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2007 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management's assessment is that Rollins, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007.

The
independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007, and has also issued their
report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, included in this report on page 81.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Board
of Directors and Stockholders

Rollins, Inc.

We
have audited Rollins, Inc.'s (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Rollins, Inc.'s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by COSO.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 and
our report dated February 29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
