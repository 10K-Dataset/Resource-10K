DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

Portions of the Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Rollins, Inc. are incorporated by reference into Part III, Items 10-14.

PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America, Australia, and Europe with international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

For a listing of the Company's Subsidiaries, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-k).

The Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, which includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico are included in Item 8 of this document, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” on pages 28 and 29. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company’s foreign operations.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

All share and per share data presented have been adjusted to account for the three-for-two stock split effective March 10, 2015. At the July 24, 2012 Board of Directors’ meeting, the Board authorized the purchase of 7.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not repurchase shares on the open market compared to 0.8 million shares at a weighted average price of $27.19 in 2016, respectively. In total, there are 5.1 million additional shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

Backlog

Backlog services and orders are usually provided within the month following the month of order receipt, except in the area of prepaid pest control and bait monitoring services, which are usually provided within twelve months of order receipt. The Company does not have a material portion of its business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a governmental entity.

Franchising Programs

Orkin Franchises

The Company continues to expand its growth through Orkin’s franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently not economically feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are subject to a contractual buyback provision at Orkin’s option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise. International franchise agreements also contain an optional buyback provision; however, the franchisee has the prior right of renewal of agreement. The Company through its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994, and established its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico.


Critter Control Franchises

The Company expands its animal control growth through Critter Control’s franchise program. The Company has purchased several Critter Control locations from its franchise owners while renaming and converting several Trutech locations to Critter Control. The majority of Critter Control’s locations are franchised. Critter Control has franchises in the United States and two Canada as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.

Rollins Australia Franchises

The Company has Australian franchises through Rollins Australia’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Murray Pest Control and Scientific Pest Management. The Company purchased Murray Pest Control and Scientific Pest Management in 2016.

Seasonality

The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the Company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The Company has relationships with a national pest control product distributor and other vendors for pest and termite control treatment products. The Company maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers.

Competition

The Company believes that Rollins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, Orkin Canada, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, Trutech, Permatreat, Rollins Australia, Critter Control, Safeguard Pest Control and Northwest Exterminating competes favorably with competitors as the world’s largest pest and termite control company. The Company’s competitors include Terminix, Ecolab, Rentokil and Anticimex.

The principal methods of competition in the Company’s pest and termite control markets are quality of service, customer proximity and guarantee terms, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, and price.


Research and Development

Expenditures by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and improved service methods and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies. Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.

The Company maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.

The Company conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products.  The Company also works closely with leading scientists, educators, industry consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

The Company’s pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment, public health and consumers. Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”)

This federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control companies operate. Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the following: licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This allows each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens’ wishes in each state. The pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (“FQPA”)

The FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts its business.

Environmental Remediation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, is the primary Federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous substances, and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will work with the EPA and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Consistent with the Company’s responsibilities under these regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these situations arise, the Company accrues management’s best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management’s current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the Company’s financial condition or operating results.

Employees

The number of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2018 was approximately 13,000.

Item 1.A.    Risk Factors

Our business depends on our strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers.

Our strong brands, Rollins, Orkin, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest Services, Northwest Exterminating, The Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, Trutech, Permatreat, Critter Control, Allpest, Safeguard Pest Control and other strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business.  Maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers.  Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues and product/technical failures.  Further, if our brands are significantly damaged, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.  Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide high-quality, pest control products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people’s lives.

Economic conditions may adversely affect our business

Pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers. As consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.

Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees is high, and the supply is very limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and profitability could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

We may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices, and general economic issues. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality, and product availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.

Our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.

In the normal course of business, some of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged.  The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year.

Our operations could be affected if there is unauthorized access of personal, financial, or other data or information about our customers, employees, third parties, or of  Company’s proprietary of confidential information.  We could be subject to interruption of our business operations, private litigation, reputational damage and costly penalties.

Our information technology systems, as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers, can contain personal, financial, health, or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Our information technology systems also contain Company’s and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and product development initiatives. We rely on, among other things, commercially available vendors, cyber protection systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of this information and data. The systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card


transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, meet standards set by the payment card industry (“PCI”). We continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for data security compliance purposes, and such standards may change from time to time. Activities by third parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our systems. Any compromises, breaches or errors in applications related to our systems or failures to comply with applicable standards could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations, including our customers’ ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products and could result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations, orders, industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs, penalties and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Also, a breach of data security could expose us to customer litigation and costs related to the reporting and handling of such a breach.

Our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted. We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations. We also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.

We may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

Our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide. The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods. The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods.

Our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could take actions that could harm our business.

Our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them. Each franchising brand also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control, and who own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses. As a result, the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed. This could adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Similarly, if subcontractors, vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws, standards and regulations, we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third‑party distributors, subcontractors, vendors and franchisees. In addition, our relationship with our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could become strained (including resulting in litigation) as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required standards. These strains in our relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

From time to time, we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints, disputes or questions about our practices and standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements. If franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us, we would vigorously defend against the claims in any


such proceeding. Our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted and the price of our common stock could decline.

Our brand recognition could be impacted if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.

Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license, particularly our registered brand names and service marks, Orkin

and others. We have not sought to register or protect every one of our marks either in the United States or in every country in which they are or may be used. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand names, we could suffer a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products, services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights.

The Company’s management has a substantial ownership interest; public stockholders may have no effective voice in the Company’s management.

The Company has elected the “Controlled Company” exemption under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) Listed Company Manual. The Company is a “Controlled Company” because a group that includes the Company’s Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins and his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and a director of the Company and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company’s voting power. As a “Controlled Company,” the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.

Rollins, Inc.’s executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 56 percent of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Our management has a substantial ownership interest, and the availability of the Company’s common stock to the investing public may be limited.

The availability of Rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive officers, directors and their affiliates, which could negatively impact Rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders to sell their shares. Future sales by executive officers, directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.

Provisions in Rollins, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the Company.

Rollins, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the Board of Directors. These provisions may make a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company’s Board of Directors more difficult or expensive.

Item 1.B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None


Item 2.    Properties.

The Company’s administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The Company owns or leases over 500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins Training Center located in Atlanta, Georgia, the Rollins Customer Service Center located in Covington, Georgia, and the Pacific Division Administration and Training Center in Riverside, California. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important physical property of the Company. The facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases and claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. We are actively contesting each of these matters.

Management does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures.

Not applicable.

Presentation

This discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion (as well as other discussions in this document) contains forward-looking statements. Please see “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.

The Company

Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc. The Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America, Australia, and Europe with international franchises in Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that specifies the treatment and the pricing arrangement with the customer.

The Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company’s foreign operations.

Overview

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General Operating Comments

2017 marked the Company’s 20th consecutive year of improved revenues and profits.  Revenues for the year rose 6.4 percent to $1.674 billion compared to $1.573 billion for the prior year.  Income before income taxes increased 13.0% to $294.5 million compared to $260.6 million the prior year.  Net income increased 7.0% to $179.1 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.82 compared to $167.4 million, or $0.77 per diluted share for the prior year.

The Company’s 2017 net income was negatively affected by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) which was signed in to law on December 22, 2017.  The estimated negative impact of the enactment of the TCJA was an $11.6 million increase to tax expense, which was a direct decrease to net income.  The $11.6 million increase in tax was as follows: $8.0 million from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets, and $0.7 million from reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation.  This resulted in a $0.05 per diluted share decrease in net income for the year.

Net income excluding the effect of the TCJA increased 13.9% to $190.7 million or $0.87 per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the effect of the TCJA are non-GAAP financial measures.  Management believes these measures help investors understand the effect of these on reported results.

All of the Company’s business lines experienced growth for the year, with residential pest control revenues up 6.4%, commercial pest control revenues up 5.1% and termite and ancillary services revenues up 9.7%.


During the year, the Company increased its presence around the world with the addition of 11 new Orkin international franchises.  HomeTeam Pest Defense announced that they had reached one million TAEXX

installations.  We acquired Northwest Exterminating based in Marietta, GA which contributed in the growth of the Company's revenues the last five months.  Strategic acquisitions remain a priority for Rollins.  The Company also continued to improve our routing and scheduling capabilities as we utilize our Customer Service Manager (“CSM”) BOSS and its Virtual Route Management feature.  BOSS has been fully implemented in the Orkin’s U.S. operations.

Strategic acquisitions remain a priority for Rollins, and as in the past, we will continue to seek out companies that are a “fit” for us in both, the pest control and wildlife areas of our business.

Results of Operations—2017 Versus 2016

Overview

The Company’s revenues increased to $1.674 billion in 2017, a 6.4% increase compared to 2016.  Gross margin increased to 51.0% for 2017 from 50.9% in 2016.  Sales, general and administrative expense were 30.1% of revenues in 2017 compared to 31.2% in 2016.  The Company’s depreciation and amortization margin increased 0.2 percentage points to 3.4% in 2017 compared to 3.2% in 2016.  Rollins’ net income of $179.1 million in 2017 was an increase of $11.7 million or 7.0% over $167.4 million in 2016.  Net profit margin improved to 10.7% in 2017 from 10.6% in 2016.  Rollins continued to expand our global brand recognition with acquisitions in the United States and Canada as well as expanding our Orkin international franchise program in numerous countries around the globe.  The Company is now in 53 countries and continues to seek new international opportunities.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.674 billion, an increase of $100.5 million or 6.4% from 2016 revenues of $1.573 billion.  Growth occurred across all service lines and brands with our Canadian and Australian companies being hindered by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Organic growth and pricing accounted for approximately 4.5% of our increase and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth.  Commercial pest control represented approximately 40% of the Company’s revenue in 2017 and grew 5.1% due to increases in sales, an emphasis on closing leads, increased bed bug revenue, and acquisitions. Commercial pest control was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange as Orkin Canada and Rollins Australia are heavily commercial.  Residential pest control, which represented approximately 42% of the Company’s revenue, increased 6.4% driven by an increase in lead closure, pricing, as well as increased TAEXX

homebuilder installations, and acquisitions.  The Company’s termite business, which represented approximately 18% of the Company’s revenue, grew 9.7% in 2017 due to acquisitions, increases in drywood fumigations and ancillary service sales, (such as moisture control and insulation).

The Company implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2017.  Less than 2% of the Company’s revenue increase is attributable to pricing actions.  Approximately 80% of the Company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2017 as well as 2016.

The Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% and 7% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2017 for a total of 81 Orkin international franchises, two Canadian Critter Control franchises, and eleven Australian franchises operated by Murray Pest Control and Scientific Pest Management at December 31, 2017, compared to 70 Orkin international franchises, two Canadian Critter Control franchises and seven Australian Franchises at December 31, 2016.

International and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the Company’s revenues for 2017.  Orkin had 128 and 120 franchises (domestic and international) at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The Company had 89 Critter Control franchises at December 31, 2017, down 5 from 2016.  Critter Control Operations, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has begun the process of purchasing Critter Control franchises.  Revenue from franchises was down 2.9% in 2017 compared to 2016 as we acquire franchises from Critter Control.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 cost of services provided increased $47.6 million or 6.2%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.  Gross margin for the year increased to 51.0% for 2017 compared to 50.9% for 2016 due to favorable service salary cost as we utilize BOSS, our CRM and operating system and VRM to improve our customer routing and scheduling to maximize efficiencies. We had lower administrative salaries as we maximize our efficiencies and lower insurance and claims as we saw reductions in our actuarial calculations on future losses and lower vehicle loss expenses.  The favorable margins were partially offset by higher fleet costs as gasoline prices rose and leased vehicle costs as we replace our fleet and materials and supplies as we increase termite treatments.  We experienced good cost controls across most spending categories during 2017 compared to 2016.


Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization increased $5.7 million, or 11.2% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.  The dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing $2.7 million or 10.7% as we continue to depreciate our CRM software BOSS, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.0 million or 11.5% for 2017 due to the additional amortization of customer contracts of Northwest Exterminating, as well as several other acquisitions over the last year.

Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $12.9 million, or 2.6% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.  SG&A decreased to 30.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 31.2% in 2016.  The Company had a one-time tax event to dissolve its subsidiary, Kinro Investment Inc. in 2016.  This increased SG&A expense $9.1 million or 0.6 percentage points due to the one-time tax event that was offset as a credit in income tax expense.  Administrative salaries were relatively flat to prior year as we reduced the number of temporary personnel working on the BOSS system. Personnel related costs were marginally lower as we experienced leveling of our premiums.  Gains in these areas were partially offset by higher sales salaries, fleet expense, and contractor expenses for various projects as well as the aforementioned 2016 foreign tax withholding expense.

Gain on Sales of assets, Net

Gain on sales of assets, net decreased to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.8 million in 2016.   The Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and owned property in 2017 and 2016.

Interest Income, Net

Interest income, net for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively.  Interest income for each year is due to interest received on cash balances in the Company’s various cash accounts.

Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 39.2% in 2017 compared to 35.8% in 2016, due primarily to the effects of the TCJA in 2017, a one-time tax event in 2016 and differences in state and foreign income taxes.  The estimated impact of the enactment of the TCJA was an $11.6 million increase to tax expense, which was a direct decrease to net income.  The $11.6 million increase in tax was as follows: ($8.0 million from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets, and $0.7 million from reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation).  The increase due to the TCJA was partially offset by a reduction related to the implementation of ASU 2016-09 that was a $4.0 million benefit. Management believes that the Corporate tax rate in 2018 will be in the mid 20% range with a lower rate in the first quarter 2018 adjusted throughout the year to the mid 20% range for the year.

Results of Operations—2016 Versus 2015

Overview

The Company’s revenues increased to $1.573 billion in 2016, a 5.9% increase compared to 2015.  Gross margin increased to 50.9% for 2016 from 50.4% in 2015.  Sales, general and administrative expense remained flat at 31.2% of revenues in 2016 compared to 2015.  The Company’s depreciation and amortization margin increased 0.2 percentage points to 3.2% in 2016 compared to 3.0% in 2015.  Rollins’ net income of $167.4 million in 2016 was an increase of $15.2 million or 10.0% over $152.1 million in 2015.  Net profit margin improved to 10.6% in 2016 from 10.2% in 2015.  Rollins continued to expand our global brand recognition with acquisitions in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom as well as expanding our Orkin international franchise program in numerous countries around the globe.  The Company is now in 47 countries and continues to seek new opportunities.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.573 billion, an increase of $88.2 million or 5.9% from 2015 revenues of $1.485 billion.  Growth occurred across all service lines and brands with our Canadian and Australian companies being hindered by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Organic growth and pricing accounted for approximately 5.2% of our increase and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth.  Commercial pest control represented approximately 40% of the Company’s revenue in 2016 and grew 4.4% due to increases in sales, increased bed bug revenue, an increase in commercial fumigations, and acquisitions. Commercial pest control was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange as Orkin Canada and Rollins Australia are heavily commercial.  Residential pest control which represented approximately 42% of the Company’s


revenue, increased 7.3% driven by increased leads, the improved closure and pricing as well as increased TAEXX® homebuilder installations, bed bug revenues and acquisitions.  The Company’s termite business, which represented approximately 17% of the Company’s revenue, grew 6.3% in 2016 due to acquisitions, increases in drywood fumigations and ancillary service sales, (such as moisture control and insulation).

The Company implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2016.  Less than 2% of the Company’s revenue increase came from pricing actions.  Approximately 80% of the Company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2016 as well as 2015.

The Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Foreign currency exchange translation and increased domestic revenues have reduced the percentage in both years.  The Company established new franchises in several countries around the globe in 2016 for a total of 70 Orkin international franchises, two Canadian Critter Control franchises, and seven Australian franchises operated by Murray Pest Control and Scientific Pest Management at December 31, 2016, compared to 48 Orkin international franchises and two Canadian Critter Control franchises at December 31, 2015.

International and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the Company’s revenues for 2016.  Orkin had 120 and 99 franchises (domestic and international) at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Company had 94 Critter Control franchises and 4 Murray Pest Control franchises at December 31, 2016, down 14 from 2015.  Critter Control Operations, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has begun the process of purchasing Critter Control franchises.  Revenue from franchises was up 8.4% in 2016 compared to 2015.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 cost of services provided increased $36.4 million or 4.9%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.  Gross margin for the year increased to 50.9% for 2016 compared to 50.4% for 2015 due to favorable service salary cost as we finalized the roll-out of BOSS, our CRM and operating system, improving our routing and scheduling to maximize efficiencies, lower personnel related expenses as healthcare claims were lower than expected, and insurance and claims were lower as a percentage of revenues as we continue to focus on efficiency and safety.  The favorable margins were partially offset by professional fees as we used outside sources to roll-out BOSS.  We experienced good cost controls across most spending categories during 2016 compared to 2015.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization increased $6.4 million, or 14.3% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.  The dollar increase was due primarily to depreciation increasing $5.4 million as we began to depreciate our CRM software BOSS, while amortization of intangible assets increased as we acquired 34 companies in 2016.

Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $26.8 million, or 5.8% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.  SG&A remained flat at 31.2% of revenues for each of the years 2016 and 2015.  The Company had a one-time tax event to dissolve its subsidiary, Kinro Investment Inc.  This increased SG&A expense $9.1 million or 0.6 percentage points due to the one-time tax event that was offset as a credit in income tax expense.  Sales salaries increased due to the increase in sales commissions and service contracts increased as a result of maintaining the BOSS system.  The increases were offset by decreases as a percentage of revenue by administrative salaries as we continue to grow revenue with a static headcount, personnel related expense margin decreased due to lower than expected healthcare claims, and decreases in insurance claims as we continue to focus on efficiency and safety, and telephone costs as we negotiate contracts for Internet service.

Gain on Sales of assets, Net

Gain on sales of assets, net decreased to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.0 million gain in 2015.   The Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and owned property in 2016 and 2015.  The decrease was due to the Company selling two buildings in 2015.

Interest (Income)/Expense, Net

Interest income, net for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.2 million.  Interest income for each year is due to interest received on cash balances in the Company’s various cash accounts.


Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 35.8% in 2016 compared to 37.4% in 2015, due primarily to a one-time tax event in 2016 and differences in state and foreign income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Flow

Cash from operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses.

The most significant source of cash in Rollins’ cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $107.1 million, $142.8 million, and $134.6 million, respectively.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

The Company’s operations generated cash of $235.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily from net income of $179.1 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $226.5 million in 2016 and $196.4 million in 2015.  The Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities and available borrowings under its $175.0 million credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future.

The Company’s made no contributions to the Rollins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ defined benefit retirement plans (the “Plans”) during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Plans were fully-funded with a prepaid balance. We contributed $3.3 million and $5.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of the Plans’ funding status. The Company’s management is not expecting to make a contribution during fiscal year 2018.  In the opinion of management, additional Plan contributions, if any, will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

The Company used $154.2 million on investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $76.8 million and $69.9 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, and of that, invested approximately $24.7 million in capital expenditures during 2017 compared to $33.1 million and $39.5 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology related projects. The Company expects to invest between $25.0 million and $28.0 million in 2018 in capital expenditures.  During 2017, the Company’s and its subsidiaries acquired Northwest Exterminating as well as several small companies for a total of $130.2 million compared to $46.3 million and $33.5 million in acquisitions during 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The expenditures for the Company’s acquisitions were funded with cash on hand.  The Company continues to seek new acquisitions.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

The Company used cash of $130.3 million on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $136.4 million and $97.2 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.  A total of $122.0 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.56 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2017 including a special dividend paid in December 2017 of $0.10 per share, compared to $109.0 million in cash dividends paid ($0.50 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2016, including a special dividend paid in December 2016 of $0.10 per share and $91.8 million paid in cash dividends ($0.42 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2015, including a special dividend paid in December 2015 of $0.10 per share.


The Company did not purchase shares on the open market during the year ended December 31, 2017 while using $8.2 million to repurchase 0.8 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $27.19 per share during 2016 and $0.4 million to purchase 19 thousand shares at an weighted average price of $22.42 in 2015.  There remain 5.1 million shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval.  The Company repurchased $8.2 million, $8.4 million, and $7.0 million of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.

The Company’s $107.1 million of total cash at December 31, 2017, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $57.8 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $49.3 million is primarily held in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.

The Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies.  Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The Company maintains a large cash position in the United States while having no third-party debt to service.  Rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business.

Litigation

For discussion on the Company’s legal contingencies, see note 13 to the accompanying financial statements.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

Other than the operating leases disclosed in the table that follows, the Company has no material off balance sheet arrangements.

The impact that the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:

(1)

These amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017.

(2)

Minimum pension funding requirements are not included as funding will not be required.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management’s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. Accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.


Accrued Insurance—

The Company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’ compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts with an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. The Company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. Initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing, increased driver training and a post-injury nurse triage program for employees.

Revenue Recognition—

The Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

All revenues are reported net of sales taxes.

Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Defined benefit pension plans

— In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005. The Company also includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan to the Company’s financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715

“Compensation- Retirement Benefits”

, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.


The Company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense. The Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from the prior year.

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. The discount rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2017 compared to 4.45% in 2016 and 4.7% in 2015. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.

As set forth in note 14 to the Company’s financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan’s investments are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-12 “

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),”

these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

As of December 31, 2017, the defined benefit plans were fully-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by $19.0 million before tax and $14.2 million after tax.

The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks, timing and uncertainties including, without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling against the Company in pending litigation; general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or technologies; the degree of success of the Company's termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods; the Company's ability to identify potential acquisitions; climate and weather trends; competitive factors and pricing practices; potential increases in labor costs; and changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market Risk

The Company maintains an investment portfolio subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company is also subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175.0 million credit facility. Currently, the Company has no outstanding borrowings. However, the Company does maintain approximately $29.4 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material effect upon the Company’s results of operations or financial position going forward. For a discussion of the Company’s activities to manage risks relative to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, see note 10 to the accompanying financial statements.


MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The management of Rollins, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Rollins, Inc. maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

This system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management’s assessment is that Rollins, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.

Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business Description

—Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America, Australia, and Europe with international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, LLC. (“Orkin”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite control company. It provides customized services from over


locations. Orkin either serves customers directly or through franchise operations, in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the Orkin

®

, and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada’s largest pest control provider and a leader in the development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western Pest Services (“Western”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers, focusing on the northeastern United States.

The Industrial Fumigant Company (“IFC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam Pest Defense (“HomeTeam”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx

®

tubes in the wall pest control system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders nationally.

Rollins Australia (“Rollins Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”), in February 2014. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional commercial, residential, and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity program and provides specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.

Critter Control, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. on February 27, 2015. Critter Control was established in 1983 and is headquartered in Traverse City, Michigan. The business is primarily franchised, operating in


states and


Canadian provinces.

Rollins UK was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to acquire Safeguard Pest Control (“Safeguard”). Safeguard, which was acquired in June 2016, is a pest control company established in the United Kingdom in 1991 with a history of providing superior pest control, bird control, and specialist services to residential and commercial customers.

Northwest Exterminating, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1951, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in August  2017. Northwest specializes in residential and commercial termite control, pest control, mosquito control, wildlife services, lawn care, insulation, and HVAC services, focusing on the Southeast United States.

The Company has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than

5%

of the Company’s total revenues.


The Company has only

one

reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer, few customers or foreign operations.

Principles of Consolidation

— The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Rollins, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The Company does not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership interest of

50%

or less. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, the Company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. The Company reclassified certain prior period amounts, none of which were material, to conform to the current period presentation. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Subsequent Events

—The Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. As of the filing date, February 26, 2018, there were no subsequent events that would affect the Company’s financial statements.

Estimates Used in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

— The Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial


-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase price to the

two

deliverables is based on the estimated relative selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

All revenues are reported net of sales taxes.

The Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately

8%

of revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2017

and

7%

for the years ended December 2016 and 2015. Currency exchange translation and increases in foreign revenues are the cause of the increased percentage from 2016.

Interest income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. Recognition of initial franchise fee revenues occurs when all material services or conditions relating to a new agreement have been substantially performed or satisfied by the Company, and initial franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial Position until such time. Royalties from franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis. Gains on sales of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable.  Management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectability of accounts receivable.  Substantially all of the Company’s receivables are due from pest control and termite services in the United States and selected international locations.  The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The Company’s established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. There were no large recoveries in


,


, and


.  We record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are charged to sales, general and administrative expense during the year in which they are incurred.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of

three months

or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.

The Company’s

$107.1 million

of total cash at

December 31, 2017

, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately

$57.8 million

is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining

$49.3 million

is primarily held in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.

The Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The Company maintains a large cash position in the United States while having no third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business for the foreseeable future.

Marketable Securities

— From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company’s investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than “investment grade” by national rating services.

Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included as a component of interest income.

The Company had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined benefit pension plan and the non-qualified deferred compensation plan at

December 31, 2017

and


. See note 14 for further details.

Materials and Supplies

— Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.


Income Taxes

—The Company provides for income taxes based on FASB ASC topic 740 "Income Taxes", which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns.  The Company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized.  The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold.  The Company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Equipment and Property

— Equipment and Property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are computed using the following asset lives: buildings,


to


years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment,


to


years. Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. The annual provisions for depreciation, below, have been reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

— In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 350,

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”

, the Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. The Company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives or goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the Company level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, then the Company will compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.  The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its most recent annual impairment analysis as of September 30, 2017. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets -

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 360,

“Property, Plant and Equipment”

, the Company’s long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including customer contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Insurance

—The Company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’ compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts with an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events.


Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. An accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Three-for-two stock split

—The Board of Directors at its quarterly meeting on January 27, 2015, authorized a three-for-two stock split by the issuance on March 10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at February 10, 2015. All share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are restated for the three-for-two stock split.

Earnings Per Share

— the FASB ASC Topic 260-10

“Earnings Per Share-Overall,”

requires a basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share presentation. Further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.

The Company has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. See note 15 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.

The basic and diluted calculations are the same as there were no stock options included in diluted earnings per share as we have no stock options outstanding. Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods.


A reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common stock (participating securities) is as follows (in thousands except per share data). All share and per share information in the following chart are restated for the stock split effective March 10, 2015:

Translation of Foreign Currencies

—Assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign currency are included in the earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based Compensation

— The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718 “

Compensation – Stock Compensation

.” Time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan.

TLRSs provide for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. Outstanding TLRSs vest in


percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over

six years

from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed. The fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over

six years

.

Franchising Program

– Rollins’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, had


,


and


domestic franchises as of

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively. Transactions with Orkin’s domestic franchises involve sales of customer contracts to establish new Orkin franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts and initial Orkin franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods ranging up to

five years

. Notes receivable from Orkin franchises were

$5.9 million

at

December 31, 2017

and

$5.0 million

at

December 31, 2016

. These amounts are included as financing receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

All Orkin domestic franchises have a guaranteed repurchase clause that the Orkin franchise may be repurchased by Orkin at a later date once it has been established; therefore, initial Orkin domestic franchise fees are deferred in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 952-605

“

Franchisor Revenue Recognition,” for the duration of the initial contract period and are included as unearned revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Deferred Orkin franchise fees were

$3.4 million

,

$3.0 million

, and

$2.9 million

at

December 31, 2017

,


, and


, respectively.

As of

December 31, 2017

,


and


, Orkin had


,


, and


international franchises, respectively. Orkin’s international franchise program began with its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico.

Royalties from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952

-605

“

Franchisor Revenue Recognition,” as revenues are earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from Orkin franchises was

$5.4 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

and

$5.1 million

and

$4.9 million

for the years ended


and


, respectively.

The Company’s maximum exposure to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to the Orkin franchises was

$2.5 million

,

$2.0 million

, and

$1.5 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively.

Rollins’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Critter Control, had


and


franchises in the United States and Canada as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. Transactions with Critter Control franchises involve sales of territories to establish new franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The territories and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes. Notes receivable from franchises were

$0.2 million

and

$0.3 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. These notes are not guaranteed.  The Company anticipates that should there be any losses from franchisees these losses would be recouped by removing the individual franchisee and re-selling the abandoned territory. These amounts are included as financing receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Recent Accounting Guidance

Recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2018 or later

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and International Accounting Standards Board issued their converged standard on revenue recognition Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606. This ASU replaces nearly all existing U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The standard prescribes a five-step model for recognizing revenue, the application of which will require significant judgment. The FASB issued ASU 2015-14 in August 2015 which resulted in a deferral of the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. During 2016, the FASB issued four ASUs that address implementation issues and correct or improve certain aspects of the new revenue recognition guidance, including ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These ASUs do not change the core principles in the revenue recognition guidance outlined above. ASU No. 2014-09 and the related ASUs referenced above are effective for Rollins, Inc. beginning January 1, 2018. The Company has completed its detailed review of all global revenue arrangements in accordance with these ASUs and the adoption of these ASUs January 1, 2018 has had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flow Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods.  Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual reporting period.  The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 it had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.


In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. The guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in ASC 606.  The amendments in the update are effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 it had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post retirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”). The update requires employers to present the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The other components of net benefit cost, including interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost/credit and actuarial gain/loss, and settlement and curtailment effects, are to be presented outside of any subtotal of operating income. Employers will have to disclose the line(s) used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost, if the components are not presented separately in the income statement. ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 it had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, an update to ASC Topic 718,

Compensation - Stock Compensation

. ASU 2017-09 clarifies the types of changes to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment award that requires modification accounting. ASU 2017-09 does not change the accounting for modification of share-based awards, but clarifies that modification accounting should only be applied if there is a change to the value, vesting condition or award classification and would not be required if the changes are considered non-substantive. ASU 2017-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 31, 2017. The adoption of the provisions of ASU 2017-09 on January 1, 2018 will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The updated accounting guidance requires changes to the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments not accounted for at fair value through net income. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). In September 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842), which provides additional implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Based on a preliminary assessment, the Company expects the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its assets and liabilities due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company is continuing its assessment, which may identify additional impacts this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):  Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge.  Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on the current Step 1).  The standard in this update is effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning in 2020.  Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017.  The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which provides new guidance intended to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2020. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.


2.    ACQUISITIONS

The Company has made


, and


acquisitions that are not material individually or in the aggregate to the Company’s consolidated financial statements during the years ended

December 31, 2017

, and


, respectively.  The largest acquisitions made during these periods are as follows:

The Company completed the acquisition of Northwest Exterminating effective August 1, 2017. Northwest was established in 1951 and services approximately

120,000

customers in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and North Carolina. Northwest Exterminating is the 17th largest pest control operator in the country, making it the largest Rollins acquisition since the Company acquired HomeTeam Pest Defense in 2008.

Rollins UK was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to acquire Safeguard Pest Control (“Safeguard”). Safeguard, which was acquired in June 2016, is a pest control company established in the United Kingdom in 1991 with a history of providing superior pest control, bird control, and specialist services to residential and commercial customers.

Total cash purchase price for the Company’s acquisitions in


and


were

$130.2 million

and

$46.3 million

, respectively.

The fair values of major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed along with the contingent consideration liability recorded during the valuation period of acquisition is included in the reconciliation of the total consideration as follows (in thousands):

3.    DEBT

On October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to

$175.0 million

, which includes a

$75.0 million

letter of credit subfacility, and a

$25.0 million

swingline subfacility. The Credit Agreement was amended on October 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2018 and add

three

optional

one year

extensions. On October 27, 2015 the Company exercised a one year extension option to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2019. As of

December 31, 2017

, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately

$29.4 million

in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company’s fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured status, to secure various workers’ compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

The Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2019, subject to up to

two

optional extensions of the Credit Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company’s election:

•

the Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative Agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the

Federal Funds

rate,

plus

0.50%

per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the U.S. Federal Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1)month,

plus

1.0%

per annum.


•

with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus an additional amount, which varies between

0.75%

and

1.00%

, based upon Rollins’ then-current debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2017, the additional rate allocated was

.75%

.

The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants restricting the Company’s ability to permit the ratio of the Company’s consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The Company was in compliance with applicable debt covenants at

December 31, 2017

and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2018.

4.     TRADE RECEIVABLES:

The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency aging totals, based on contractual terms, for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company policies that are specific to pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

At any given time, the Company may have immaterial amounts due from related parties, which are invoiced and settled on a regular basis.

5.    FINANCING RECEIVABLES

Rollins manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. The Company’s credit risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising Rollins’ customer base and dispersion across many different geographical regions. The credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an assessment of the individual’s Beacon/credit bureau score. Rollins requires a potential obligor to have good credit worthiness with low risk before entering into a contract. Depending upon the individual’s credit score the Company may accept with

100%

financing or require a significant down payment or turndown the contract. Delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. Financing receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.

Total financing receivables, net were

$37.7 million

and

$32.7 million

at

December 31, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

, respectively. Financing receivables are generally charged-off when deemed uncollectable or when


days have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment. The Company’s charge-off policy has been consistently applied during the periods reported. Management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Gross charge-offs as a percentage of average financing receivables were

4.3%

and

3.2%

for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

, respectively. Due to the low percentage of charge-off receivables and the high credit worthiness of the potential obligor, Management considers the entire Rollins, Inc. financing receivables portfolio has a low credit risk.

The Company offers

90 days

same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their credit worthiness. Interest is not recognized until the


st day at which time it is recognized retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. In certain circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest


when they reach

180 days

past due. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, there were ten and seven accounts that were greater than


days past due, respectively, which have been fully reserved.

Included in financing receivables are notes receivable from franchise owners. The majority of these notes are low risk as the repurchase of these franchises is guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, Inc., and the repurchase price of the franchise is currently estimated and has historically been well above the receivable due from the franchise owner. Also included in notes receivables are franchise notes from other brands which are not guaranteed and do not have the same historical valuation.

The carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of contracts. Long-term installment receivables, net were

$20.4 million

and

$16.7 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Rollins establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to insure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The allowance balance is comprised of a general reserve, which is determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance, and a specific reserve, which is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely that Rollins will recover its investment. The general reserve percentages are based on several factors, which include consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio and information derived from competitive benchmarking.

The allowance for doubtful accounts related to financing receivables was as follows:

The following is a summary of the past due financing receivables:

The following is a summary of percentage of gross financing receivables:


6.    EQUIPMENT AND PROPERTY

Equipment and property are presented at cost less accumulated depreciation and are detailed as follows:

Included in equipment and property, net at

December 31, 2017

and


, are fixed assets held in foreign countries of

$4.9 million

, and

$4.6 million

, respectively.

Total depreciation expense was approximately

$27.4 million

in


,

$24.7 million

and

$19.4 million

in


.


7.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable, and other short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values. The Company has financial instruments related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed in note 14.

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.

The following table presents our non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of

December 31, 2017

.

The following table presents our non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of

December 31, 2016

.

Cash and cash equivalents, which are used to pay benefits and deferred compensation plan administrative expenses, are held in Money Market Funds.

At

December 31, 2017

the Deferred Compensation Plan had


life insurance policies with a net face value of

$43.4 million

. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies had a net realizable value of

$18.3 million

and

$15.7 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. The total deferred compensation plan assets, recorded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position, were

$18.4 million

and

$15.9 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

8.    GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill was

$346.5 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and

$255.7 million

as of

December 31, 2016

. Goodwill increased for the year ended

December 31, 2017

due primarily to acquisitions, partially offset by currency conversion of foreign goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill in foreign countries was

$46.3 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and

$42.7 million

as of

December 31, 2016

. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2017

and


are as follows:


9.    CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Customer contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles - Goodwill and other”, the expected lives of customer contracts were reviewed, and it was determined that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of


to


years dependent upon customer type. The carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:

The carrying amount of customer contracts in foreign countries was

$29.8 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and

$29.7 million

as of

December 31, 2016

.

Other intangible assets include non-compete agreements, patents and finite lived and indefinite lived trade names. Non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from


to


years and patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over


years. The carrying amount and accumulated amortization for other intangible assets were as follows:

The carrying amount of other intangible assets in foreign countries was

$3.5 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and

$3.8 million

as of

December 31, 2016

.

Included in the table above are trademarks and trade names of

$35.0 million

and

$32.7 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. Also included in the table above are non-amortizable, indefinite lived intangible assets of

$32.2 million

and $

29.7 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

The carrying amount of customer contracts and other intangible assets, net were as follows:

Total amortization expense was approximately

$29.2 million

in


,

$26.2 million

in


and

$25.2 million

in


.


Estimated amortization expense for the existing carrying amount of customer contracts and other intangible assets for each of the five succeeding fiscal years are as follows:

10.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. To manage this risk, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments from time to time. Certain of the Company’s foreign operations expose the Company to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of the Company’s cash receipts and payments in terms of the Company’s functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments from time to time to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional currency, the U.S. dollar.

Hedges of Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency, the US dollar. The Company uses foreign currency derivatives, specifically vanilla foreign currency forwards, to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the USD-CAD and AUD-USD exchange rates. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the foreign currency exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in US dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlement date.

The Company does not currently designate any of these foreign exchange forwards under hedge accounting, but rather reflects the changes in fair value immediately in earnings. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings and were equal to a net loss of

$0.3 million

for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2017

and

$0.4 million

in


, respectively. As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company had the following outstanding derivatives that were not designated as hedges in qualifying hedging relationships (in thousands except for number of instruments):


The table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in thousands):

The table below presents the effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments on the Income Statement as of

December 31, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

(in thousands):


11.    INCOME TAXES

The Company’s income tax provision consisted of the following:

The primary factors causing income tax expense to be different than the federal statutory rate for


,


, and


are as follows:

Other includes the release of deferred tax liabilities, tax credits, valuation allowance, and other immaterial adjustments.

On December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts And Jobs Act ("TCJA") was signed into law. The TCJA reduced the 2018 corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% and made numerous other tax law changes.  Certain tax effects of the TCJA were recognized in year ended December 31, 2017 resulting in the recording of

$11.6 million

of additional tax expense.  The additional tax of

$11.6 million

related to the following components:

$8.0 million

related to the imposition of a tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries due to implementation of a territorial tax system,

$2.9 million

related to remeasurement of deferred tax assets to the 21.0% tax rate, and

$0.7 million

related to reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation.  A provisional amount based on reasonable estimates was made with respect to the tax implications associated with the deemed repatriated earnings on foreign subsidiaries based on the initial analysis of the TCJA.  This provisional amount is based on information currently available, including estimated tax earnings and profits from foreign investments. The Company continues to gather and analyze information, including historical adjustments to earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, in order to complete the accounting for the effects of the estimated transition tax. The TCJA has significant complexity and implementation guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, clarifications of state tax law and the completion of the Company's 2017 tax return filings could all impact these estimates.  The Company does not believe potential adjustments in future periods will materially impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  Any such adjustments will be treated in accordance with the measurement period guidance outlined in Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 118.  Additional guidance has been provided to address the accounting for the potential effects related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to include the tax expense in the year incurred.  The Company has not completed its analysis of the effects of the GILTI provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election.


The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of

39.2%

on income before income taxes for the year ended

December 31, 2017

.  The effective rate differs from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes and adjustments due to the TCJA partially offset by tax benefits associated with restricted stock.

For


and


the effective tax rate was

35.8%

and

37.4%

, respectively.  The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes, the increase of available foreign tax credit and the release of certain deferred tax liabilities.

During


,


and


, the Company paid income taxes of

$90.7 million

,

$88.8 million

and

$82.7 million

, respectively, net of refunds.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at

December 31, 2017

and


are as follows:

Analysis of the valuation allowance:

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately

$148 million

, which will be available to offset future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2018 and 2030. Management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately

$0.1 million

of foreign net operating losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance decreased by

$6.5 million

due to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.

Earnings from continuing operations before income tax include foreign income of

$22.1 million

in


,

$6.4 million

in


and

$17 million

in


. The Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign


markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisition of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not part of the Company’s current business plan.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2017

that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is

$0.6 million

. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various state and international jurisdictions that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2010 through 2015. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years prior to 2012.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase in the next 12 months.

The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were

$0.9 million

and

$0.4 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and

12.    ACCRUAL FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

A reconciliation of changes in the accrual for termite contracts is as follows:

The accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities,

13.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases buildings, vehicles and equipment under operating leases, some of which contain escalation clauses. The Company’s operating leases expire at various dates through 2028:


Future commitments under operating leases are as summarized:

In the normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases and claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. We are actively contesting each of these matters.

Management does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

14.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan

The Company maintains several noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”) covering employees meeting certain age and service requirements. The Plans provide benefits based on the average compensation for the highest

five

years during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated Social Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plans with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company made

no

contribution for the year ended December 31, 2017 and

$3.3 million

and

$5.0 million

to the Plans during the years


and


respectively.

In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005.  In 2016, the Plan was amended to allow certain vested participants the ability to elect for a limited time the commencement of their benefit in the form of a single-sum payment, not to exceed

$35,000

, or an annuity starting date of December 1, 2016.  In total

$8.8 million

was paid by the Plan during the year ended December 31, 2016, under this program.  The Plan did not offer any options for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015.

The Company includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan in the Company’s financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation- Retirement Benefits”, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.


In June 2005, the Company froze the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit pension plan. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for its defined benefit post-retirement plans. The funded status of the Plans and the net amount recognized in the statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of:

The accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans were

$202.3 million

and

$197.2 million

at

December 31, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

, respectively. Accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the same for the Plans. Pre-tax (increases)/decreases in the pension liability which were (charged, net of tax) credited to other comprehensive income/ (loss) were

$19.0 million

,

$3.0 million

, and

$14.8 million

in


,


, and


, respectively.

The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the accumulated benefit obligation and net benefit cost:

The return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in the plan. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.


The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year.  In estimating this rate, for fiscal year’s


,


, and


the Company utilized a yield curve analysis.

The components of net periodic benefit cost are summarized as follows:

The benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


, and


are summarized as follows:

The Company expects to amortize a net loss of

$3.1 million

in 2018. At

December 31, 2017

and


, the Plan’s assets were comprised of listed common stocks and U.S. government and corporate securities, real estate and other. Included in the assets of the Plan were shares of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock with a market value of

$32.0 million

and

$42.1 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

The Plans’ weighted average asset allocation at

December 31, 2017

and


by asset category, along with the target allocation for


, are as follows:

For each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. The Company and management are not considering making contributions to the pension plans during fiscal 2018.


Some of our assets, primarily our private equity

,

real estate, and hedge funds, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments.  For the

December 31, 2017

plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible.  For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager statements combined with discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.

Additionally, these investments are categorized as NAV investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value.  In accordance with ASU No. 2011-12 “Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately

70 percent

of investments for long-term growth and

30 percent

for near-term benefit payments, with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers.  Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies domiciled domestically and internationally.  Fixed-income securities include corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds

,

and U.S. Treasuries.  Other types of investments include real estate funds and private equity funds that follow several different investment strategies. For each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required.  The plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including but not limited to individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation.

The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of

December 31, 2017

. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. See note 7 for a brief description of the three levels under the fair value hierarchy.

The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of

December 31, 2016

. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value.


(1)

Cash and cash equivalents, which are used to pay benefits and plan administrative expenses, are held in Rule 2a-7 money market funds.

(2)

Fixed income securities are primarily valued using a market approach with inputs that include broker quotes, benchmark yields, base spreads and reported trades.

(3)

International equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments in their respective markets.

(4)

Real estate fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data.

(5)

Alternative/Opportunistic/Special funds can invest across the capital structure in both liquid and illiquid securities that are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments, or if no market price is available, instruments will be held at their fair market value (which may be cost) as reasonably determined by the investment manager, independent dealers, or pricing services.

There were no purchases, sales or transfers of assets classified as Level 3 in

The estimated future benefit payments over the next five years are as follows:

Defined Contribution 401(k) Savings Plan

The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) Savings Plan that is available to a majority of the Company’s full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following completion of

three months

of service. The Plan is available to non full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following

one

year of service upon completion of


hours in that year.  The Plan provides for a matching contribution of fifty cents (

$0.50

) for each one dollar (

$1.00

) of a participant’s contributions to the Plan that do not exceed


percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). The charge to expense for the Company match was approximately

$12.1 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

and

$11.0 million

and

$10.2 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

$0.1 million

for each of the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan

The Deferred Compensation Plan provides that participants may defer up to

50%

of their base salary and up to

85%

of their annual bonus with respect to any given plan year, subject to a

$2 thousand

per plan year minimum. The Company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts. The Company credited accounts of participants of long service to the Company with certain discretionary amounts (“Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions”) in lieu of benefits that previously accrued under the Company’s Retirement Income Plan up to a maximum of

$245 thousand

.

Accounts will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain “Measurement Funds.” Account values are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and Company credits had been converted into shares or other ownership units of selected Measurement Funds by purchasing (or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current purchase price of the relevant Measurement Fund at the time of the participant’s selection. Deferred Compensation Plan benefits are unsecured general obligations of the Company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company has established a “rabbi trust,” which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to indirectly fund any obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the extent that the


Company’s obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan exceed assets available under the trust, the Company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant’s death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment (a “Termination Event”). However, for any deferrals of salary and bonus (but not Company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a Termination Event. Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan in installments or lump-sum payments.

At

December 31, 2017

the Deferred Compensation Plan had


life insurance policies with a net face value of

$43.4 million

. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies were worth

$18.3 million

and

$15.7 million

at

15.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock Compensation Plans

Time Lapse Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units

Time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding over the remainder of the service period. The compensation cost recorded for these awards is based on their closing stock price at the grant date less the cost of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures. Cash flows related to share-based payment awards to employees that result in tax benefits in excess of recognized cumulative compensation cost (excess tax benefits) are classified as a financing activity in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.

TLRSs provide for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. TLRSs vest in


percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over

six years

from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

The Company issued time lapse restricted shares of

0.5

,

0.5

, and

0.7 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


, and


, respectively.

The Company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At

December 31, 2017

, approximately

4.3 million

shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718, “

Compensation – Stock Compensation,”

the Company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.
