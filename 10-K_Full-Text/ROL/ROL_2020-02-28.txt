Item
1.        Business

General

Rollins,
Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting,
Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control
services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in the
United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Asia with international franchises in Mexico, Canada, Central and South America, the
Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Our pest and termite control services are performed through
a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

For a
listing of the Company’s Subsidiaries, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the
Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K).

The Company
has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for
this segment, which includes the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East,
Asia, Africa, and Australia are included in Item 8 of this document, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”
on pages 27 and 28. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer
or a few customers or the Company’s foreign operations.

Three-for-Two
Stock Split

All share
and per share data presented have been adjusted to account for the three-for-two stock split effective December 10, 2018.

Common
Stock Repurchase Program

At the
July 24, 2012 Quarterly Board of Directors’ meeting, the Board authorized the purchase of 11.3 million shares of the Company’s
common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not repurchase shares on the open market. In
total, there are 7.6 million additional shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. The repurchase program
does not have an expiration date.

Backlog

Backlog
services and orders are usually provided within the month following the month of order receipt, except in the area of prepaid
pest control and bait monitoring services, which are usually provided within twelve months of order receipt. The Company does
not have a material portion of its business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the
election of a governmental entity.

Franchising
Programs

Orkin
Franchises

The
Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Orkin Systems, LLC, began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994, and
established its first international franchise in 2000. It has since expanded to Mexico, Central and South America, the
Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The
Company continues to expand its growth through the franchise program of its Orkin brand. This program is primarily used in smaller
markets where it is currently not economically efficient to locate a company-owned Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are
subject to a contractual buyback provision at Orkin’s option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula
applied to revenues of the franchise; however, the franchisee has the prior right of renewal of the agreement. International
franchise agreements also contain an optional buyback provision, subject to the franchisee’s renewal option.

Critter
Control Franchises

The
Company expands its animal control growth through the franchise program of its Critter Control brand. The Company has
purchased several Critter Control locations from its franchise owners while renaming and converting several previous Trutech
locations to Critter Control. The majority of Critter Control’s locations are franchised. Critter Control has
franchises in the United States and had two in Canada as of December 31, 2017, one of which was repurchased in 2018 to bring
the international count to one at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Seasonality

The
business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase
in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined
by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the Company’s pest and
termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The Company
has relationships with a national pest control product distributor and other suppliers for pest and termite control treatment
products. The Company maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing
needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers.

Competition

The Company
believes that Rollins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, Orkin Canada, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest Control of
Stockton, Inc. (“Clark Pest Control”), Western Pest Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control,
Waltham Services, Trutech, PermaTreat, Orkin Australia, Critter Control, Safeguard Pest Control, Northwest Pest Control, OPC Services,
and Aardwolf Pestkare competes favorably with competitors as the world’s largest pest and termite control company. The Company’s
major competitors include Terminix, Ecolab, Rentokil and Anticimex.

The principal
methods of competition in the Company’s pest and termite control markets are quality of service, customer proximity, guarantee
terms, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, and price.

Research
and Development

Expenditures
by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the
new and improved service methods and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies.
Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.

The Company
maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.

The Company
conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products.  The Company also works closely with leading
scientists, educators, industry consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.

Environmental
and Regulatory Considerations

The Company’s
pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment,
public health and consumers. Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Federal
Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”)

This
federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which
pest control companies operate. Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the
following: licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This allows
each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens’
wishes in each state. The pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food
Quality Protection Act of 1996 (“FQPA”)

The FQPA
governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts
its business.

Environmental
Remediation

The
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, is the primary
Federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible
parties. Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous
substances, and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will
work with the EPA and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation.
Consistent with the Company’s responsibilities under these regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments
and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As
these situations arise, the Company accrues management’s best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management’s
current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the Company’s financial condition
or operating results.

number of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2020 was approximately 15,000.

Item
1.A.         Risk Factors

Our
business depends on our strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands and develop a positive client reputation could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers.

Our strong
brands, Rollins, Orkin, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest Control, Western Pest Services, Northwest Pest Control, The Industrial
Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, Trutech, PermaTreat, Critter Control, Safeguard Pest Control, Aardwolf
Pestkare, OPC Services, and other strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business.  Maintaining
and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the
needs of our customers.  Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational
issues and product/technical failures.  Further, if our brands are significantly damaged, our business, operating results,
and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.  We continue to develop strategies and innovative tools
to gain a deeper understanding of customer acquisition, retention and client replacement in order to more effectively expand and
retain our customer base. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and
continue to provide high-quality pest control services that are truly beneficial and play a meaningful role in people’s
lives.

Economic
conditions may adversely affect our business.

Pest
and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers. If consumers restrict their discretionary
expenditures, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect
our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly
sensitive to adverse economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or
cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.

Expanding
into international markets presents unique challenges, and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations may not
be successful.

An element
of our strategy includes further expansion into international markets. Our ability to successfully operate in international
markets may be adversely affected by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and
legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption and currency laws and regulations, of the
countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in our existing and
future international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, difficulties
in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or
the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual
property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an adverse effect on the
financial results of our international operations.


Our
inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our ability
to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our ability
to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees is high,
and the supply is very limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in
our skilled labor force, increases in wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and profitability
could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

We
may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.

We operate
in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices, and general
economic issues. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a
finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality, product availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe that
our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to
maintain our competitive position.

Our operations could be affected
by pending and ongoing litigation.

In
the normal course of business, we and some of our subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which
allege that plaintiffs have been damaged.  The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or
litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position;
however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge
that might be material to the results of an individual year.

Our
operations could be affected if there is unauthorized access of personal, financial, or other data or information about our
customers, employees, third parties, or of the Company’s proprietary of confidential information. We could be subject
to interruption of our business operations, private litigation, reputational damage and costly penalties.

Our information
technology systems, as well as the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers,
can contain personal, financial, health, or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Our information
technology systems also contain the Company’s and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ proprietary and other confidential
information related to our business, such as business plans and product development initiatives. We rely on, among other things,
commercially available vendors, cyber protection systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission
and storage of this information and data. The systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions,
and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, meet standards set by
the payment card industry (“PCI”). We have also implemented policies and procedures to comply with consumer privacy
laws in the areas in which we operate. We continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for data security compliance
purposes, and such standards may change from time to time. Activities by third parties, advances in computer and software capabilities
and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise
or breach of our systems. Any compromises, breaches or errors in applications related to our systems or failures to comply with
applicable standards could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations, including our customers’
ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products and could
result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations, orders, industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs, penalties
and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations
and cash flows. Also, a breach of data security or failure to comply with rigorous consumer privacy requirements could expose
us to customer litigation, regulatory actions and costs related to the reporting and handling of such a violation or breach.


Our
operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our business
is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in
such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations,
how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, or whether additional laws and regulations
will be adopted. We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and
regulations. We also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. However,
such environmental laws are changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in the future, materially
affect our operations and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses,
fines, and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.

We
may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions
have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure investors that we will be able
to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure investors that
we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Any inability
on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

Our
operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

Our operations
are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide. The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the
Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of
termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically
resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods.
The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for
extended periods.

Our
franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could take actions that could harm our business.

Our franchisees,
subcontractors, and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth
in our agreements with them and applicable laws and regulations. Each franchising brand also provides training and support to
franchisees. However, franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control, and who own,
operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses. As a result, the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests
with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards,
royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed. This could adversely
impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Similarly, if subcontractors, vendors and franchisees
do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws, standards and regulations, we could be
subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third-party distributors, subcontractors,
vendors and franchisees. In addition, our relationship with our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could become strained
(including resulting in litigation) as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required
standards. These strains in our relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

From time
to time, we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints, disputes or questions about our practices and standards
in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements. If franchisees or groups representing
franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us, we would vigorously defend against the claims in any such proceeding.
Our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted, and
the price of our common stock could decline.


Our
brand recognition could be impacted if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights
that are material to our business.

Our ability
to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property
rights we own or license, particularly our registered brand names and service marks, Orkin

one of our marks either in the United States or in every country in which they are or may be used. Furthermore, because of the
differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same
protection in other countries as we would in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand
names, we could suffer a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash
flows. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to
defend against claims by third parties that our products, services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights.

The
Company’s management has a substantial ownership interest; public stockholders may have no effective voice in the Company’s
management.

The Company
has elected the “Controlled Company” exemption under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
Listed Company Manual. The Company is a “Controlled Company” because a group that includes the Company’s Chairman
of the Board, R. Randall Rollins, and his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and
a director of the Company, and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company’s
voting power. As a “Controlled Company,” the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.

Rollins,
Inc.’s executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly, or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the
aggregate, approximately


percent of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons
will effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate
transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could
also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Our
management has a substantial ownership interest, and the availability of the Company’s common stock to the investing public
may be limited.

The availability
of Rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive officers, directors
and their affiliates, which could negatively impact Rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders
to sell their shares. Future sales by executive officers, directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could
also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.

Provisions
in Rollins, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the Company.

Rollins,
Inc.’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements
for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the Board of Directors. These provisions may make a tender offer, change in
control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company’s Board of Directors more difficult or expensive.

Item 1.B.

Unresolved Staff Comments

None.


Item 2.

Properties.

The Company’s
administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The
Company owns or leases over 550 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins Training Center
located in Atlanta, Georgia, the Rollins Customer Service Center located in Covington, Georgia, and the Pacific Division Administration
and Training Center in Riverside, California. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important
physical property of the Company. The facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future
needs of the Company.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

In the
normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases
and claims from time to time, which may include claims on a representative or class action basis alleging wage and hour law violations.
We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. We are actively contesting
each of these matters.

Management
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual quarter or year.

General Operating Comments

2019 marked
the Company’s 22nd consecutive year of improved revenues. Revenues for the year rose 10.6 percent to $2.015 billion compared
to $1.822 billion for the prior year. Income before income taxes decreased 16.0% to $261.2 million compared to $310.7 million
the prior year. Net income decreased 12.2% to $203.3 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.62 compared to $231.7 million,
or  $0.71 per diluted share for the prior year.

All of
the Company’s business lines experienced growth for the year, with residential pest control revenues up 11.3%, commercial
pest control revenues up 8.9% and termite and ancillary services revenues up 11.6%, each compared to 2018.

Results of
Operations—2019 Versus 2018

Overview

The
Company’s revenues increased to $2.015 billion in 2019, a 10.6% increase compared to 2018. Gross margin decreased to
50.7% for 2019 from 50.9% in 2018. Service salaries and personnel related expenses for the 401(k) match were impacted by the Clark Pest Control acquisition. Sales, general and administrative expense were 30.9% of revenues in 2019 compared to 30.2% in 2018.
The Company’s depreciation and amortization expense increased 21.4% to 4.0% in 2019 compared to 3.7%
in 2018. Rollins’ net income of $203.3 million in 2019 was a decrease of $28.3 million or 12.2% compared to $231.7
million in 2018. Net profit margin declined to 10.1% in 2019 from 12.7% in 2018. Rollins continued to expand our global brand
recognition with acquisitions in the United States and Canada as well as expanded our Orkin international franchise program
in numerous countries around the globe. In our first 50 years, we have grown to over 2.4 million customers who are served in
65 countries, and those countries represent 73.6% of the world’s GDP. The Company continues to seek new international
opportunities.

Revenues

Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $2.015 billion, an increase of $194 million or 10.6% from 2018 revenues of $1.822 billion.
Growth occurred across all service lines with our Canadian and Australian companies being hindered by unfavorable foreign currency
exchange rates. Growth and pricing accounted for approximately 4.8% of our increase, and our acquisitions contributed the remaining
revenue growth. Commercial pest control represented approximately 38% of the Company’s revenue in 2019 and grew 8.9%. Acquisitions
from foreign companies, which are primarily commercial, contributed to the increase, as well as increases in sales, an emphasis
on closing leads, and better cancellation rates. Commercial pest control was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange
rates as our foreign companies are heavily commercial. Residential pest control, which represented approximately 43% of the Company’s
revenue, increased 11.3% driven largely by the Clark Pest Control acquisition, which is mainly residential. Other factors such
as increases in leads received, leads sold, a lower cancellation rate, and pricing, as well as increased TAEXX

®

homebuilder installations also contributed to the increase in residential pest control revenue. The Company’s termite business,
which represented approximately 18% of the Company’s revenue, grew 11.6% in 2019 due to acquisitions, increases in termite
baiting, and ancillary service sales (such as moisture control, insulation and deck and gutter work).


The Company
implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2019. Around 1% of the Company’s revenue increase is attributable
to pricing actions. Approximately 80% of the Company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2019, as well as 2018.

The Company’s
foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2019 for a total of 97 Orkin international
franchises, one Canadian Critter Control franchise, and ten Australia franchises at December 31, 2019, compared to 86 Orkin international
franchises, two Canadian Critter Control franchises and ten Australia franchises at December 31, 2018. The Australia franchises
operate under the Murray Pest Control and Scientific Pest Management names.

International
and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the Company’s revenues for 2019. Orkin had 147 and 133 franchises (domestic
and international) at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had 84 Critter Control franchises at December 31,
2019, up 4 from 2018. Revenue from franchising was up 3.2% in 2019 compared to 2018 as the Company continued to expand Orkin’s
international footprint and recognition of initial franchise fees.

Cost
of Services Provided

For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2019, cost of services provided increased $99.2 million or 11.1%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2018. Gross margin for the year decreased to 50.7% for 2019 compared to 50.9% for 2018 due to increased participation
rates in our enhanced 401(k) match to employees and an increase in group insurance premiums in 2019. Integration of acquisitions
resulted in slight increases in service salaries percentages.

Depreciation
and Amortization

For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019, depreciation and amortization increased $14.3 million, or 21.4% compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2018. The dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing $6.3 million or 20.7% from the depreciation
of acquired and purchased assets and depreciation from various IT related projects. Amortization of intangible assets increased
$8.0 million or 22.1% for 2019 due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions over the last
year, including a full year of OPC Services and Aardwolf Pestkare, acquired in early and mid-2018, respectively, and the 2019
acquisition of Clark Pest Control in April, as well as several smaller foreign and domestic companies.

Sales,
General and Administrative

For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2019, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $72.7 million, or 13.2%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. SG&A increased to 30.9% of revenues for the year ended December 31,
2019 compared to 30.2% in 2018. The Company incurred higher than normal expenses in 2019 related to acquisition preparation and
integration as well as expenses related to the pension settlement activities. The enhanced 401(k) match enticed more of the Company’s
workforce to save for their futures. Administrative salaries were up due to increased office headcount and wages. Medical and
casualty insurance expenses were up for the year. The Company also had increased use of outside professional services in IT projects
as well as other projects.

Gain
on Sales of assets, Net

Gain
on sales of assets, net decreased to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million in 2018. The Company
recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and owned property in 2019 and 2018.


Interest Expense, Net

Interest
expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $6.9 million, driven largely by new borrowings to fund acquisitions, among
other things. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company earned $0.2 million in net interest income on cash balances in
the Company’s various cash accounts.

Taxes

The Company’s
effective tax rate was 22.1% in 2019 compared to 25.4% in 2018, due primarily to state and foreign income taxes and beneficial
adjustments related to the pension settlement.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash
and Cash Flow

Cash from
operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses.

The most
significant source of cash in Rollins’ cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is
collecting cash resulting from services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees,
tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.

The Company’s
cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $94.3 million, $115.5 million, and $107.1 million, respectively.

Cash Provided
by Operating Activities

The Company’s
operations generated cash of $309.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily from net income of $203.3 million,
compared with cash provided by operating activities of $286.3 million in 2018 and $235.4 million in 2017. The Company believes
its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities, available
borrowings under its $175.0 million revolving credit facility and $250.0 million term loan facility will be sufficient to finance
its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future.

The Company
settled its obligations under the Rollins, Inc. Pension Plan without making any additional contributions during the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. The plan was fully funded with a prepaid balance. The plan assets exceeded the plan benefit obligations,
and $31.8 million remained after the combination of lump sum payments to participants, the purchase of a group annuity contract,
and payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The Company has evaluated the ERISA allowable opportunities for utilization
of the excess pension assets including funding other employee benefits. The Company used $11.0 million of the $31.8 million to
fund its 401(k) match obligation during the year ended December 31, 2019, and plans to continue funding future benefit plan obligations,
with a possible reversion of any remaining pension assets to the Company per ERISA regulations.

The
Company has one small remaining pension in one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and made a contribution of $0.1 million during
the year ended December 31, 2019. No contributions were made during 2018 or 2017. While the Company’s management does not
expect to make a contribution to its remaining pension plan during fiscal year 2020, additional Plan contributions, if any, will
not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.


Cash
Used in Investing Activities

The Company
used $455.1 million in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $101.4 million and $154.2 million
during 2018 and 2017, respectively, and of that, invested approximately $27.1 million in capital expenditures during 2019 compared
to $27.2 million and $24.7 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily
of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology related projects. The Company expects to invest between $28 million
and $30 million in 2020 in capital expenditures. During 2019, the Company and its subsidiaries acquired Clark Pest Control as
well as several other small to mid-sized companies for a total of $430.6 million compared to $76.8 million and $130.2 million
in acquisitions during 2018 and 2017, respectively. The expenditures for the Company’s acquisitions were funded through
existing cash balances, borrowings on our line of credit, a term loan, and other operating cash flows. The Company continues to
seek new acquisitions.

Cash
From Financing Activities

The
Company generated cash of $127.7 million from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to using
$162.3 million and $130.3 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company borrowed $291.5 million throughout 2019, net of repayments,
primarily to fund the investing activities notes above. A total of
$153.8 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.47 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2019 including a special
dividend paid in December 2019 of $0.05 per share, compared to $152.7 million in cash dividends paid ($0.47 per share) during
the year ended December 31, 2018, including a special dividend paid in December 2018 of $0.09 per share and $122.0 million
paid in cash dividends ($0.37 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2017, including a special dividend paid in
December 2017 of $0.07 per share.

The Company
did not purchase shares on the open market during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. There remain 7.6 million shares,
adjusted for the December 10, 2018 three-for-two stock split, authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. The Company
repurchased $10.0 million, $9.5 million, and $8.2 million of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.

The Company’s
$94.3 million of total cash at December 31, 2019 is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $74.1 million
is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $20.2 million is primarily held in Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may
exceed federally insured amounts.

The Company’s
international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment
of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

Rollins
maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic
operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business.

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

The Company
views critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition
and results of operations, and that require management’s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances
that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual
for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors
that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number
of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible
to precisely predict future significant claims. Accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term
accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Accrued
Insurance—

The Company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’
compensation and vehicle liability. Risks above specified limits are managed through either high deductible insurance or a non-affiliated
group captive insurance member arrangement. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program
are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the
claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The
Company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability
based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with
management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s
judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical
information is not always an accurate indication of future events. The Company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management
to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. Initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment
screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random
and post incident drug testing, increased driver training and post-injury nurse triage for
work-related injuries.


Revenue
Recognition—

the Company’s Revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of
promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those
products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are
distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes
collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

More on
the Company’s revenue recognition policy can be found in the Company’s Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies with the heading Revenue Recognition.

Contingency
Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the
litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately
predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation
are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management,
the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.

Defined
benefit pension plans

— The Company had two defined benefit pension plans; the Rollins, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan
and the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan.

The Company ceased all future benefit
accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan, in 2005, but remained obligated to provide employees benefits earned
through June 2005. During 2018, the Company initiated the process to transition its pension plan to an insurance provider. At
December 31, 2018, the Company utilized a termination liability approach. This approach reflected the estimated impact of the
distribution of benefits due to a standard termination. Plan liabilities were to be settled through the purchase of annuities
from an insurance provider or through the distribution of lump sum payments to eligible participants that elected to receive such
a form of payment. Discount rates of 3.90% per year for participants in pay status and 4.11% per year for participants with deferred
benefits were selected by the plan sponsor to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination annuity purchases.
The discount rates reflected the single effective interest rate that produced the same present value as that produced when the
expected future cash flows for participants expected to elect an annuity were discounted with the FTSE Yield Curve (formerly Citigroup)
as of the measurement date. To determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination lump sum payments, the expected
future cash flows for lump sum eligible participants, determined with the IRC 417(e) Mortality Table for 2019, were discounted
with the IRC 417(e) segment interest rates for the month of November 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88%). Only 50% of active, 30% of
deferred vested, and 25% of retired participants that were eligible to receive a lump sum distribution of their pension benefit
upon plan termination, were assumed to elect this form of payment.

The
plan was settled during 2019 through a combination of lump sum payments to participants, the purchase of a group annuity contract,
and payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

The
Company’s sole remaining defined benefit pension plan is the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan. This Plan
was amended, effective September 1, 2018, to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants. The Company accounts for these
defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation- Retirement Benefits,” and engages an
outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant
assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors,
and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.


The Company
chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the
investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets
and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects
future pension expense. The Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from
the prior year.

Waltham
Services, LLC Hourly Employees Pension Plan utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the
Company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate
bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates
the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum
as the payments from the corporate bonds. The discount rate was 4.70% as of December 31, 2019 compared to 4.05% in both 2018 and
2017. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligation.

As set
forth in Note 16 to the Company’s financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan’s investments
are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These
investments are categorized as investments at net asset value (“NAV”) and are valued using significant non-observable
inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2009-12 “

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),”

these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These
valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect
valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’
judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

The Waltham
Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan had a net pension liability of $0.8 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2019 and
2018 respectively. The recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by $75.6
million before tax and $45.9 million after tax, driven mainly by the Rollins, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan settlement.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
Risk

The Company
maintained an investment portfolio (included in cash and cash equivalents) subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure.
The Company is subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175.0 million revolving credit facility and $250.0
million term loan facility. As of December 31, 2019, the revolving commitment had outstanding borrowings of $101.5 million and
the term loan had outstanding borrowings of $190.0 million. Additionally, the Company maintained $32.9 million in Letters of Credit.
These letters of credit are required by the Company’s fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s
self-insured status, to secure various workers’ compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes
that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims. The Company is also exposed
to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will
not have a material impact upon the Company’s results of operations going forward. For a discussion of the Company’s
activities to manage risks relative to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, see Note 11 to the accompanying financial
statements.


MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the
Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The management
of Rollins, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.
Rollins, Inc. maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost,
that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon
to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training
of qualified personnel. This system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls over
financial reporting, as of December 31, 2019 based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have elected to exclude our
wholly-owned subsidiary, Clark Pest Control of Stockton, Inc, a 2019 acquisition, from Management’s evaluation of
Internal Controls over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2019. This acquisition constituted 21.8% of total assets
as of December 31, 2019 and 4.7% of revenues for the year then ended. Refer to Notes 1 and 2 in the consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of this acquisition and its impact on Rollins, Inc.’s financial statements.
Management has commenced evaluation of the design of the internal control environment and expects to include this entity in
evaluation of ICFR effective December 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, management’s assessment is that Rollins, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.

The independent
registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2019, and has also issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting, included in this report on page 24.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Board
of Directors and Stockholders’

Rollins, Inc.

Opinion on internal
control over financial reporting

We have audited the internal control
over financial reporting of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our report dated February 28, 2020 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for opinion

The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audit of, and opinion on, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of Clark
Pest Control of Stockton, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting
21.8 and 4.7 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December
31, 2019. As indicated in Management’s Report, Clark Pest Control of Stockton, Inc. was acquired during 2019. Management’s
assertion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over
financial reporting of Clark Pest Control of Stockton, Inc.

Definition and
limitations of internal control over financial reporting

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE

Board
of Directors and Stockholders’

Rollins, Inc.

Opinion on the financial statements

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive earnings,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related
notes and financial statement schedule included under item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February
28, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Change in accounting principle

As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January
1, 2019, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842,

Leases

.

Basis for opinion

These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks
of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

Critical audit matters

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any
way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Business Combinations – Acquisition
of Clark Pest Control of Stockton, Inc.

As described further in Notes 1 and 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements, the company completed the acquisition of Clark Pest Control of Stockton, Inc. (“Clark”) on April 30, 2019.
The Company allocated the purchase price to the identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values.
We identified the Company’s determination of the fair value of the identified intangible assets acquired in the Clark acquisition
as a critical audit matter.

The principal considerations for our determination that the fair
value of identified intangible assets in the acquisition of Clark is a critical audit matter are because of the significant estimates
management makes to determine their fair value. This requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort,
including the need to involve our valuation specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s
assumptions related to the discount rates, customer attrition, and revenue growth projections.

Our audit procedures related to the determination of the fair
value of acquired intangible assets in the Clark acquisition included the following, among others. We tested the effectiveness
of controls relating to the accounting for the Clark acquisition, which included the models used to determine the fair value of
major classes of intangible assets along with any contingent consideration liabilities. We inspected the purchase agreement for
this acquisition. We utilized valuation specialists to assess the reasonableness of the significant assumptions utilized by management
within the models. We recalculated the calculation and support for the opening entry and subsequent recording of the entry for
the Clark acquisition.


Accrued Insurance

As described further in Note 1 to the financial statements, Rollins,
Inc. (the “Company”) retains, up to certain policy-specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’
compensation, and vehicle and equipment liability costs. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss
program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement
of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims.
We identified accrued insurance reserves and related expenses (“accrued insurance”) as a critical audit matter.

The principal considerations for our determination that accrued
insurance is a critical audit matter are that the accrual for accrued insurance has higher risk of estimation uncertainty due to
the loss development factors and inherent assumptions in actuarial methods used in determining the required reserves. The estimation
uncertainty and complexity of the actuarial methods utilized resulted in auditor judgment when assessing if management’s
accrual for accrued insurance was determined utilizing a reasonable basis and was materially correct.

Our audit procedures related to the accrued insurance reserves
included the following, among others:

•

We utilized a specialist in evaluating management’s methods
and assumptions to ensure the methods provided a reasonable basis for determining reserves including selected loss development
factors.

•

We performed a retrospective review of prior projections to current
projections to validate that changes in estimated ultimate losses were reasonable.

•

We reconciled claims data to the actuarial information and tested
a sample of underlying claims through review of accident reports, insurance claims and legal records to validate information utilized
by management in developing the accrual for accrued insurance was complete and accurate.

•

We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls
relating to accrued insurance, including, but not limited to, controls to (1) validate that claims were reported and submitted
accurately and timely, and (2) internal claims data were reconciled to claims data maintained by the third party administrator
and submitted to the Company’s actuary to validate information utilized by management in developing the accrual for accrued
insurance was complete and accurate.

Implementation
of ASC 842

As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements,
the Company adopted ASC 842, Leases, as of January 1, 2019 which resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset (“ROU
asset”) and a lease liability for operating leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease), at
the commencement of the lease term. The liability is equal to the present value of future lease payments. The asset will be based
on the liability, subject to certain adjustments, including initial direct costs and lessor provided incentives. We identified
adoption of ASC 842 as a critical audit matter driven primarily by the significant judgment in establishing the lease liability
and ROU asset – specifically the discount rate to apply to the future lease payments.

We identified the adoption of ASC 842 as a critical audit matter
because it is a substantial change in accounting for leases and as such requires significant auditor judgment in obtaining sufficient
and appropriate audit evidence related to management’s determination of the lease liability and ROU asset and their selection
of a discount rate to be applied to future lease payments.

Our audit procedures related to the adoption of ASC 842 include
the following, among others. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the initial adoption of ASC
842 and ongoing accounting for new leases obtained during the period. We evaluated the independent auditor’s report on operating
effectiveness of controls at the Company’s third party lease software vendor, which included testing the design and operating
effectiveness of the relevant user controls due to the Company’s reliance on the third party software to appropriately calculate
the related ROU asset and lease liability. We verified the completeness of the population of leases that management evaluated as
part of the initial impact of adoption and the on-going accounting. We inspected a sample of lease contracts, validated the relevant
inputs to the lease software, and recalculated the software’s calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. We performed
procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of the discount rate used by the Company in establishing the ROU asset and lease liability,
which included the use of a specialist to evaluate the reasonableness of the discount rate used by management in the initial measurement
of the lease liability.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business
Description

—Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”), was originally incorporated in 1948, under the laws of the
state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control
services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in the United States, Canada,
Australia, Europe, and Asia with international franchises in Mexico, Canada, Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Middle

arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, LLC.
(“Orkin”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite
control company. It provides customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin either serves customers directly or through franchise
operations, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and
Africa providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses,
including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under
the Orkin

®

, and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand
name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin Canada,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada’s largest pest
control provider and a leader in the development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western
Pest Services (“Western”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin
offers, focusing on the northeastern United States.

The Industrial
Fumigant Company (“IFC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam
Pest Defense (“HomeTeam”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins,
Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx

®

tubes in the wall pest control
system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services
home builders nationally.

Rollins
Australia (“Rollins Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”),
in February 2014. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional commercial,
residential, and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity
program and provides specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.

in 1983 and is headquartered in Traverse City, Michigan. The business is primarily franchised, operating in 40 states and one
Canadian province.

Rollins
UK was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to acquire Safeguard Pest Control (“Safeguard”) in June
2016. Safeguard is a pest control company established in the United Kingdom in 1991 with a history of providing superior pest
control, bird control, and specialist services to residential and commercial customers.

Northwest
Pest Control, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1951, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in August 2017. Northwest
specializes in residential and commercial termite control, pest control, mosquito control, wildlife services, lawn care, insulation,
and HVAC services, focusing on the Southeast United States.

On April
30, 2019, the Company acquired Clark Pest Control of Stockton, Inc. (“Clark Pest Control”) located in Lodi, CA. At
the time of the acquisition, Clark Pest Control was a leading pest management company in California and the nation’s 8th
largest pest management company according to PCT 100 rankings. Clark Pest Control services its customers from
26 service locations in 2 states. Clark Pest Control recorded revenues of approximately $139.2 million for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2018. The Company’s consolidated statements of income include the results of operations of Clark Pest Control
for the period beginning April 30, 2019 through December 31, 2019.

The Company
has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The Company
has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for
this segment, includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Asia, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, the
Middle East, and Africa. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single
customer, few customers or foreign operations.

Principles
of Consolidation

—The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include
the accounts of Rollins, Inc. and the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The Company does not consolidate the financial statements of any
company in which it has an ownership interest of 50% or less. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does
it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, the Company has not consolidated any variable
interest entity. The Company reclassified certain prior period amounts, none of which were material, to conform to the current
period presentation. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Subsequent
Events

—The Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued.

Estimates
Used in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

—The Company’s Revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised
products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products
or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct
and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected
from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Nature of
Goods and Services and Performance Obligations

The Company
contracts with its customers to provide the following goods and services, each of which is a distinct performance obligation:

Pest
control services -

Rollins provides pest control services to protect residential and commercial properties from common pests,
including rodents and insects. Pest control generally consists of assessing a customer’s property for conditions that invite
pests, tackling current infestations, and stopping the life cycle to prevent future invaders. Revenue from pest control services
is recognized as services are rendered.


The Company’s
revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues upon satisfaction of the performance obligation at the time services
are performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing
services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring
in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments
within a given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the
time services are performed. The Company defers recognition of advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are
rendered. The Company classifies discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite
control services (including traditional and baiting) -

Rollins provides both traditional and baiting termite protection services.
Traditional termite protection uses “Termidor” liquid treatment and/or dry foam and Orkin foam to treat voids and
spaces around the property, while baiting termite protection uses baits to disrupt the molting process termites require for growth
and offers ongoing protection. Revenue from initial termite treatment services is recognized as services are provided.

Maintenance/monitoring/inspection
-

In connection with the initial service offerings, Rollins provides recurring maintenance, monitoring or inspection services
to help protect consumer’s property for any future sign of termite activities after the original treatment. This recurring
service is a service-type warranty under ASC 606 as it is routinely sold and purchased separately from the initial treatment services
and is typically purchased or renewed annually.

Termite
baiting revenues are recognized based on the transfer of control of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a
new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation
of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion
of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring performance obligation. This portion is recognized as income
on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue that depicts the Company’s
performance in transferring control of the service. The allocation of the transaction price to the two deliverables is based on
the relative stand-alone selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other
specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line
basis that depicts the Company’s performance in transferring control of the service.

Revenue
received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term
that depicts the Company’s performance in transferring control of the service; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications
and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs
to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance of reinspections
tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts,
these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications
and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues
for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and
a provision is made for any expected losses.

Miscellaneous
services (e.g., cleaning, etc.) -

In certain agreements with customers, Rollins may offer other miscellaneous services, including
restroom cleaning (e.g., eliminating foul odors, grease and grime which could attract pests), training (e.g., seminars covering
good manufacturing practices and product stewardship), etc. Revenue from miscellaneous services is recognized when services are
provided.

Products
-

Depending on customer demand, Rollins may separately sell pest control and/or termite protection products, such as traps.
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of the asset.

Equipment
rental (or lease) -

Depending on customer demand, Rollins may lease certain pest control and/or termite protection equipment.
Revenue from equipment rentals are recognized over the period of the rental/lease. Revenue from equipment rentals represent less
than 1.0% of the Company’s revenues for each reported period.

Right
to access intellectual property (Franchise) -

The right to access Rollins’ intellectual property is an essential part
of Orkin’s franchising agreements. These agreements provide the franchisee (the customer) a license to use the Rollins’
name and trademark when advertising and selling services to end customers in their normal course of business. Orkin franchise
agreements contain a clause allowing Orkin to purchase certain assets of the franchisee. This is only an offer for Orkin to re-purchase
the assets originally provided by Orkin to the franchisee and is not a performance obligation or a form of consideration. International
and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1.0% of the Company’s annual revenues.


All Orkin
domestic franchises have a guaranteed repurchase clause that the Orkin franchise may be repurchased by Orkin at a later date once
it has been established. The Company amortizes the initial franchise fee over the initial franchise term. Deferred Orkin franchise
fees were $

1.7

million and $

1.6

million for the year ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Royalties
from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues are earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from Orkin franchises was
$

8.7

million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $

8.8

million and $

5.4

million for the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively.

Contract
Balances

Timing of
revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record unearned revenue when revenue is recognized
subsequent to billing. Unearned revenue mainly relates to the Company’s termite baiting offering, conventional renewals,
and year-in-advance pest control services for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control
of the product or service. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual
coverage period. Refer to Note 3 - Revenue for further information, including changes in unearned revenue for the year.

The Company
extends terms to certain customers on higher dollar termite and ancillary work, as well as to certain franchisees for initial
funding on the sale of franchises. These financed receivables are segregated from our trade receivables. The amounts that are
due within one year from the balance sheet dates are classified as short-term financed receivables, and are shown, net of allowance
for doubtful accounts, at $22.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and $18.5 million at December 31, 2018. The balances of long-term
financed receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, were $30.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and $28.2 million at
December 31, 2018 and are included in long-term assets on our consolidated statements of financial position. See Note 6 –
Financing Receivables for further information.

The allowance
for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine
the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the
allowance for doubtful accounts can be found on Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.

Payment
terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In
instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally
do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified
and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers
with financing.

Practical
Expedients and Exemptions

We generally
expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded
within sales and marketing expenses.

We do not
disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less
and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
All revenues are reported net of sales taxes.

The Company’s
foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability
of accounts receivable.  Management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine
the expected collectability of accounts receivable.  Substantially all of the Company’s receivables are due from pest
control and termite services in the United States and selected international locations.  The Company’s allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability.
The Company’s established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk
customers. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written-off
against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible, and recoveries of amounts
previously written off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the
period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. There were
no large recoveries in 2019, 2018, and 2017.  We record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer’s inability
to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating
results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables
would be further adjusted, either upward or downward. See Recent Accounting Guidance for discussion of the new FASB, ASU 2016-13
which provides updated guidance on measuring expected credit losses to be implemented in 2020.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

— The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates
fair market value.

The Company’s
$94.3 million of total cash at December 31, 2019, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $74.1
million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $20.2 million is primarily held in Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times
may exceed federally insured amounts.

The Company’s
international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment
of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

Rollins
maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic
operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business for the foreseeable future.

Marketable
Securities

— From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial
institutions. The Company’s investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than “investment
grade” by national rating services.

Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of
each balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to
hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and
losses reported as in earnings.

The Company
had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined benefit pension plan and the non-qualified deferred compensation
plan at December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 16 for further details.

Materials
and Supplies

— Materials and supplies are stated at the lower cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on
the first-in, first-out method.


Income
Taxes

—The Company provides for income taxes based on FASB ASC topic 740 “Income Taxes”, which requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The Company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it determines
that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. The Company establishes additional provisions
for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not
meet the minimum probability threshold. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters
in income tax expense.

Equipment
and Property

— Equipment and Property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are provided principally
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are computed
using the following asset lives: buildings, 10 to 40 years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, 2 to 10 years. Expenditures
for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from
the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. The annual provisions for
depreciation, below, have been reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

— In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 350,

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”

,
the Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization;
(2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. The Company does not amortize intangible
assets with indefinite lives or goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic
downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the Company
level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with
its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, then the Company will compare the
implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill
is less than its carrying value.  The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing
the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge
if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its most recent annual impairment
analysis as of September 30, 2019. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its
goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

-

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 360,

“Property, Plant and Equipment”

,
the Company’s long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair
value of the asset. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets,
including customer contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Accrued
Insurance

—The Company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’
compensation and vehicle liability. Risks above specified limits are managed through either high deductible insurance or a non-affiliated
group captive insurance member arrangement. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program
are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the
claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The
Company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability
based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with
management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s
judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical
information is not always an accurate indication of future events.


Accrual
for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors
that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual
number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible
to precisely predict future significant claims. An accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and
long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Contingency
Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.
In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

management estimates and accrues for its liability
and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because
it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities
and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued.
However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued
liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Three-for-two
stock split

—The Board of Directors at its quarterly meeting on October 23, 2018, authorized a three-for-two stock
split by the issuance on December 10, 2018 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at November
9, 2018. All share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are restated for the
three-for-two stock split.

Earnings
Per Share

—the FASB ASC Topic 260-10

“Earnings Per Share-Overall,”

requires a basic earnings per
share and diluted earnings per share presentation. Further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is
required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.

The Company
has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered
participating securities. See Note 17 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.

The basic
and diluted calculations are the same as there were no stock options included in diluted earnings per share as we have no stock
options outstanding. Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the respective periods.


A reconciliation

weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common stock

(participating
securities) is as follows (in thousands except per share data). All share and per share information in the following chart are

Translation
of Foreign Currencies

—Assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated
into U.S. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates
for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from
foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign
currency are included in the earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based
Compensation

— The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718 “

Compensation
– Stock Compensation

.” Time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management
employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan.

TLRSs provide
for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated
number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. Outstanding TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting
with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends
declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that
shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed. The fair value
of these awards is recognized as compensation expense, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years.

Comprehensive
Income (Loss)

—Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) results from foreign currency translations, minimum pension liability
adjustments and cash flow hedge of interest rate risks.


Franchising
Program

– Rollins’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, had


,


and


domestic franchises as of December 31,
2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Transactions with Orkin’s domestic franchises involve sales of customer contracts to
establish new Orkin franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts and initial Orkin franchise fees
are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods ranging up to

five

years. Notes receivable from Orkin
franchises were $

6.7

million at December 31, 2019 and $

6.5

million at December 31, 2018. The Company amortizes the initial
domestic franchise fees over the initial franchise term. Deferred domestic Orkin franchise fees were $1.7 million at December
31, 2019 and $1.6 million December 31, 2018. These notes receivable are included as financing receivables and the deferred franchise
fees are included in other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company’s
maximum exposure to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to Orkin’s domestic franchises
was $

5.0

million, $

4.9

million, and $

2.5

million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

As of December 31,
2019, 2018 and 2017, Orkin had


,


, and


international franchises, respectively. Orkin’s international franchise program
began with its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean,
the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Africa.

Royalties
from Orkin franchises (domestic and international) are accrued and recognized as revenues and are earned on a monthly basis. Revenue
from Orkin franchises was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $8.8 million and $5.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Rollins’
wholly-owned subsidiary, Critter Control, had


,


and


franchises in the United States and Canada as of December 31,
2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Transactions with Critter Control franchises involve sales of territories to establish new
franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The territories and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination
of cash and notes. Notes receivable from Critter Control franchises were $

0.9

million and $

0.6

million at December 31, 2019
and 2018, respectively. These notes are not guaranteed.  The Company anticipates that should there be any losses from franchisees,
these losses would be recouped by terminating the franchisee and re-selling the territory. These amounts are included as financing
receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Combined
domestic and international revenues from Orkin, Critter Control and Australia franchises were $

17.1

million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and $

14.7

million and $

9.7

million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total franchising
revenues were less than 1.0% of the Company’s annual revenues.

Right
to access intellectual property (Franchise)

- The right to access Orkin’s and Critter Control’s intellectual property
is an essential part of Orkin and Critter Control franchising agreements, respectively. These agreements provide the franchisee
a license to use the brand name and trademark when advertising and selling services to end customers in their normal course of
business. Orkin and Critter Control franchise agreements contain a clause allowing the respective franchisor to purchase certain
assets of the franchisee at the conclusion of their franchise agreement or upon termination. This is only an option for the franchisor
to re-purchase the assets selected by the franchisor and is not a performance obligation or a form of consideration.

Recent
Accounting Guidance

Recently
adopted accounting standards

The Company
adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and did not restate comparative
periods as permitted by ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. We have elected the transition package of practical
expedients, which permitted us not to reassess our prior conclusions regarding lease identification, lease classification and
initial direct cost. The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We elected
the short-term lease recognition exemption. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize right of use assets or lease liabilities,
for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. Upon adoption, the Company recognized operating lease right-of-use
assets and liabilities of $195.7 million and $195.5 million, and a $0.2 million adjustment to beginning retained earnings.

The Company
adopted ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (ASC 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects
from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income
to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform Act”).
The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 effective January 1, 2019 and elected not to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment.

In August
2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which provides new guidance intended to improve the financial
reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its
financial statements. This ASU was adopted by the Company in 2019. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.


Recently
issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2020 or later

In June
of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments.” The updated accounting guidance requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses
for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable
forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets,
including trade receivables. Based on our current receivables and forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions, we estimate that
the allowance for credit losses reported in our consolidated balance sheet will decrease by an immaterial amount at adoption.
We will record the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings.

In January
2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,
which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment
test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting
unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on the current Step 1). The standard in this
update is effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning in 2020. Early adoption is
permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In August
2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements
for Fair Value Measurement. The updated accounting guidance modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements by
removing certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifying existing disclosure requirements related
to measurement uncertainty and adding new disclosure requirements. The standard in this update is effective for the Company’s
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning in 2020. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS

The Company
has made 30 and 38 acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively, some of which have been
disclosed on various press releases and related Current Reports on Form 8-K.

Acquisition
of Clark Pest Control:

The Company
completed the acquisition of Clark Pest Control on April 30, 2019. Clark Pest Control is a leading pest management company in
California and was the nation’s 8th largest pest management company according to PCT 100 rankings at the time of the acquisition,
making it the largest Rollins acquisition since the Company acquired HomeTeam Pest Defense in 2008. Clark Pest Control services
its customers from 26 service locations in 2 states. Clark Pest Control recorded revenues of approximately $139.2 million for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Company’s consolidated statements of income include the results of operations
of Clark Pest Control for the period beginning April 30, 2019 through December 31, 2019.

The Company
engaged an independent valuation firm to determine the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and identifiable intangible
assets. The valuation resulted in the allocation of $191.9 million to goodwill, $112.7 million to customer contracts, and $49.8
million to other intangible assets, principally tradenames. The finite-lived intangible assets, principally customer contracts,
are being amortized over periods principally ranging from 5 to 10 years on a straight-lined basis.

REVENUE

Adoption
of ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified
retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods
beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported
in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC 605.

There was
no material impact on the Company’s financial statements as a result of adopting ASC 606 for the twelve months ended December
31, 2018.

The following
tables present our revenues disaggregated by revenue source (in thousands, unaudited).

Sales and
usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. No sales to an individual customer or in a country other than the United States
accounted for more than 10% of the sales for the periods listed on the following table.

13.7

million and $

11.1

million, respectively. Unearned
short-term revenue is recognized over the next 12-month period. The majority of unearned long-term revenue is recognized over
a period of five years or less with immaterial amounts recognized through 2025.

DEBT

The
Company entered into a new Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured Revolving
Commitment of up to $

175.0

million, which includes a $

75.0

million letter of credit subfacility and a $

25.0

million swingline subfacility and an unsecured variable rate $

250.0

million Term Loan with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. Both the Revolving Commitment and the Term Loan have five-year
durations commencing on April 29, 2019. In addition, the agreement has provisions to extend the duration beyond the Revolving
Commitment Termination date as well as optional prepayments rights at any time and from time to time to prepay any borrowing,
in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. As of December 31, 2019, the Revolving Commitment had outstanding borrowings
of $

101.5

million and the Term Loan had outstanding borrowings of $

190.0

million. As of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings. The $

291.5

million outstanding borrowings value approximated the fair value at December 31, 2019 based upon interest rates available to
the Company as evidenced by debt of other companies with similar credit characteristics. Our effective interest rate on the
debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was 2.66%. The effective interest rate is comprised of the 1-month LIBOR plus a
margin of 87.5 basis points as determined by our leverage ratio calculation.

maintains approximately $

million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company’s fronting
insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured status, to secure various workers’ compensation
and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance
accruals to accommodate such claims.

In
order to comply with applicable debt covenants, the Company is required to maintain at all times a Leverage Ratio of not
greater than 3.00:1.00. The Leverage ratio is calculated as of the last day of the fiscal quarter most recently ended.

The Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2019 and expects to maintain compliance
throughout 2020.


5.

TRADE RECEIVABLES

The
allowance for doubtful accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency
aging totals, based on contractual terms, for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company
policies that are specific to pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

Rollins
manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. The Company’s
credit risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising Rollins’ customer base and dispersion across
many different geographical regions. The credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on
an assessment of the individual’s Beacon/credit bureau score. Rollins requires a potential obligor to have good credit
worthiness with low risk before entering into a contract. Depending upon the individual’s credit score, the Company may
accept with


%

financing
or require a significant down payment or turndown the contract. Delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. Financing
receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet
dates.

$

Total financing receivables,
net were $53.1 million and $46.7 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Financing receivables are generally
charged-off when deemed uncollectable or when


days have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment. The Company’s
charge-off policy has been consistently applied during the periods reported. Management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating
the appropriateness of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Gross charge-offs as a percentage of average financing receivables
were

5.0

% and

3.8

% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Due to the low percentage
of charge-off receivables and the high credit worthiness of the potential obligor, the entire Rollins, Inc. financing receivables
portfolio has a low credit risk.

The Company
offers


days same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their credit worthiness. Interest is not recognized until the
91st day at which time it is recognized retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. In certain
circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest when they
reach


days past due. As of December 31, 2019, there were seven accounts that were greater than 180 days past due, which have
been fully reserved.

Included
in financing receivables are notes receivable from franchise owners. The majority of these notes are low risk as the
repurchase of these franchises is guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin Systems, LLC, and the
repurchase price of the franchise is currently estimated and has historically been well above the receivable due from the
franchise owner. Also included in notes receivables are franchise notes from other brands which are not guaranteed and do not
have the same historical valuation.

The carrying
amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of contracts.
Long-Term Installment receivables, net were $30.8 million and $28.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.


Rollins
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The
allowance balance is comprised of a general reserve, which is determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance,
and a specific reserve, which is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy
or other events, that make it unlikely that Rollins will recover its investment. The general reserve percentages are based on
several factors, which include consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted-average
risk rating of the portfolio and information derived from competitive benchmarking.

FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company’s
financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable,
and other short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values. The Company
has financial instruments related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed in Note 16.

The fair
value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values
determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant
other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.

At December
31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, the Company had $49.1 million and $30.9 million of acquisition holdback and earnout liabilities
with the former owners of acquired companies. The earnout liabilities were discounted to reflect the expected probability of payout,
and both earnout and holdback liabilities were discounted to their net present value on the Company’s books and are considered
level 3 liabilities.

The table below presents a summary of the changes in fair value for these liabilities.

CONTRACTS, TRADENAMES AND TRADEMARKS, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Customer
contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio
that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance
with the FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles - Goodwill and other”, the expected lives of customer contracts were reviewed,
and it was determined that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of


to

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Risk Management Objective
of Using Derivatives

The Company
is exposed to certain interest rate risks on our outstanding debt and foreign currency risks arising from our international business
operations and global economic conditions. The Company enters into certain derivative financial instruments to lock in certain
interest rates, as well as to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional currency,
the U.S. dollar.

Cash
Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company
uses interest rate swap arrangements to manage or hedge its interest rate risk. Notwithstanding the terms of the swaps, the Company
is ultimately obligated for all amounts due and payable under the Revolving Commitment and the Term Loan (“Credit Facility”).
The Company does not use such instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

On June
19, 2019, the Company entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap for an aggregate notional amount of $80.0 million in
order to hedge a portion of the Company’s floating rate indebtedness under the Credit Facility. The Company designated the
swap as a cash flow hedge. The swap requires us to pay a fixed rate of 1.94% per annum on the notional amount. The cash flows
from the swap began June 30, 2019 and ends on December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2019, $0.3  million had been recorded
as an Accumulated Loss in Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”). Realized gains and losses in connection with each required
interest payment are reclassified from AOCI to interest expense during the period of the cash flows. During 2019, $0.1  million
was recorded as interest income to offset the floating rate interest expense on our Credit Facility. On a quarterly basis, management
evaluates any swap agreement to determine its effectiveness or ineffectiveness and records the change in fair value as an adjustment
to AOCI. Management intends that the swap remains effective. No swaps existed at December 31, 2018.

Hedges
of Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company
is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency, the US dollar. We use foreign currency
derivatives, specifically vanilla foreign currency forward contracts (“FX Forwards”), to manage our exposure to fluctuations
in the USD-CAD and AUD-USD exchange rates. FX Forwards involve fixing the foreign currency exchange rate for delivery of a specified
amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The FX Forwards are typically settled in US dollars for their fair value at or
close to their settlement date. We do not currently designate any of these FX Forwards under hedge accounting, but rather reflect
the changes in fair value immediately in earnings. We do not use such instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but rather
use them to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of FX Forwards recorded in other income/expense
and were equal to a net loss of $0.4  million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and a net gain of $0.5  million
in 2018. The fair value of the Company’s FX Forwards was recorded in Other Current Liabilities as a net obligation of $0.2
million at December 31, 2019 and in Other Assets of $0.1 million at December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2019, the

On
December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law. The TCJA reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to
21% and made numerous other tax law changes. In 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 which permitted the
recording of provisional amounts related to the impact of the TCJA during a measurement period not to exceed one year. A
provisional amount based on reasonable estimates was made with respect to the tax implications associated with the deemed
repatriated earnings on foreign subsidiaries based on the initial analysis of the TCJA. Certain tax effects of the TCJA were
recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in the recording of $

11.6

million of additional tax expense. The additional tax of $11.6 million related to the following components: $

8.0

million related to the imposition of a tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries due to implementation of a
territorial tax system, $

2.9

million related to re-measurement of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax rate, and $

0.7

million related to reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation. During 2018, the Company completed the analysis of
earnings and profits of foreign investments. This resulted in the recognition at year ended December 31, 2018 of an
additional $1.2 million related to the imposition of a tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The
Company has elected to include the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) as part of tax expense in the year
incurred.

The Provision
for Income Taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of

22.1

% on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The effective rate differs from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes and beneficial
adjustments related to the pension settlement.

For 2018
the effective tax rate was

25.4

%. The effective rate differs from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state
and foreign income taxes, tax benefits associated with restricted stock and adjustments due to the TCJA.


For 2017
the effective tax rate was

39.2

%. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because
of state and foreign income taxes, adjustments due to the TCJA partially offset by tax benefits associated with restricted stock,
and the increase of available foreign tax credits.

During 2019,
2018 and 2017, the Company paid income taxes of $75.8 million, $77.3 million and $90.7 million, respectively, net of refunds.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes.

As of December
31, 2019, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately $

85.3

million,
which will be available to offset future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2020 and 2032. Management
believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $

0.4

million of foreign net operating losses before they expire
and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance
increased by $

0.04

million due to foreign net operating losses.

Earnings
from continuing operations before income tax included foreign income of $

26.7

million in 2019, $

22.7

million in 2018 and $

22.1

million in 2017. The Company’s international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign
markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisition of unrelated companies.
Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not part of the Company’s current business plan.


The total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $0.8 million.

The Company
and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various state and international jurisdictions that are currently under audit for
years ranging from 2012 through 2018. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S.,
income tax examinations for years prior to 2012.

It is reasonably
possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next 12 months.

The Company’s
policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties
were $

0.03

million and $

1.0

million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2019 the Company recognized interest
and penalties of $

0.1

million.

ACCRUAL
FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In accordance
with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing
the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative
to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

LEASES

The Company
leases certain buildings, vehicles, and equipment in order to reduce the risk associated with ownership. The Company elected the
practical expedient approach permitted under ASC 842 not to include short-term leases with a duration of 12 months or less on
the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, all leases were classified as operating leases. Building leases generally
carry terms of 5 to 10 years with annual rent escalations at fixed amounts per the lease. Vehicle leases generally carry a fixed
term of one year with renewal options to extend the lease on a monthly basis resulting in lease terms up to 5 years depending
on the class of vehicle. The exercise of renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. It is reasonably certain that
the Company will exercise the renewal options on its vehicle leases. The measurement of right-of-use assets and liabilities for
vehicle leases includes the fixed payments associated with such renewal periods. We separate lease and non-lease components of
contracts. Our lease agreements do not contain any material variable payments, residual value guarantees, early termination penalties
or restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no additional future obligations for leases that had not yet
commenced.

The Company
uses the rate implicit in the lease when available; however, most of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit
rate. Accordingly, we estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at lease commencement.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

In the normal
course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases
and claims from time to time, which may include claims on a representative or class action basis alleging wage and hour law violations.
We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. We are actively contesting
each of these matters.

Management
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual quarter or year.

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS

Defined
Benefit Pension Plans

Rollins,
Inc. Retirement Income Plan

The Company
maintained several noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”) covering employees meeting
certain age and service requirements. The Plans provide benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five years
during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated Social
Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plans with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company made a
contribution of $0.1 million to the Plans for the year ended December 31, 2019 and no contribution for the years ended December
31, 2018 and 2017.

In 2005,
the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan, although the Company remains obligated
to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005.  In September 2019, the Company settled its fully-funded pension
plan through a combination of lump sum payments to participants, payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the
purchase of a group annuity contract. With the completed funding of the plan payout settlements, the Company had approximately
$31.8 million of pension assets remaining. The remaining assets were the result of the funded status of the plan, higher take
rate of lump sum payment election by participants and optimal pricing of the group annuity contract. The Company has evaluated
the ERISA allowable opportunities for utilization of the excess pension assets including funding other employee benefits. The
Company used $11.0 million of the $31.8 million to fund its 401(k) match obligation during the year ended December 31, 2019, and
plans to continue funding future benefit plan obligations with a possible reversion of any remaining pension assets to the Company
per ERISA regulations. The Company recognized a $49.9 million non-cash pension settlement expense from this transition, which
is the accounting treatment of the accumulated sum of unrealized losses due to change in actuarial assumptions over the life of
the plan. Net of tax, the expense was $26.6 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $21.6 million remaining
of benefit plan assets.

The Company
includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan in the Company’s financial statements. The Waltham Services,
LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan was amended, effective September 1, 2018, to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants.
The Company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation- Retirement
Benefits,” and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the
Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the
discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.


The Company
currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for its defined benefit post-retirement plans.

The funded status of the
Plans and the net amount recognized in the statement of financial position

are summarized as follows as of:

The accumulated
benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans were $2.8 million and $208.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively. Accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the same for the Plans. In 2019 and
2017, pension liability pre-tax decreases of $

75.4

million and $

19.0

million, respectively, were credited, net of tax, to other
comprehensive income. In 2018, the pre-tax increase of $

other comprehensive income.

In 2018, the Company used a
termination liability approach in calculating the 2018 discount rate for the Rollins, Inc. Pension plan. The following assumptions
were used 1) 3.90%, based on current market conditions, for participants in pay status expected to elect a plan termination annuity;
2) 4.11%, based on current market conditions, for active and terminated participants with deferred benefits expected to elect
a plan termination annuity; 3) The IRC 417(e) interest rates for the month of November 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88%), based on
plan provisions, for all lump sum eligible expected to elect a plan termination lump sum. The Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee
Pension Plan applied 4.05% discount rate based on yield curve analysis.


The return
on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments
held in the plan. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns
on the plan investments.

The discount
rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year.  In
estimating this rate, the Company utilized a yield curve analysis for the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan for
fiscal year’s 2019, 2018 and 2017. For the Rollins, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan, the Company utilized a termination liability
approach for fiscal year 2018 and settled the plan in 2019.

For each
of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of return
on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The investment
policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans utilize a number of investment
approaches, including individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable,
and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. The Company and management are not considering making contributions to the remaining
pension plan during fiscal 2020.

Some of
our assets, primarily our private equity

,

real estate, and hedge funds, do not have readily
determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. 
For the December 31, 2018 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible.  For assets without
readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager statements combined with discussions focusing on underlying
fundamentals and significant events.

Additionally, these investments are categorized
as NAV investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. 
In accordance with ASU No. 2011-12 “Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),”
these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These
valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect
valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’
judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

Fair
Value Measurements

Given
the funded status of the Rollins, Inc. Plan, the Company has modified the overall investment strategy to mitigate risk related
to volatility with asset types by transitioning to a higher percentage of fixed income securities. As such, the Company’s
overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 50 percent of investments to match long-term pension obligations
and 50 percent for near term benefits payments, with a diversification of assets types, fund strategies and fund managers. With
the modification of investment strategy, the Company has transitioned the majority of its assets to Fixed-income securities. Fixed-income
securities include corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds, and U.S. Treasuries. Equity securities primarily
include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies domiciled domestically and internationally. Other types of investments
include real estate funds and private equity funds that follow several different investment strategies. For each of the asset
categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets
with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The investment policy establishes
a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required.  The plans utilize a number of investment approaches,
including but not limited to individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are
marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation.

Defined
Contribution 401(k) Savings Plan

The
Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) Savings Plan that is available to a majority of the Company’s
full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following completion of

three
months

of service. The Plan is available to non-full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following

one
year

of service upon completion of

1,000 hours

in that year.  The Plan changed for 2018 and beyond to provide for a matching contribution of one dollar
($1.00) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant’s contributions to the Plan that do not exceed 3 percent of his or
her eligible compensation (which include commissions, overtime, and bonuses) and

fifty

cents ($0.50) for each

one

dollar ($1.00) of a participant’s contributions to the Plan over the initial 3 percent that do not exceed 6 percent
of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses), up from a matching contribution of
fifty cents ($0.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant’s contributions to the Plan that do not exceed


percent of his or her eligible compensation (which include commissions, overtime and bonuses) in 2017. The charge to
expense for the Company match was approximately $

25.5

million and $

21.1

million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $

11.0

million for the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 approximately,

,

,
and

respectively of the plan assets consisted of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total administrative fees paid by the Company
for the Plan were less than $

0.1

million for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.


Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan

The Deferred
Compensation Plan provides that participants may defer up to


%

of their base salary and up to


%

of their annual bonus with
respect to any given plan year, subject to a $


thousand per plan year minimum. The Company may make discretionary contributions
to participant accounts but has not done so since 2011.

Accounts
will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain “Measurement
Funds.” Account values are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and Company credits had been converted into shares
or other ownership units of selected Measurement Funds by purchasing (or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the
current purchase price of the relevant Measurement Fund at the time of the participant’s selection. Deferred Compensation
Plan benefits are unsecured general obligations of the Company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with
the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company has established a “rabbi trust,”
which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to indirectly fund any obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the
extent that the Company’s obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan exceed assets available under the trust, the
Company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Generally,
the Deferred Compensation Plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant’s
death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment (a “Termination Event”). However, for any deferrals
of salary and bonus (but not Company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is
prior to a Termination Event. Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions
under the Deferred Compensation Plan in installments or lump-sum payments.

At December 31,
2019, the Deferred Compensation Plan had


life insurance policies with a net face value of $

47.4

million. The cash surrender
value of these life insurance policies was worth $

22.0

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION

Stock
Compensation Plans

Time
Lapse Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units

Time lapse
restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company’s Employee Stock
Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding over the remainder
of the service period. The compensation cost recorded for these awards is based on their closing stock price at the grant date
less the cost of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
periods to reflect actual forfeitures.

TLRSs provide
for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated
number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. TLRSs vest in


percent increments starting with the
second anniversary of the grant, over

six years

from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared
and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the one-time grant of restricted stock is issued provide
that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

In April
2018, the Company granted a one-time issuance of TLRSs on a tiered Company tenure basis to U.S. based employees. The one-time
grant vested 100 percent on the first anniversary date of the granted shares. The total shares granted were less than 0.1 million
shares. During the year, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements
under which the one-time restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until
restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

All share
and per share information has been adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective December 10, 2018.

The Company
issued time lapse restricted shares of

0.5

million

,

0.6

million

, and

0.7

million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

The Company
issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2019, approximately

5.5

million shares of
the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718, “

Compensation
– Stock Compensation,”

the Company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the service
periods of each award. The Company estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.
