PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and
commercial customers in North America with international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe. Services are performed through a contract
that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, LLC.
("Orkin"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is one of the world's largest pest and termite control companies. It provides customized services from over 400
locations. Orkin serves customers, either directly or indirectly through franchises, in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe
providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers,
retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the Orkin®, and PCO Services, Inc.® trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The
Orkin® brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The PCO Services brand name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

PCO
Services ("PCO"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. PCO Services is Canada's largest pest control provider and a leader in the development of fast,
effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western
Pest Services ("Western"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service
company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers focusing on the northeastern United States.

The
Industrial Fumigant Company ("IFC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and
sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam
Pest Defense ("HomeTeam"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its
unique Taexx in the wall system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders nationally.

The
Company has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company's total revenues.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, which includes the United States, Canada,
Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe are included in Item 8 of this document, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" on pages 37 and
38. The Company's results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company's foreign operations.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company repurchased 1.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $13.95 with
2.5 million shares repurchased in 2009 at a weighted average price of $11.03. In total, there are 2.5 million additional shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval.



The
program does not have an expiration date. All share and per share repurchases are adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock split effective December 10, 2010.

Backlog

Backlog services and orders are usually provided within the month following the month of order receipt, except in the area of prepaid pest control
and bait monitoring services, which are usually provided within twelve months of order receipt. The Company does not have a material portion of its business that may be subject to renegotiation of
profits or termination of contracts at the election of a governmental entity.

Orkin Franchises

The Company continues to expand its growth through Orkin's franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently
not economically feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are subject to a contractual buyback provision at Orkin's option with a pre-determined purchase price
using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise. International franchises have no contractual buyback provision. The Company through its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary began its Orkin franchise
program in the U.S. in 1994, and established its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe.

Seasonality

The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company's pest and termite control services. The increase in pest pressure and
activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in
the revenue of the Company's pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The Company has a relationship with a national pest control product distributor and other vendors for pest and termite control treatment products.
Rollins maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability
from its national network of suppliers.

Competition

The Company believes that Rollins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, PCO Services, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest Services, The
Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services and TruTech competes favorably with competitors as one of the world's largest pest and termite control companies. The Company's
competitors include Terminix, Ecolab and Rentokil.

The
principal methods of competition in the Company's pest and termite control business are quality of service and guarantees, including money-back guarantees on pest and termite control,
and the termite re-treatment and damage repair guarantee to qualified homeowners.

Research and Development

Expenditures by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and
improved service methods and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies. Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the
specifications provided by the Company.

The
Company maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.

The
Company conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products. The Company also works closely with leading entomologists, industry consultants and suppliers to improve
service protocols and materials.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

The Company's pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment, public
health and consumers. Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act ("FIFRA")

This federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control
companies operate. Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the following: licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training
and registration of products. This allows each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens' wishes in each state. The pest
control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 ("FQPA")

The FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts its
business.



Environmental Remediation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as Superfund, is the primary Federal statute
regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of
hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous substances, and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will work with the EPA
and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Consistent with the Company's responsibilities under these regulations, the Company
undertakes environmental assessments and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these situations arise, the Company
accrues management's best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management's current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the Company's
financial condition or operating results.

Employees

The number of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2011 was approximately 10,300.

and amendments to these reports, are available free of charge on our web site at www.rollins.com as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1.A.    Risk Factors

We may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the competitive pest control industry in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitive prices, and general economic issues.
We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the
market areas that we serve are service quality and product and availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe that our experience and
reputation for safety and quality service is excellent, we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.

Economic conditions may adversely affect our business

Pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to most of our residential customers. As consumers restrict their discretionary
expenditures, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and
food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or
cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.

We may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify and
acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to



us
in the future. We cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Any inability on our part to integrate and
manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

Our operations are directly affected by the weather conditions across the United States and Canada. The business of the Company is affected by the
seasonal nature of the Company's pest and termite control services. The increase in pest pressure and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of
which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company's pest and termite control operations during such
periods. The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods.

Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand
our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees is high, and the supply is very limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by
competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in our wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and profitability could be
diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

Our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.

In the normal course of business, some of the Company's subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that
plaintiffs have been damaged. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual
year.

Our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws
and the level of
enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings,
or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted. We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations. We also believe
that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental
laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective
actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.

The Company's Management Has a Substantial Ownership Interest; Public Stockholders May Have No Effective Voice In the Company's Management

The Company has elected the "Controlled Company" exemption under rule 303A of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Company Guide. The Company
is a "Controlled Company" because a group that includes the Company's Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins and his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the President, Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Operating Officer, also a director of the Company and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company's voting power. As a "Controlled Company," the
Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.



Rollins, Inc.'s
executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 57 percent of the Company's
outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate
transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from
acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Item 1.B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None

Item 2.    Properties.

The Company's administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The Company
owns or leases over 500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins Training Center located in Atlanta, Georgia, the Rollins Customer Service Center located in
Covington, Georgia, and the Pacific Division Administration and Training Center in Riverside, California. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important
physical property of the Company. The facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of business, certain of the Company's subsidiaries, are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that
plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services by the defendant subsidiary and other matters. The subsidiaries are actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits have been
filed (

John Maciel v. Orkin, Inc., et al.

;

Douglas F. Bracho, Jr.

v.

Orkin, Inc.; Khan v. Orkin, Inc., et.al.; John Urbino v. Orkin Services of California, Inc. and Rollins, Inc.; and
Jennifer Thompson and Janet Flood v. Philadelphia Management Company, Parkway Associated, Parkway House Apartments, Barbara Williams, and Western Pest Services

)
in which the plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class. The cases originate in California and Pennsylvania, respectively. The

Maciel

lawsuit, a wage and hour related matter, was filed in
the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California and a new
date for a class certification hearing has not been scheduled. The

Bracho

lawsuit, a matter related to payroll deductions
for use of Company vehicles, was filed in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Khan

suit, a termite service related
matter, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Urbino

lawsuit, a wage and hour related
matter, was filed in the Superior Court of Orange County, California. It has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Flood

lawsuit, a bed bug service related matter filed by
residents of an apartment complex, was filed in late August 2009
in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The Company believes these matters are without merit and intends to
vigorously contest certification and defend itself through trial or arbitration, if necessary. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the
matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

Orkin
is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company's liability under any of these matters would not and
did not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 4.A.    Executive Officers of the Registrant.

Each of the executive officers of the Company was elected by the Board of Directors to serve until the Board of Directors' meeting immediately
following the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until his



earlier
removal by the Board of Directors or his resignation. The following table lists the executive officers of the Company and their ages, offices with the Company, and the dates from which they

General Operating Comments

2010 marked the Company's 13th consecutive year of reporting improved results, with 2010 concluding with record revenues and profits. Last
year (2010) the Company revenue grew 5.9%, with growth in all lines of service.

Results of Operations—2010 Versus 2009

Overview

The Company's gross margin remained flat at 48.7% for 2010 and 2009. Sales, general and administrative expense showed an improvement in 2010 lowering
to 32.8% of revenue versus 33.1% in 2009. The Company experienced a reduction in its depreciation and amortization margin to 3.2% in 2010 versus 3.5% in 2009, as a result the amortization of
intangible assets of several older acquisitions being fully amortized. The Company had net income of $90.0 million compared to $84.0 million in 2009, a 7.2% increase. Net profit margin
improved to 7.9% in 2010 from 7.8% in 2009.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $1.137 billion, an increase of $62.9 million or 5.9% from 2009 revenues of
$1.074 billion. Commercial pest control represented approximately 42.0% of the Company's business in 2010 and grew 6.9% in 2010 due to increases in sales and improved retention. Residential
pest control represented approximately 39.0% of the Company's business and increased 5.5% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing. The Company's termite business, which represented



approximately
19.0% of the Company's revenue, grew 3.5% in 2010 due to increases in ancillary services sales as well as the Company's expanded sales force.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% and 7% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company established new franchises in
Jamaica, Ireland and Turkey for a total of sixteen international franchises at December 31, 2010. Orkin had 72 and 65 total domestic and international franchises at December 31, 2010 and
2009, respectively.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 cost of services provided increased $32.1 million or 5.8%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2009. Gross margins for the year remained flat at 48.7% for 2010 and 2009. Overall reductions in insurance and risk related costs as well as service salaries were offset by
increase cost of fuel as well as higher personnel related costs, primarily health costs and employment taxes.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, depreciation and amortization decreased $0.8 million, or 2.0% compared to the twelve
months ended December 31, 2009. The decrease is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired related to several older acquisitions by Orkin becoming fully amortized, partially offset by
additional intangible asset amortization associated with the acquisition of Waltham Services and other smaller acquisitions.

Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, sales, general and administrative expenses increased $17.7 million, or 5.0% compared to
the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 representing 32.8% of revenues compared to 33.1% of revenues in the prior year. The increase in total dollars primarily reflects higher personnel
related cost due to higher health insurance expense, employment taxes, sales cost and consulting work while advertising and promotion costs declined. Overall costs rose at a lesser rate than revenue,
reducing the costs as a percent of revenue.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2010 was a $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to
$1.0 million in 2009 due to average debt outstanding over the full year being less than the prior year and an increase in cash on hand.

(Gain)/loss on Sales/Impairment of assets before interest

(Gain)/loss on Sales/Impairment of assets before interest improved to $0.1 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared
to $2.9 million loss in 2009 due to an impairment of assets charge of $2.9 million attributed to a write down of the Company's routing and scheduling initiative in 2009.

Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate was 37.3% in 2010 compared to 33.5% in 2009. The reduced rate in 2009 was due to a tax benefit from converting
several of Rollins, Inc.'s wholly-owned subsidiaries from C corporations to limited liability companies partially offset by taxes on repatriation of Canadian cash to the United States from
Orkin, Inc.'s wholly-owned subsidiary PCO Services.



Results of Operations—2009 Versus 2008

Overview

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company had net income of $84.0 million compared to $68.9 million in 2008, a 21.8%
increase. The Company achieved a 5.2% increase in revenue, with all business lines contributing to the growth. Again our ability to grow during very challenging economic conditions confirms our belief
that the Company is recession resistant. Additionally, the Company was effective in controlling cost as gross margin improved 1.1 percentage points to 48.7% for 2009 versus 47.6% for 2008. Sales,
general and administrative expense also showed a small improvement, 2009 was 33.1% of revenue versus 33.2% in 2008. While there was a small deterioration in depreciation margin 3.5% in 2009 versus
3.3% in 2008, it is a result of our investments in acquisitions, most notably HomeTeam and Crane.

During
2009 we were able to direct our business so that the weak economy did not have a serious impact. The Company's business model provides for strength from recurring revenues and a diverse
customer base; in 2009, our largest twenty customers were less than 3.5% of our total revenues. The 2009 revenue growth was due to an expanded sales force, an emphasis on customer retention and
acquisitions. This coupled with strong cost management and tax strategies led to the 21.8% increase in net income in 2009.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $1.1 billion, an increase of $53.4 million or 5.2% from 2008 revenues of
$1.0 billion. Commercial pest control represented 41.0% of the Company's business in 2009. Commercial pest control revenues grew 5.4% in
2009 due primarily to an expanded sales force, the Company's emphasis on customer retention, the addition of Crane Pest Control and strong domestic growth at PCO Services, Orkin's Canadian business.
Residential pest control represented approximately 39.0% of the Company's business. Residential pest control revenues increased 5.0% in 2009 due to the acquisition of HomeTeam Pest Defense, the
expanded sales force and the Company's pricing initiative. The Company's termite business, which represented approximately 19.0% of the Company's revenue, grew 6.0% in 2009 due to the acquisition of
HomeTeam Pest Defense as well as the Company's expanded sales force.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% and 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company established a new franchise in
Cyprus and in Lebanon in 2009 for a total of thirteen international franchises at December 31, 2009. Orkin had 65 and 63 total domestic and international franchises at December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 cost of services provided increased $16.5 million or 3.1%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2008. Gross margins year to date increased to 48.7% for 2009 versus 47.6% for 2008. Margins improved 93 basis points due to lower cost of fuel and a 36 basis point
improvement in productivity. These improvements were partially offset by increases in material and supply costs driven by change in sales mix, as commercial, fumigation and termite control have higher
material and supply costs than residential pest control.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, depreciation and amortization increased $3.7 million, an increase of 11.1% compared to
the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to $3.7 million in depreciation and amortization related to the acquisition of HomeTeam on April 3, 2008 and the
Crane Pest Control acquisition of December 31, 2008.



Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, sales, general and administrative expenses increased $16.5 million, or 4.9% compared to
the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 representing 33.1% of revenues compared to 33.2% of revenues in the prior year period. The increase in total dollars and expense margin primarily
reflects having a full year of HomeTeam's expenses in 2009 and only nine months in 2008 along with a full year of Crane that was acquired December 31, 2008. Savings in lower fuel costs were
offset by increase in sales costs as we expanded our sales team.

Interest (Income)/Expense, Net

Interest (income)/expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was a $1.0 million expense, an increase of $0.2 million compared
to interest expense of $0.8 million in 2008 due to average debt outstanding over the full year being greater than the prior year and a reduction of cash on hand.

(Gain)/loss on Sales/Impairment of assets before interest

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 there was an impairment of assets charge of $2.9 million loss due to a fourth quarter
write down of the Company's routing and scheduling initiative.

Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate was 33.5% in 2009 compared to 39.0% in 2008. The reduced rate in 2009 is due to a tax benefit from converting
several of Rollins, Inc's wholly-owned subsidiaries from C corporations to limited liability companies partially offset by tax on repatriation of Canadian cash from Orkin's wholly-owned subsidiary PCO
Services to the United States.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Flow

The Company's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $20.9 million, $9.5 million and
$13.7 million, respectively.

The
Company's operations generated cash of $124.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily from net income of $90.0 million, compared with cash provided by operating
activities of $110.8 million in 2009 and $90.7 million in 2008. The Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from
operating activities and available borrowings under its $175.0 million credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business
for the foreseeable future

The
Company made contributions totaling $5.2 million to the Rollins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries defined benefit retirement plans (the "Plans") during the year ended
December 31, 2010 and $5.0 million during each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 as a result of the Plans' funding status. The Company is considering making
contributions to its Plans of approximately $6.0 million during



fiscal
2011. In the opinion of management, additional Plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The
Company used $47.6 million on investments for the year ended December 31, 2010 and invested approximately $13.0 million in capital expenditures during the year. Capital
expenditures for the year consisted primarily of equipment replacements and technology related projects. The Company expects to invest between $13.0 million and $20.0 million in 2011 in
capital expenditures. During 2010, the Company acquired Waltham Services and several smaller companies totaling $34.8 million compared to $11.0 million in acquisitions during 2009 and
$152.4 million in 2008. The expenditures for the Company's acquisitions were primarily funded by cash on hand and borrowings under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company
continues to seek new acquisitions.

The
Company used cash of $65.5 million on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010. A total of $35.5 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.24 per share, post
3-for-2 stock split) during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $27.9 million ($0.1867 per share, post 3-for-2 stock split)
during the year ended December 31, 2009 and $25.0 million ($0.1667 per share, post 3-for-2 stock split) in 2008. The Company used $29.7 million to repurchase 1.9 million
shares of its common stock, adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock split, on the open market at a weighted average price of $13.95 per share during 2010 compared to
$29.1 million to purchase 2.5 million shares, adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock split, at an average price of $11.02 in 2009 and $23.2 million to purchase
2.1 million shares at a weighted average price of $10.62 in 2008. There are 2.5 million shares authorized remaining to be repurchased under prior Board approval.

On
March 28, 2008, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which
includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $10.0 million swingline subfacility. As of December 31, 2010, borrowings of $25.0 million were outstanding
under the line of credit and $1.0 million under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately $29.3 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by
the Company's fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company's self-insured status, to secure various workers' compensation and casualty insurance contracts
coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

The
Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Rollins' domestic subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is March 27, 2013. Outstanding balances of individual tranches under
the Credit Agreement currently mature in the first quarter of 2011. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company's
election:

•

the Base Rate, which is the highest of SunTrust Bank's "prime rate" for the day of the borrowing, a fluctuating rate per
annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one month; or

•

with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, Adjusted LIBOR (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum
reserve percentages established by the U.S. Federal Reserve) plus an additional amount, which varies between .50% and .75%, based upon Rollins' then-current
debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2010, the additional rate allocated was .50%.

The
Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the Company's ability to incur
certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants
restricting the Company's ability to permit the ratio of the Company's consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The
Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2010 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2011.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results
of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Subsequent Events

—The Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. As of, the filing date, February 25,
2011, there were no subsequent events that would affect its financial statements.

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor
and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and government regulation. It is
significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company's business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant
claims. Positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts, more effective treatment methods, more effective termiticides, and expanding training.

Accrued Insurance

—The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and vehicle
liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported
(although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent
third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration, along with management's



knowledge
of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these factors. Due to the uncertainty associated with the
estimation of future loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data, actual developments may vary from the Company's projections. This is particularly true since critical assumptions
regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment. Therefore, changes in estimates may be material. Management's judgment is inherently subjective and a number
of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. The Company continues to be proactive in risk
management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. Initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on
all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing. The Company has improved the time required to report a
claim by utilizing a "Red Alert" program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go
back to work on a limited-duty basis.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain revenue types,
because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are
primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general,
pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for
those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the
discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues. Termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new
baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and
installation of the monitoring services. The amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service. Fair values are generally established based on the
prices charged when sold separately by the Company. The amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining
contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual
contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Revenue
received for termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and
associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical
information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and, while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are
incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue
are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for
any expected losses.

Contingency Accruals

costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the
litigation,



judgments
concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of
management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Defined benefit pension plans

—In 2002, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit plan, although the Company
remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through March 2002. The Company has other smaller pension plans acquired related to acquisitions included in note 12 to the Company's
financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined benefit plan in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715

"Compensation- Retirement Benefits"

, and
engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the
estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.

The
Company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment
adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses)
ultimately affects future pension expense. The Company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets is seven percent which is unchanged from the prior year.

The
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes a yield curve approach.
The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company's expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at
the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result
in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. The discount rate was 5.51 percent as of December 31, 2010 compared to 6.01 percent in 2009 and
6.81 percent in 2008. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.

As
set forth in note 12 to the Company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan's investments are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments
comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not
have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with ASU No. 2009-12 "

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its
Equivalent),"

these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to
judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating
the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.

As
of December 31, 2010, the defined benefit plans were under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders' equity by $1.2 million
before tax.

New Accounting Standards

Recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2011

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2009-13,
Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, or "ASU 2009-13." ASU 2009-13 establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements that include multiple
revenue-generating activities, and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables, and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The
amendments in ASU



2009-13
also establish a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor's multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms of the arrangement, significant deliverables, and the vendor's performance within arrangements. The amendments also require
providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue
recognition. The amendments in ASU 2009-13 are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15,
2010, or January 1, 2011 for us. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In
January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," which amends the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value
measurements. The guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the
timing of the transfers and information on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under Level 3 of the fair
value measurement hierarchy. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures which are
effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company adopted the amendments for levels 1 and 2 in the first quarter of 2010 and the adoption did not
have a material impact on the disclosures of (in) the Company's consolidated financial statements. The adoption of the amendment for level 3 will not have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.

Other
new pronouncements issued but not effective until after January 1, 2011 are not expected to have a significant effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Recently Adopted Accounting standards

In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued certain amendments as codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic
820-10, "Fair Value Disclosures." ASC 820-10 affirms that the objective of fair value when the market for an asset is not active is the price that would be received to sell the
asset in an orderly transaction, and includes additional factors for determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset when the market for that asset is not
active. An entity is required to base its conclusion about whether a transaction was not orderly on the weight of the evidence. The Company adopted the provisions in the second quarter of 2009 and the
adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2009, the FASB issued certain amendments as codified in ASC 805-20 "Identifiable Assets and Liabilities, and Any Noncontrolling Interest" which clarifies ASC 805 "Business
Combinations," to address application issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in
business combinations. The amendments require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value if fair value can be
reasonably estimated. If fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, the asset or liabilities would generally be recognized in accordance with ASC 450
"

Contingencies

," if the criteria for disclosures under that topic are met. The disclosures are required for assets or liabilities arising from
contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted these amendments in the first quarter of 2009 the adoption did not have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

There
were various other accounting standards and interpretations issued through February 25, 2011, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position,
operations or cash flows.



Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements include statements regarding the Company's belief that its levels of supplies will alleviate the potential short-term shortage in availability from its
suppliers; management's belief that environmental remediation costs estimated to be incurred are not material to the Company's financial condition or operating results; the outcome of litigation, as
discussed in the Legal Proceedings section and elsewhere, and the Company's belief that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity; the Company's belief that it is recession resistant; the Company's expectation to continue its payment of cash dividends; the adequacy of the Company's resources and
borrowings to fund operations and obligations; management's belief that any additional pension plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operation or liquidity; the Company's projected 2011 capital expenditures; the Company's expectation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in its Revolving Credit Agreement throughout
2010; the impact of the Company's contractual obligations; the impact of recent accounting pronouncements; and interest rate risks and foreign exchange currency risk on the Company's financial
position, results of operations and liquidity. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks, timing and
uncertainties including, without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling against the Company in pending litigation; general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or
technologies; the degree of success of the Company's termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods; the Company's ability to identify potential acquisitions; climate and
weather trends; competitive factors and pricing practices; potential increases in labor costs; and changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. All of the
foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to
differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market Risk

The Company maintains an investment portfolio subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company is also subject to interest
rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175 million credit facility. Currently, interest rates are fixed on the outstanding borrowings of $26.0 million ($25.0 million at
January 31, 2011) creating minimal interest rate risk exposure. However, the Company does maintain approximately $29.3 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is also exposed to market
risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material effect upon the Company's results of operations or financial
position going forward.



MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To
the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The
management of Rollins, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Rollins, Inc. maintains a system of
internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded
against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel. This system
includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2010 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management's assessment is that Rollins, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2010.

The
independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, and has also
issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, included in this report on page 35.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Board
of Directors and Shareholders

Rollins, Inc.

We
have audited Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries' (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—

Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 and
our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE

Board
of Directors and Shareholders

Rollins, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2010 and
2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits of the basic
consolidated financial statements included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries

1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business Description

—Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the
state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and
commercial customers in North America with domestic franchises and international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe.

Orkin, LLC
("Orkin"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is one of the world's largest pest and termite control companies. It provides customized services from over 400
locations. Orkin serves customers in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe providing essential pest control services and
protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin
operates under the Orkin®, and PCO Services, Inc. ® trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin® brand name makes Orkin the most
recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States.

PCO
Services ("PCO"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. PCO Services is Canada's largest pest control provider and a leader in the development of fast,
effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western
Pest Services ("Western"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service
company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers focusing on the northeastern United States.

The
Industrial Fumigant Company ("IFC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and
sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam
Pest Defense ("HomeTeam"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its
unique Taexx in the wall system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders nationally.

The
Company has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company's total revenues.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, includes the United States, Canada, Central
America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe. The Company's results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers
or the Company's foreign operations.



Principles of Consolidation

—The Company's policy is to consolidate all subsidiaries, investees or other entities where it has voting
control, is subject to a significant risk of loss, or is entitled to receive significant residual returns. The Company does not have any interest in other investees, joint ventures, or other entities
that require consolidation.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries owned by the Company. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Subsequent Events

—The Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. As of the filing
date, February 25, 2011, there were no subsequent events that would affect its financial statements.

Estimates Used in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenues

—The Company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain
revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control
services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In
general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount
for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the
discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues. Termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new
baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and
installation of the monitoring services. The amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service. Fair values are generally established based on the
prices charged when sold separately by the Company. The amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining
contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual
contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Revenue
received for termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and
associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and, while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial
number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and
chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made
for any expected losses. The Company accrues for noticed claims. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and
historical information.

All
revenues are reported net of sales taxes.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8%, 7% and 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Interest
income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. Recognition of initial franchise fee revenues occurs when all material services
or conditions relating to a new agreement have been substantially performed or satisfied by the Company. Initial franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial Position
until such time. Royalties from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis. Gains on sales of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at
the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability of accounts
receivable. Management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Substantially all of the
Company's receivables are due from pest control and termite services in the United States and selected international locations. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of
factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. Our established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk
customers. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the
Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in
the period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. There were no large recoveries in 2010, 2009 and 2008. We record specific
provisions when we become aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or
financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are charged to sales, general and administrative expense during the year in which they are incurred.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value. At times, cash and cash equivalents may exceed federally insured
amounts.

Marketable Securities

—From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial
institutions. The Company's investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than "investment grade" by national rating services.

Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. Debt securities are
classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are
stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income.



The
Company had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined pension benefit plan and the nonqualified deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2010 and 2009. See
note 12 for further details.

Materials and Supplies

—Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or
market.

Income Taxes

—The Company provides for income taxes based on FASB ASC topic 740 "Income Taxes", which requires recognition of deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The Company provides an allowance for
deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is
more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully
supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold. The Company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax
expense.

Equipment and Property

—Equipment and Property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which includes the amortization of assets
recorded under capital leases and are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are computed
using the following asset lives: buildings, ten to forty years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, two to ten years. Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are
capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are
eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. The annual provisions for depreciation, below, have been reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization:

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

—In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350,

"Intangibles—Goodwill and
other"

, the Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets
with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. The Company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic downturn or
a change in the assessment of future operations. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the Company level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the
appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with its carrying value. The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each indefinite-lived
intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its most recent annual
impairment analyses as of September 30, 2010. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or other intangible assets was indicated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

—In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360,

"Property, Plant and
Equipment"

, the Company's long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an
asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge
is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset



exceeds
the fair value of the asset. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a
management plan for disposition.

At
December 31, 2009, the Company determined that a significant portion of its routing and scheduling initiative had no useful value and recognized an impairment of the asset of
$2.9 million.

Insurance

—The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation
and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or
unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an
independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration,
along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these factors. Management's judgment is
inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events.

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and
government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company's business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely
predict future significant claims.

Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance
with FASB ASC Topic 450

"Contingencies,"

the Company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and
accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and
costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts
estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Earnings Per Share

—FASB ASC Topic 260-10

"Earnings Per Share-Overall,"

requires
a basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share presentation. Further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or
dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.
During 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of FSP EITF 03-6-1 codified as FASB ASC Topic 260-10-45

"Participating
Securities and the Two-Class Method"

and the adoption had no significant impact to its financial statements.

The
Company has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. See Note 12
for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.

The
basic and diluted calculations differ as a result of the dilutive effect of stock options included in diluted earnings per share, but excluded from basic earnings per share. Basic and diluted
earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods. All share and per share data appearing in the consolidated
financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted for the three-for-two stock split on December 10, 2010.



A reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common stock (participating securities) is as

Translation of Foreign Currencies

—Assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the
year-end rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other
comprehensive income. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign currency are included in the
earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 713
"

Compensation–Stock Compensation

." Stock options and time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management
employees under the Company's Employee Stock Incentive Plan. The Company's stock options generally vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the
terms of the issue. Outstanding TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees
receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise
transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed. These awards are amortized, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years.

The
Company did not grant any stock options during 2010, 2009 or 2008.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

—Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) results from foreign currency translations and minimum pension liability adjustments.

Franchising Program

—Rollins' wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, had 56 domestic franchises as of December 31, 2010. Transactions with domestic franchises
involve sales of customer contracts to establish new franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash
and notes due over periods ranging up to five years. Notes receivable from franchises were $3.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. These amounts are included as trade receivables in
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The
Company recognizes gains from the sale of customer contracts at the time they are sold to franchises and collection on the notes is reasonably assured. The Company recognized net gains of
$1.1 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008, respectively and a net loss of $0.1 million for the sale of customer contracts for the year
ended December 31, 2009 due to customer adjustments. These amounts are included as revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

All
domestic franchises have a guaranteed repurchase clause that the franchise may be repurchased by Orkin at a later date once it has been established; therefore, initial domestic franchise fees are
deferred in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 952-605

"Franchisor Revenue Recognition

," for the duration of the initial contract period and are
included as unearned revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Deferred franchise fees were $2.5 million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

Royalties
from franchises are accrued and recognized in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 952-605

"Franchisor Revenue Recognition

," as revenues
as earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from franchises were $3.4 million, $3.0 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2010, Orkin had 16 international franchises. Orkin's international franchise program began with its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central
America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe.



The Company's maximum exposure to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to the franchises has not exceeded $2.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2008 through 2010.

Three-for-Two Stock Split

—The Board of Directors, at its quarterly meeting on October 26, 2010, authorized a
three-for-two stock split by the issuance on December 10, 2010 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at November 10, 2010.
Accordingly, the par value for additional shares issued was adjusted to common stock, and fractional shares resulting from the stock split were settled in cash. All share and per share data appearing
in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted for these stock splits.

New Accounting Standards

Recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2011

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2009-13,
Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, or "ASU 2009-13." ASU 2009-13 establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements that include multiple
revenue-generating activities, and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables, and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The
amendments in ASU 2009-13 also establish a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor's
multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms of the arrangement, significant deliverables, and the vendor's performance within arrangements. The
amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing
or amount of revenue recognition. The amendments in ASU 2009-13 are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or
after June 15, 2010, or January 1, 2011 for us. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 will not have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

In
January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," which amends the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value
measurements. The guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the
timing of the transfers and information on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under Level 3 of the fair
value measurement hierarchy. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures which are
effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company adopted the amendments for levels 1 and 2 in the first quarter of 2010 and the adoption did not
have a material impact on the disclosures of (in) the Company's consolidated financial statements. The adoption of the amendment for level 3 will not have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.

Other
new pronouncements issued but not effective until after January 1, 2011 are not expected to have a significant effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Recently Adopted Accounting standards

In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued certain amendments as codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)
Topic 820-10, "Fair Value Disclosures." ASC 820-10 affirms that the objective of fair value when the market for an asset is not active is the price that would be
received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction, and includes additional factors for determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset when the market for
that asset is not active. An entity is required to base its conclusion about whether a transaction was not orderly on the weight of the



evidence.
The Company adopted the provisions in the second quarter of 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2009, the FASB issued certain amendments as codified in ASC 805-20 "Identifiable Assets and Liabilities, and Any Noncontrolling Interest" which clarifies ASC 805
"Business Combinations," to address application issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from
contingencies in business combinations. The amendments require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value if fair
value can be reasonably estimated. If fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, the asset or liabilities would generally be recognized in accordance with ASC 450
"

Contingencies

," if the criteria for disclosures under that topic are met. The disclosures are required for assets or liabilities arising from
contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company
adopted these amendments in the first quarter of 2009 the adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

There
were various other accounting standards and interpretations issued during through February 25, 2011, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
position, operations or cash flows.

2.     ACQUISITIONS

Acquisition of HomeTeam Pest Defense:

In April 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Centex Home Services, LLC, a Nevada limited
liability company, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and HomeTeam Pest Defense, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, related to the business of providing termite
and pest control services to homebuilders, businesses and homeowners. The final purchase price paid for the acquisition was $134.0 million. The purchase price was negotiated at arms length.

At
the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam Pest Defense, with its unique Taexx in the wall system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the
industry. HomeTeam Pest Defense services home builders nationally.

HomeTeam
Pest Defense recorded revenues of approximately $134.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. The Company's consolidated statements of income include the results of
operations of HomeTeam Pest Defense for the period beginning April 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010.

The
2008 pro forma financial information presented below gives effect to the HomeTeam Pest Defense acquisition as if it had occurred as of the beginning of our fiscal year 2008. The information
presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of results that would have been



achieved
if the acquisition actually had occurred as of the beginning of such year or results which may be achieved in the future.

Acquisition of Waltham Services:

The Company acquired Waltham Services, Inc on July 31, 2010. Waltham Services, Inc. was established in 1893 in Waltham, Massachusetts.
Waltham Services, with annual revenues exceeding $17 million, is a leading provider of advanced pest management serving New England and New York. Waltham's primary service is commercial and
residential pest control. Prior to the acquisition Waltham was ranked as the 33rd largest company in the industry. Waltham will operate independently to preserve its successful brand, loyal
customers and employees.

Including
the Waltham Services acquisition, the Company has made several acquisitions that are not material either individually or in total to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

3.     DEBT

On March 28, 2008, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to
$175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $10.0 million swingline subfacility. As of December 31, 2010, borrowings of
$25.0 million were outstanding under the line of credit and $1.0 million under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately $29.3 million in letters of credit.
The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims. As of December 31, 2009, borrowings of $30.0 million were
outstanding under the line of credit and there were no borrowings under the swingline subfacility and maintained approximately $34.9 million in letters of credit.

The
Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Rollins' domestic subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is March 27, 2013. Outstanding balances of individual tranches under
the Credit Agreement currently mature in the first quarter of 2011. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company's
election:

•

the Base Rate, which is the highest of SunTrust Bank's "prime rate" for the day of the borrowing, a fluctuating rate per
annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one month; or

•

with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, Adjusted LIBOR (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum
reserve percentages established by the U.S. Federal Reserve) plus an



additional
amount, which varies between .50% and .75%, based upon Rollins' then-current debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2010, the additional rate
allocated was .50%.

As
of December 31, 2010, the effective interest rate on the outstanding borrowing under the line of credit was less than 0.78%. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary terms and
conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the Company's ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or
sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants restricting the Company's ability to permit the ratio of the Company's
consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The
Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2010 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2011.

4.     TRADE RECEIVABLES

The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency aging totals, based on contractual terms,
for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company policies that are specific to pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

6.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable and other
short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values. The Company has financial instruments related to its defined pension plan and
deferred compensation plan detailed in note 12.

The
Company has a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0 million on an unsecured basis at the bank's prime rate
of interest or the indexed London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which includes a $75.0 million letter
of credit subfacility, and a $10.0 million swingline subfacility. As of December 31, 2010, borrowings of $25.0 million were outstanding under the line of credit and
$1.0 million under the swingline subfacility. The fair value of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2010 were approximately $25.7 million based upon interest rates available to
the Company as evidenced by debt of other companies with similar credit characteristics.

The
following table presents our nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2010. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the
reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair
values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.

The
marketable securities classified as available-for-sale and the securities held in the deferred compensation plan are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices,
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

At
December 31, 2010 the Deferred Compensation Plan had 41 life insurance policies with a net face value of $33.3 million. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies had a
net realizable value of $9.4 million and $7.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The total deferred compensation plan assets recorded on the Company's books at
December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $10.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively.



7.     GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill was $210.8 million as of
December 31, 2010 and $189.7 million as of December 31, 2009. Goodwill increased $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $2.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2009 due primarily to acquisitions. The carrying amount of goodwill in foreign countries was $9.4 million as of December 31, 2010 and $9.0 million
as of December 31, 2009. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 30, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

8.     CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Customer contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio that current
revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350

"Intangibles—Goodwill and other",

the expected
lives of customer contracts were reviewed, and it was determined that customer contracts
should be amortized over a life of 8-20 years dependent upon customer type. The carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:

The
Provision for Income Taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.3% on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010. The effective rate differs from the annual federal
statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes.

For
2009 the effective tax rate was 33.5%. The reduced effective tax rate for 2009 was primarily due to benefits received from conversion of several of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries from
C-corporations to limited liability companies resulting in the complete release of the valuation allowance,



offset
slightly by tax associated with repatriation of cash from Orkin's Canadian wholly-owned subsidiary, PCO Services.

For
2008 the effective tax rate was 39.0%. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes.

During
2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company paid income taxes of $60.1 million, $46.4 million and $41.6 million, respectively, net of refunds.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes.

As
of December 31, 2010, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately $198.0 million, which will be available to offset
future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2011 and 2027. During 2009, the Company converted certain operating companies to Limited Liability Companies.
Management believes that, after conversion, it is likely to be able to utilize all state net operating losses before they expire and has determined that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary.
Management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $3.0 million of foreign net operating losses before they expire and has included a valuation



allowance
for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance increased by $0.8 million due to the foreign net operating losses

Earnings
from continuing operations before income tax includes foreign income of $7.8 million in 2010, $8.5 million in 2009 and $5.7 million in 2008. During December
2009, the international subsidiaries remitted their earnings to the Company in the form of a one time dividend. In the future the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely the undistributed earnings of
some of its non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $2.6 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The
Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. In many cases these uncertain tax positions are related to
tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. The tax returns for 2002 and 2003 are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service. During 2009 several
issues included in the examination were settled for $1.1 million, including interest. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various state jurisdictions that are currently under audit for
years ranging from 1996 through 2008. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years prior
to 2005.

It
is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease in the next 12 months. These changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing state audits. It
is expected that certain state audits will be completed in the next 12 months resulting in a reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 million. None of the
reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits discussed above will affect the effective tax rate.

The
Company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $0.6 million and $0.8 million as of
December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. During 2010 the Company recognized interest and penalties of $0.9 million.

10.   ACCRUAL FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450

"Contingencies,"

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing
the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals,
settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

11.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases buildings, vehicles and equipment under operating and capital leases, some of which contain escalation clauses. The capital leases contractually expire at
various dates through 2011. The assets and liabilities acquired under capital leases are recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of future lease payments, and are
depreciated over the actual contract term. Depreciation of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense for 2010 and 2009. Following is a summary of property held

In
the normal course of business, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the
rendering of services by the defendant subsidiary. The subsidiaries are actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits have been filed (

John Maciel
v. Orkin, Inc., et al.; Douglas F. Bracho, Jr. v. Orkin, Inc.; Khan V. Orkin, Inc., et.al.; John Urbino v. Orkin Services of
California, Inc. and Rollins, Inc.

; and

Jennifer Thompson and Janet Flood
v. Philadelphia Management Company, Parkway Associated, Parkway House Apartments, Barbara Williams, and Western Pest Services

) in which the plaintiffs are
seeking certification of a class. These cases originate in California and Pennsylvania, respectively. The

Maciel

lawsuit, a
wage and hour related matter, was filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California and a new date for a class certification hearing has not been scheduled. The

Bracho

lawsuit, a
matter related to payroll deductions for use of Company vehicles, was filed in the Superior Court of
Orange County, California, and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Khan

suit, a termite service
related matter, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Urbino

lawsuit, a wage and
hour related matter, was filed in the Superior Court of Orange County, California. It has not
been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The

Flood

lawsuit, a bed bug service related matter filed by residents of
an apartment complex, was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, and has not been scheduled for a class certification hearing. The Company believes these matters are
without merit and intends to vigorously contest certification and defend itself through trial or arbitration, if necessary. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or
litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

Orkin, LLC
is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company's liability under any of these matters

Employee
Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Rollins, Inc.
Retirement Income Plan

The
Company maintains several noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan (the "Plans") covering employees meeting certain age and service requirements. The Plans provides
benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five years during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated Social
Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plans with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company made contributions of $5.2 million to the Plans during the year ended
December 31, 2010 with $5.0 million in contributions made for 2009 and 2008.

In
June 2005, the Company froze the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit pension plan. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for its defined benefit
post-retirement plans. The funded



status
of the Plans and the net amount recognized in the statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of:

Included
in Plans are newly acquired pension plans from acquisitions of companies during the year ended December 31, 2010. The accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension
plans were $184.0 million and $159.5 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the
same for the Plans. Increases in the pension liability which were (charged, net of tax) credited to other comprehensive income/(loss) were $(1.9) million, $(23) thousand and
$(44.2) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The
return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in the plan. The expected
long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.

The
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, for fiscal year's 2010, 2009 and 2008
the Company utilized a yield curve analysis.

The
Company does not expect to amortize a net gain or loss in 2011. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Plan's assets were comprised of listed common stocks and U.S. government and corporate
securities, real estate and other. Included in the assets of the Plan were shares of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock with a market value of $30.3 million and $19.7 million at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



The

For
each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical—maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk
in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans utilize a number of
investment approaches, including individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. The
Company and management are considering making contribution to the pension plans of approximately $6.0 million during fiscal 2011.

Included
among the asset categories for the Plans' investments are real estate and other investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These investments are categorized as
level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with ASU No. 2009-12
"

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),"

these investments are valued based on the net asset
value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of
incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data
included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company's overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 70 percent of investments for long-term growth and
30 percent for near-term benefit payments, with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies
and fund managers. Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and mid-cap companies. Fixed-income securities include corporate bonds of companies in
diversified securities, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Other types of investments include hedge funds and private equity funds that follow several different investment strategies.

Some
of our assets, primarily our private equity, real estate and hedge funds, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the
underlying investments. For the December 31, 2010 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were
derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.



The
following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2010. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to
determine fair value. See Note 6 for a brief description of the three levels under the fair value hierarchy.

Defined Contribution 401(k) Plan

The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) Plan that is available to a majority of the Company's full-time employees the first of
the calendar quarter following completion of three months of service. The Plan is available to non full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one year of service
upon completion of 1,000 hours in that year. The Plan provides for a matching contribution of fifty cents ($.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions to the Plan that do
not exceed 6 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). The charge to expense for the Company match was approximately $7.0 million in
2010, $6.6 million in 2009 and $6.1 million in 2008. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 approximately, 35.1%, 29.3% and 33.1%, respectively of the plan assets consisted of
Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total administrative fees paid by the Company for the Plan were approximately $52 thousand in 2010, $91 thousand in 2009 and $99 thousand in
2008.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan

The Deferred Compensation Plan provides that participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual bonus with respect
to any given plan year, subject to a $2,000 per plan year minimum. The Company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts. The Company currently plans to credit accounts of
participants of long service to the Company with certain discretionary amounts ("Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions") in lieu of benefits that previously accrued under the Company's
Retirement Income Plan up to a maximum of $245,000. The Company intends to make Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan for five years. The first
contribution was made in January 2007 for those participants who were employed for all of the 2006 plan year. Only employees with five full years of vested service on June 30, 2005 qualify for
Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, salary and bonus deferrals and Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions are fully vested. Any discretionary
contributions are subject to vesting in accordance with the matching contribution vesting schedule set forth



in
the Rollins 401(k) Plan in which a participant participates. The Company will be making its last contributions associated with this plan during the first quarter of 2011.

Accounts
will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain "Measurement Funds." Account values are calculated as if the funds
from deferrals and Company credits had been converted into shares or other ownership units of selected Measurement Funds by purchasing (or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current
purchase price of the relevant Measurement Fund at the time of the participant's selection. Deferred Compensation Plan benefits are unsecured general obligations of the Company to the participants,
and these obligations rank in parity with the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company has established a "rabbi trust," which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to
indirectly fund any obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the extent that the Company's obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan exceed assets available under the trust, the
Company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Generally,
the Deferred Compensation Plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant's death, disability, retirement or other termination of
employment (a "Termination Event"). However, for any deferrals of salary and bonus (but not Company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a
Termination Event. Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan in installments or lump-sum
payments.

At
December 31, 2010 the Deferred Compensation Plan had 41 life insurance policies with a net face value of $33.3 million. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies were
worth $9.4 million and $7.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The
estimated life insurance premium payments over the next five years are as follows:

compensation liability as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The amounts of assets were marked to fair value.

Stock Compensation Plans

All share and per share data has been adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective December 10, 2010.

Stock
options and time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company's Employee Stock Incentive Plan. The Company's stock options
generally vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the
terms of the issue. The Company issued TLRSs that vest over ten years prior to 2004. TLRSs issued 2004 and later vest



in
20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting
rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the
plans have lapsed.

For
the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company issued approximately 0.5 million shares (post-split) of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees with
0.3 million shares (post-split) in 2009. In addition, the Company issued time lapse restricted shares of 0.9 million, 0.7 million and 1.0 million (all
post-split) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The
Company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2010, approximately 5.8 million shares of the Company's common stock were reserved for
issuance. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, "

Compensation—Stock Compensation."

The Company uses the modified prospective application
method of adoption, which requires the Company to record compensation cost, related to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of
these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December 31, 2005 are valued at fair value and recognized on
a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.

In
order to estimate the fair value of stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options,
which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time.
