PART I

Item 1. Business

General

Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is a national service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services to both residential and commercial customers in North America.
Services are performed through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, Inc.
("Orkin"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is one of the world's largest pest and termite control companies. It provides customized services from over 400
locations to approximately 1.7 million customers. Orkin serves customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica providing essential pest control services and protection
against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the
Orkin®, Western Pest Services, and PCO Services, Inc.® trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin® brand name makes Orkin the most
recognized pest and termite company throughout the country. The PCO Services brand name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada. The Company is the largest pest control provider in
Canada.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, which includes the United States, Canada,
Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica are included in Item 8 of this document, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" on pages 36 and 37. The Company's results of operations and its financial condition
are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company's foreign operations.

Acquisitions

On October 1, 2005, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the Industrial Fumigant Company ("IFC") for
$23.5 million in cash. The Company's consolidated statements of income include the results of operations of IFC for all periods after October 1, 2005.

On
April 30, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Western Pest Services ("Western"), and the Company's consolidated financial statements
include the operating results of Western from the date of the acquisition. Western was engaged in the business of providing pest control services and the Company has continued this business. The
acquisition was made pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Western Agreement") dated March 8, 2004, between Rollins, Inc. and Western Industries, Inc. and affiliates. The
consideration for the assets and certain non-competition agreements was approximately $110.2 million, including approximately $8.4 million of assumed liabilities.

Prior
to the acquisition, Western was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the eighth largest company in the industry. Western was primarily a commercial pest control service
company and its businesses complemented most of the services that Orkin offers, in an area of the country in which Orkin had not been particularly strong, the Northeast. The Company's consolidated
statements of income include the results of operations of Western for all periods after April 30, 2004.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

In April 2005, The Company announced that as a result of having only 276,216 shares left under the Company's stock buyback program, the Company's Board of Directors
authorized the purchase of an additional 4.0 million shares of our common stock. Total share repurchases for 2006 totaled 1,006,680. In


total
2,258,644 additional shares may be purchased under previously approved programs by the Board of Directors. The program does not have an expiration date.

Backlog

The dollar amount of service contracts as of the end of the Company's 2006, 2005, and 2004 calendar years was $82.6 million, $83.2 million and
$81.2 million, respectively. Backlog services and orders are usually provided within the month following the month of receipt, except in the area of prepaid pest control and bait monitoring
services, which are usually provided within twelve months of receipt. The Company does not have a material portion of its business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of
contracts at the election of a governmental entity.

Orkin Franchise

The Company continues to expand its growth through the Orkin franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently not economically
feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. There is a contractual buyback provision at the Company's option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of
the franchise. There were 58 Company franchises at the end of 2006 compared to 57 at the end of 2005 and 49 at the end of 2004.

The
Company began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994, and established its first international franchise in Mexico in 2000, its second international franchise in Panama in 2003 and its
third international franchise in Costa Rica in 2006.

Seasonality

The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company's pest and termite control services. The increase in pest pressure and activity, as well as the
metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the
Company's pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart. In addition, revenues were favorably impacted in 2004 after the acquisition of Western Pest
Services on April 30, 2004.

Inventories

The Company has relationships with multiple vendors for pest and termite control treatment products and maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies
to fulfill its immediate servicing needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers.

In
early August 2004, the Company signed an agreement with Univar USA under which Univar provides warehouse, logistical and delivery services for Orkin's branches throughout the United States.
This arrangement enables the Company to concentrate on its core pest and termite control business. It has expedited the delivery of products to all branches, and has resulted in improved service
support while lowering branch inventories and freight costs.


As
part of the agreement with Univar, Univar also acquired certain assets of Dettelbach Pesticide Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Orkin. Dettelbach, a southeastern pest control materials
distributor, offered insecticides, termiticides, and equipment to pest control professionals and previously contributed approximately $3.0 million in annual revenue to the Company.

Competition

The Company believes that Rollins, through Orkin, Western Pest Services, and Industrial Fumigant Company, competes favorably with competitors as one of the world's largest pest
and termite control companies. The Company's competitors include Terminix and Ecolab.

The
principal methods of competition in the Company's pest and termite control business are quality of service and guarantees, including the money-back guarantee on pest and termite
control, and the termite re-treatment and damage repair guarantee to qualified homeowners.

Research and Development

Expenditures by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and improved service methods and
products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies. Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.

The
Company maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.

The
Company also conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products. The Company also works closely with industry consultants and suppliers to improve service and
establish new and innovative methods and procedures.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

The Company's pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment, public health and consumer
protection. Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act ("FIFRA")

This federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control companies operate. Each
state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the following: licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of
products. This allows each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens' wishes in each state. The pest control industry is
impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 ("FQPA")

The FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts its business.

Environmental Remediation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as Superfund, is the primary Federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive
hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of
hazardous substances, and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved


will
work with the EPA and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Consistent with the Company's responsibilities under these
regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these
situations arise, the Company accrues management's best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management's current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs
are material to the Company's financial condition or operating results.

Employees

The number of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2007 was approximately 8,400 compared to approximately 8,400 at December 31, 2006 and
approximately 8,000 at December 31, 2005. This increase in the number of employees in 2006 was due in part to the addition of several salespeople and several small acquisitions.

Available Information

Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these
reports, are available free of charge on our web site at www.rollins.com as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Item 1.A.    Risk Factors

We may not be able to compete in the competitive and technical pest control industry in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by the following factors: changes in competitive prices, weather related issues, general
economic issues and governmental regulation. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers. We believe that
the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are product and service quality and availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price.
Although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent, we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.

We may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions have been and will continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable
acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business.
Any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

Our operations are directly affected by the weather conditions across the United States and Canada. The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the
Company's pest and termite control services. The increase in pest pressure and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the
timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company's pest and termite control operations during such periods.


Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand our operations is in part
impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees is high, and the supply is very limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could
result in a reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and profitability could be diminished, and our
growth potential could be impaired.

Our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.

In the normal course of business, Orkin, one of the Company's subsidiaries, is a defendant in a number of lawsuits, which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result
of the rendering of services by Orkin. Orkin is actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits or arbitrations have been filed (

Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren et
al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc., et al.

; and

Francis D. Petsch, et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al.

) in which
the plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class. The cases originate in Georgia and Florida. This includes

Mark and Christine Butland et al. v. Orkin Exterminating
Company, Inc. et al.

pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa, Florida. In Butland, the Court issued a ruling certifying this as a class action, but Orkin
appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals, which in June 2006 denied certification of the class. Following the Plaintiffs' motion for rehearing, the court upheld its
prior decision that class certification was improper but also ruled that the Plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower class. Orkin will vigorously oppose any effort
by the Plaintiffs to do so. In

Warren

, the Superior Court of Cobb County, Marietta, Georgia, ruled in August 2006, certifying the class action against Orkin. Orkin
has appealed this ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The Company believes these matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest certification and defend itself through trial or
arbitration, if necessary. In the opinion of management,
the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of
enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings,
or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted. We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations. We also believe
that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental
laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective
actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.

The Company's Management Has a Substantial Ownership Interest; Public Stockholders May Have No Effective Voice In the Company's Management

The Company has elected the "Controlled Company" exemption under rule 303A of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Company Guide. The Company is a "Controlled Company"
because a group that includes the Company's Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins, his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, also a
director of the Company, certain companies under their control, and the nephew of R. Randall Rollins and son of Gary W. Rollins, Glen W. Rollins, who is the Vice President of Rollins, Inc.,
controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company's voting power. As a "Controlled Company," the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.


Rollins, Inc.'s
executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 58 percent of the Company's
outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate
transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from
acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Item 1.B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None

Item 2.    Properties.

The
Company's administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The Company owns or leases over 400 branch offices and
operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins Training Center located in Atlanta, Georgia, the Orkin Customer Care Center located in Covington, GA, and the Pacific Division
Administration and Training Center in Riverside, CA. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important physical property of the Company. The facilities are
suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.

Orkin,
one of the Company's subsidiaries, is a named defendant in

Mark and Christine Butland et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al.

pending in the
Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa, Florida. The plaintiffs filed suit in March of 1999 and are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. The Court ruled in early April 2002,
certifying the class action lawsuit against Orkin. Orkin appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals, which remanded the case back to the trial court for further findings. In
December 2004 the Court issued a new ruling certifying the class action. Orkin appealed this new ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals. In June 2006, the Florida Second
District Court of Appeals issued a ruling denying certification of the class. Following the Plaintiffs' motion for rehearing, the court upheld its prior decision that class certification was improper
but also ruled that the Plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower class. Orkin will vigorously oppose any effort by the Plaintiffs to do so. Orkin believes this case
to be without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously through trial, if necessary. At this time, the final outcome of the litigation cannot be determined. However, in the opinion of management,
the ultimate resolution of this action will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Additionally,
in the normal course of business, Orkin is a defendant in a number of lawsuits, which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services by Orkin. Orkin is
actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits or arbitrations have been filed (

Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc.,
et al.

; and

Francis D. Petsch, et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al.

) in which the Plaintiffs are seeking certification of a
class. The cases originate in Georgia and Florida. In

Warren

, the Superior Court of Cobb County, Marietta, Georgia, ruled in August 2006, certifying the class
action against Orkin. Orkin has appealed this ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The Company believes these matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest certification and defend
itself through trial or arbitration, if necessary. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Orkin
is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company's liability under any of these matters would not and
did not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.


Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There
were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders, through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the fourth quarter of 2006.

General Operating Comments

The Company's addition of the Industrial Fumigant Company in October 2005, along with continued emphasis on customer retention and building recurring revenues was the
primary driver of revenue growth of 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The
non-GAAP financial measure in the table above is provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparability of the Company's operations for 2006 and 2005. The Company
believes that revenue excluding the Industrial Fumigation Company, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful basis to compare the Company's results, as it shows the Company's growth in
revenue without this significant acquisition (see "adjusted revenues excluding the IFC" in previous table). Management of the Company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides both
management and investors with a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operating results and operating trends. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to analyze
and forecast the Company's operating results and trends, especially when comparing such results to the Company's prior periods and forecasts. Because the excluded item does not exhibit the same growth
pattern or variances as other factors affecting the


Company's
revenues and net income, management believes that the non-GAAP measure is useful for trend analysis. However, the usefulness of the non-GAAP measures is limited
because the measures alone do not give a complete assessment of historical financial position, operating results or cash flows. These are reflected in the U.S. GAAP financial statements, including the
Company's consolidated statement of income. The non-GAAP financial information that the Company provides may also differ from the financial information provided by other companies.
Therefore, the Company only uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the context of a complete disclosure of operating results. Investors should only consider the non-GAAP
measures as part of the overall analysis of the Company's financial results and trends. The previous presentation reconciles reported net revenues (U.S. GAAP amounts) to revenue excluding the
Industrial Fumigant Company for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The non-GAAP information should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under U.S. GAAP.

The
financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were positively impacted by an investment in sales and marketing. The Company expanded its sales force by approximately 100
associates which resulted in the highest percentage of internal sales improvement in the Company's recent history. The Company has also continued to emphasize technician sales which are up 14.0% in
2006.

For
the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had net income of $57.8 million compared to $52.8 million in 2005, which represents a 9.5% increase. In addition to the revenue
increase of 7.0%, the Company's Cost of Services Provided as a percentage of revenues decreased by 1.2 percentage points to 53.3% while Sales, General and Administrative Expenses expressed as a
percentage of revenues increased 0.3 percentage points to 32.7% and our Provision for Income Taxes expressed as a percentage of income before taxes decreased 0.7 percentage points to
39.3%. In 2005 the Company's results were benefited by a pension curtailment gain of $4.2 million ($2.5 million net of tax) that did not reoccur in 2006. Net Income expressed as a
percentage of revenues increased to 6.7%, a 0.1 percentage point increase. Exclusive of the 2005 curtailment gain, net income improved 15%.

The
non-GAAP financial measures in the tables above are provided to assist in the reader's understanding of the comparability of the Company's operations for 2006 and 2005. The Company
believes that adjusted income excluding pension curtailment, and adjusted earnings per share – diluted, excluding pension curtailment, both non-GAAP financial measures,
are a useful basis to compare the Company's results, as it shows the Company's growth in income without unusual items (see "adjusted income, excluding pension curtailment" and "adjusted earnings per
share – diluted, excluding pension curtailment" in previous table). The Company's results for 2005 include a $2.5 million pension curtailment gain, net of taxes, in
connection with freezing the Company's defined benefit pension plan which was recorded in accordance with
GAAP. There is no comparable gain for 2006. Management of the Company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides both management and investors with a more complete understanding of the
Company's underlying operating results and operating trends. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to analyze and forecast the Company's operating results and trends, especially
when comparing such results to the Company's prior periods and forecasts. Because the excluded item does not exhibit the same growth pattern or variances as other factors affecting the Company's
revenues and net income, management believes that the non-GAAP measure is useful for trend analysis. However, the usefulness of the non-GAAP measures is limited because the
measures alone do not give a complete assessment of historical financial position, operating results or cash flows. These are reflected in the U.S. GAAP financial statements, including the Company's
consolidated statement of income. The non-GAAP financial information that the Company provides may also differ from the financial information provided by other companies. Therefore, the
Company only uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the context of a complete disclosure of operating results. Investors should only consider the non-GAAP measures as part of
the overall analysis of the Company's financial results and trends. The presentation above reconciles reported net income and earnings per share – diluted (U.S. GAAP amounts) to
adjusted income excluding pension curtailment and adjusted earnings per share – diluted, excluding pension curtailment, both non-GAAP financial measures for the years
ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The non-GAAP information should not be construed as an alternative to reported results under U.S. GAAP.

For
the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company's depreciation and amortization totaled $26.9 million comprised of $13.0 million of depreciation and $13.9 million of
amortization of intangibles. The amortization represents a significant non-cash charge to the Statement of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2006, total amortization of
intangibles expense was $13.9 million, versus $12.8 million in 2005. Based upon our fully diluted shares outstanding, amortization of intangible assets represented a charge of $0.20
pre-tax for the year ended December 31, 2006, $0.18 pre-tax for the year ended December 31, 2005, and $0.16 pre-tax for the year ended
December 31, 2004. Amortization of intangible assets represented a charge of $0.12 after tax to GAAP earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006, $0.11 after tax to GAAP
earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005, and $0.09 after tax to GAAP earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2004.

For
the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company's cash, short-term investments increased by $20.3 million. The Company had total cash and cash equivalents of
$63.3 million as of December 31, 2006, a 47.1% increase from the year ended December 31, 2005.

The
Company began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994, and established its first international franchise in Mexico in 2000, its second international franchise in Panama in 2003, and its
third international franchise in Costa Rica in 2006. At December 31, 2006, Orkin had 58 franchises in total as compared to 57 as of December 31, 2005.

Results of Operations—2006 Versus 2005

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $858.9 million, an increase of $56.5 million or 7.0% from 2005 revenues of $802.4 million. The
Company's acquisition of the Industrial Fumigant Company in October 2005, increased revenue by $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and by $6.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005. The Company's historical business excluding the


Industrial
Fumigant Company was $833.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $796.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a $36.9 million increase
or 4.6% for the year compared to 2005 (see "Adjusted net revenues excluding IFC" in earlier table).

The
Company's commercial revenue grew 9.0%, due primarily to the acquisition of the Industrial Fumigant Company, expanded sales force, better customer retention in Orkin's U.S. operations, and strong
growth in its Canadian business operations, which is fundamentally a commercial business. Residential pest control revenues rose by 4.9% in 2006, due to an increased number of leads received, better
average selling prices, continued improvements in customer retention, and a successful price increase. Every-other-month service, the Company's primary residential pest control service offering, now
comprises over 63% of our residential pest control customer base at December 31, 2006.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7.4% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 7.1% in 2005.

Cost
of Services Provided for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $20.7 million or 4.7%, while the expense margin expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased, representing
53.3% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 54.5% for the prior year. The dollar increase was mainly due to the addition of the Industrial Fumigant Company, which accounted for
$17.7 million of the total, as well as increases in service salaries, insurance and claims, and fleet expenses due to higher fuel costs. Service technician productivity and average pay
continued to improve, which leads to better employee retention and ultimately improved customer retention. Cost of Services Provided as a percent of revenue decreased primarily due to reduced
insurance and claims and favorable group medical costs.

Sales,
General and Administrative for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $20.8 million or 8.0% while the expense margin increased by 0.3 percentage points, or 32.7% of
total revenues compared to 32.4% for the prior year. The dollar increase for the year was primarily a result of the acquisition the Industrial Fumigant Company, as well as increases in administrative
and sales salaries. Sales, General and Administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased due to the higher salary expense related to approximately 100 plus sales associates the Company added
to its sales force, greater
administrative salaries due to expansion of call centers offset by the lower relative Sales, General and Administrative cost of the Industrial Fumigant Company.

Depreciation
and Amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $26.9 million or 10.6% higher than the prior year. The increase was due to an additional
$1.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense resulting primarily from the acquisition of the Industrial Fumigant Company. The Company had approximately $18.7 million in capital
expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $25.5 million in 2005.

In
June 2005, the Company recorded a $4.2 million non-cash curtailment gain in accordance with SFAS No. 88, "Employer's Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits", ("SFAS No. 88") in connection with freezing our defined benefit pension plan, using actuarial assumptions consistent with those we
used at December 31, 2004. SFAS No. 88 requires curtailment accounting if an event eliminates, for a significant number of employees, the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of
their future services. In the event of a curtailment, an adjustment must be recognized for the unrecognized prior service cost associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered. This
event did not reoccur in 2006.

Interest
income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1.5 million, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to lower average invested
assets over the course of 2006.

The
Company's effective tax rate was 39.3% in 2006 compared to 40.0% in 2005. The effective tax rate was 40.0% for the first and second quarters of 2006, 38.8% for the third quarter and 37.8% for the
fourth quarter of 2006 and in 2005 was as follows: 40.5% for the first three quarters; and 36.7% for the fourth quarter.


Results of Operations—2005 Versus 2004

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $802.4 million, an increase of $51.5 million or 6.9% from 2004 revenues of $750.9 million. The
Company's acquisitions of Western Pest Services, in April 2004, and the Industrial Fumigant Company in October 2005, increased revenue by $35.0 million for the year

The
Company's commercial revenue grew 13.8% in 2005, due primarily to the acquisitions of Western Pest Services and the Industrial Fumigant Company, better customer retention in Orkin's U.S.
operations, and strong growth in its Canadian business operations. Residential pest control revenues rose by 1.2% in 2005, due to an increased number of leads received, better average selling prices,
continued improvements in customer retention, and successful price increase campaigns in Orkin's operations. Every-other-month service, the Company's primary residential pest control service offering,
now comprised almost 61% of our residential pest control customer base at December 31, 2005.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 6.5% in 2004.

Cost
of Services Provided for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $41.8 million or 10.6%, although the expense margin expressed as a percentage of revenues increased slightly,
representing 54.5% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 52.6% for the prior year. The dollar increase was mainly due to the additions of Western Pest Services and the Industrial
Fumigant Company, which accounted for $24.5 million of the total, as well as increases in service salaries, insurance and claims, and fleet expenses due to higher fuel costs. Service technician
productivity and average pay continued to improve in 2005, which leads to better employee retention and, in management's opinion, improved customer retention.

Sales,
General and Administrative for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $0.9 million or 0.3% while improving as a percentage of revenues by 2.1 percentage points, or
32.4% of total revenues compared to 34.5% for the prior year. The dollar increase for the year was primarily a result of the acquisitions of Western Pest Services and the Industrial Fumigant Company,
as well as increases in administrative salaries, legal expenses, fleet costs, travel, advertising and promotions and other expenses.

Depreciation
and Amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $24.3 million or 5.4% higher than the prior year. The increase was due to an additional
$6.9 million of depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of Western Pest Services and the Industrial Fumigant Company, while depreciation decreased in other areas as
assets continues to become fully depreciated and amortized at a faster rate than new capital expenditures. The Company had approximately $25.5 million in capital expenditures during the year
ended December 31, 2005 compared to $14.2 million in 2004.

In
June 2005, the Company recorded a $4.2 million non-cash curtailment gain in accordance with SFAS No. 88, "Employer's Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits", ("SFAS No. 88") in connection with freezing our defined benefit pension plan, using actuarial assumptions consistent with those we
used at December 31, 2004. SFAS No. 88 requires curtailment accounting if an event eliminates, for a significant number of employees, the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of
their future services. In the event of a curtailment, an adjustment must be recognized for the unrecognized prior service cost associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered.

Interest
income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.6 million, an increase of $1.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due to higher invested
assets with a higher return on the Company's investments.

The
Company's effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 41.0% in 2004. The effective tax rate was 40.5% for the first three quarters of 2005 and 36.7% for the fourth quarter of 2005 and in 2004
was as


follows:
40.5% for the first quarter; 42.7% for the second quarter; 40.5% for the third quarter; and 38.7% for the fourth quarter.

The
Company believes its current cash balances, future cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under its $70.0 million line of credit will be sufficient to finance its
current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future. The Company's operations generated cash of $85.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $76.8 million in 2005 and $71.5 million in 2004.

The
Company invested approximately $18.7 million in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2006. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of equipment
replacements and upgrades and improvements to the Company's management information systems. The Company expects to invest between $12.0 million and $15.0 million in 2007 in capital
expenditures. During 2006, the Company made several acquisitions totaling $10.1 million compared to $27.2 million during 2005. The acquisitions were funded fully with cash from
operations in 2006. The Company continues to seek new acquisitions and will also give consideration to any attractive acquisition opportunities presented. A total of $17.0 million was paid in
cash dividends ($0.0625 per share a quarter) during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $13.7 million or $0.05 per share a quarter during 2005. The Company repurchased
1,006,680 shares of Common Stock in 2006 and there remain 2,258,644 shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board authorization. The Company maintains $70.0 million of credit facilities
with commercial banks, of which no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2006. The Company maintains approximately $38.8 million in letters of credit, which reduced its
borrowing capacity under the credit facilities. These letters of credit are required by the Company's fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company's self-funded
status, to secure various workers' compensation and casualty insurance contracts. These letters of credit are established by the bank for the Company's fronting insurance companies as collateral,
although the Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

Orkin,
one of the Company's subsidiaries, is aggressively defending a class action lawsuit filed in Hillsborough County, Tampa, Florida. In early April 2002, the Circuit Court of Hillsborough
County certified the class action status of

Butland et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al

. Orkin appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District
Court of Appeals, which remanded the case back to the trial court for further findings. In December 2004 the Court issued a new ruling certifying the class action status. Orkin appealed this
ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals. In June 2006, the Florida Second District Court of Appeals issued a ruling denying certification of the class. Following the Plaintiffs'
motion for rehearing, the court upheld its prior decision that class certification was improper but also ruled that the Plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower
class. Orkin will vigorously oppose any effort by the Plaintiffs to do so. In

Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc., et
al

., pending in the Superior Court of Cobb County, Marietta, Georgia, the Court ruled in August 2006 certifying the class action against Orkin. Orkin has appealed this


ruling
to the Georgia Court of Appeals. Other lawsuits against Orkin, and in some instances the Company, are also being vigorously defended, including the

Petsch

case. For
further discussion, see Note 7 to the accompanying financial statements.

The
Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2002 and 2003. The IRS has issued Notices of Proposed Adjustment with respect to various issues. The Company is
currently reviewing its position regarding the adjustments and plans to defend against those adjustments that are without merit. The Company does not expect the resolution of these issues, taken
individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

The
Company made a contribution of $5.0 million to its defined benefit retirement plan (the "Plan") during 2006 and 2005 as a result of the Plan's funding status. The Company believes that it
will make contributions in the amount of approximately $2.5 million in 2007. In the opinion of management, additional Plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company's
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

Other than the operating leases disclosed in the table below, the Company has no material off balance sheet arrangements.

The
impact that the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that
require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and
government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company's business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely
predict future significant claims. Positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts, more effective treatment methods that include a directed-liquid and baiting
program, more effective termiticides, and expanding training.


Accrued Insurance

—The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers'
compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether
reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company
contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration,
along with management's knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these factors. Due to the uncertainty
associated with the estimation of future loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data, actual developments may vary from the Company's projections. This is particularly true since
critical assumptions regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment. Therefore, changes in estimates may be material. Management's judgment is inherently
subjective and a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. It should be noted that
the number of claims has been decreasing due to the Company's proactive risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs. Initiatives that have been implemented include
pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, utilization of a Global Positioning System that has been fully deployed to Company vehicles,
post-offer physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing. The Company has improved the time required to report a claim by
utilizing a "Red Alert" program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to
work on a limited-duty basis.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For
certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest
control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In
general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount
for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the
discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues. Termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual
units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations,
initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services. The amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service. The
amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a
pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that
approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Prior
to 2004, traditional termite treatments were recognized as revenue at the renewal date and an accrual was established for estimated costs of reapplications and repairs to be incurred. Under the
accounting method adopted in 2004, the revenue received is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications
and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and
historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and, while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these
costs are incurred over the contract term. The accounting principle adopted in 2004 eliminates the need to obtain actuarial estimates of the claim costs to be


incurred
and management's estimates of reapplication costs. Also, management believes the newly adopted this accounting method more closely conforms to the current pattern under which revenues are
earned and expenses are incurred, and conforms to the accounting methodology of Orkin and its subsidiary, Western Pest Services. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to
the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

Due
to this change, in 2004 the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment to reduce net income by $6.2 million (net of income taxes). As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of
reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred and no longer accrued. The Company will continue to accrue for
noticed claims.

Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

the Company estimates and accrues for its liability and
costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. It is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation.
However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Stock-Based Compensation

—In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (or "FAS")
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The
revision is referred to as "FAS 123R – Share-Based Payment" (or "FAS 123R"), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
(or "APB 25") and will require companies to recognize compensation expense, using a fair-value based method, for costs related to share-based payments including stock options and stock
issued under our employee stock plans. We have adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective basis on January 1, 2006. Our adoption of FAS 123R resulted in compensation expense
reduced diluted net income per share by approximately $0.01 per share for 2006. Stock-based compensation expense is affected by our stock price, as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation
assumptions and the related tax effect. These valuation assumptions include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors.

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards

In January 2006, we adopted

SFAS No. 123, "Share-Based Payment (Revised 2004)."

SFAS 123R establishes
standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity (i) exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, or (ii) incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services
that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments. SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for stock-based
compensation using APB 25 and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date, which is generally the date
of the grant. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Details related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and the impact to the Company's financial statements
are more fully discussed in Note 8 – Employee Benefit and Stock Compensation Plans.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88 106, and 132(R)."

SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit
post-retirement plans as an asset or a liability in its statement of financial position. The funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit
obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation for other post-retirement


benefit
plans). An employer is also required to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position with changes in the funded status
recognized through comprehensive income. SFAS 158 also requires certain disclosures regarding the effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed
recognition of gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and the transition asset or obligation. The Company was required to recognize the funded status of the plan in its financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company had previously recognized the funded status of the plan in prior financial statements. See Note 8 – Employee Benefit
and Stock Compensation Plans for additional information related to this plans. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the year-end statement of
financial position is effective for the Company's financial statements beginning with the year ended after December 15, 2008. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement
date for the plans.

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins

In September 2006, the SEC issued

Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements."

SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying
misstatements in the current year financial statements. The effects of prior year uncorrected errors include the potential accumulation of improper amounts that may result in a material misstatement
on the balance sheet or the reversal of prior period errors in the current period that result in a material misstatement of the current period income statement amounts. Adjustments to current or prior
period financial statements would be required in the event that after application of various approaches for assessing materiality of a misstatement in current period financial statements and
consideration of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, a misstatement is determined to be material. SAB 108 is applicable to all financial statements issued by the Company after
November 15, 2006. SAB 108 became affective for the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements."

SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company on
January 1, 2008 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Positions and Interpretations

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of SFAS
No. 109." FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an enterprise's tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on
derecognition, classification, interest, penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure related to uncertain income tax positions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006. Accordingly, the Company will be required to adopt FIN 48 in first quarter 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of FIN 48 will
have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.


Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include
statements regarding the expected impact of potential future pension plan contributions, future contributions of Western, expected contributions of the commercial business segment, the outcome of
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and the outcome of other litigation, as discussed in the Legal Proceedings section and elsewhere, interest rate risk and foreign exchange currency
risk on the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity; the adequacy of the Company's resources and borrowings to fund operations and obligations; management's expectation
regarding the Company's expense for amortization of intangibles during 2007; the Company's projected 2007 capital expenditures; the impact of the Company's contractual obligations; the impact of
recent accounting pronouncements; and the expected outcome of the growth of national account revenue. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the
forward-looking statements because of various risks, timing and uncertainties including, without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling against the Company
in pending litigation; general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or technologies; the degree of success of the Company's termite process reforms and pest control selling
and treatment methods; the Company's ability to identify potential acquisitions; climate and weather trends; competitive factors and pricing practices; potential increases in labor costs; and changes
in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the
Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market Risk

As of December 31, 2006, the Company maintained an investment portfolio subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company is also subject to
interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $70.0 million credit facility. Due to the absence of such borrowings as of December 31, 2006, this risk was not significant in 2006
and is not expected to have a material effect upon the Company's results of operations or financial position going forward. However, the Company does maintain approximately $38.8 million in
Letters of Credit. The Company is also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material effect
upon the Company's results of operations or financial position going forward.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries

1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business Description

—Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") is a national service company with headquarters located in
Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services to both residential and commercial customers.

Orkin, Inc.
("Orkin"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is one of the world's largest pest and termite control companies. It provides customized services from over 400
locations to approximately 1.7 million customers. Orkin serves customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica, providing essential pest control services and protection
against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the
Orkin® and PCO Services, Inc.® trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark.

On
April 30, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Western Pest Services ("Western"), and the Company's consolidated financial statements
include the operating results of Western from the date of the acquisition.

On
October 1, 2005, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the Industrial Fumigant Company ("IFC"), and the Company's consolidated financial
statements include the operating results of IFC from the date of the acquisition.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. The Company's results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few
customers or the Company's foreign operations.

Principles of Consolidation

—The Company's policy is to consolidate all subsidiaries, investees or other entities
where it has voting control, is subject to a majority of the risk of loss or is entitled to receive a majority of residual returns. The Company does not have any subsidiaries or investees where it has
less


than
a 100% equity interest or less than 100% voting control, nor does it have any interest in other investees, joint ventures, or other entities that require consolidation.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries owned by the Company. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Estimates Used in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenues

—The Company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are
performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and
commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a
given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company
offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The
Company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues. Termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the
inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid
termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services. The amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service. The amount deferred for the
undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that
approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the
timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

Prior
to 2004, traditional termite treatments were recognized as revenue at the renewal date and an accrual was established for estimated costs of reapplications and repairs to be incurred. Under the
accounting method adopted in 2004, the revenue received is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon
current factors and historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and, while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the
contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. The accounting principle adopted in 2004 eliminates the need to obtain actuarial estimates of the claim costs to be incurred and
management's estimates of reapplication costs. Also, management believes the newly adopted this accounting method more closely conforms to the current pattern under which revenues are earned and
expenses are incurred, and conforms to the accounting methodology of Orkin and its subsidiary, Western Pest Services. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected
revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

Due
to this change, in 2004 the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment to reduce net income by $6.2 million (net of income taxes). As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of
reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred and no longer accrued. The Company will continue to accrue for
noticed claims.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Revenues are presented net of sales taxes.


Interest
income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. Franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial
Position for the duration of the initial contract period. Royalties from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis. Gains on sales of pest control customer
accounts to franchises are recognized at the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected
collectibility of accounts receivable. Management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectibility of accounts receivable.

Advertising

—Advertising expenses are charged to expense during the year in which they are incurred. The total
advertising costs were approximately $36.0 million, $34.1 million, and $33.4 million 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. Short-term investments,
included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, cash held in foreign bank accounts amounted to approximately
$9.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively.

Marketable Securities

—From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large,
well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company's investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than "investment grade" by national rating services. The
Company's marketable securities generally consist of United States government, corporate and municipal debt securities.

Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. Debt securities are
classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are
stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income.

Materials and Supplies

—Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out basis) or market.

Income Taxes

—The Company provides for income taxes based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The Company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than
not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized.

Equipment and Property

—Depreciation and amortization, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under
capital leases, are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation of $13.0 million in 2006,
$11.5 million in 2005, $12.1 and million in 2004 have been reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization. These annual provisions
for depreciation are computed using the following asset lives: buildings, ten to forty years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, three to ten years. Expenditures for additions, major
renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated
depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

—In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets"

, the Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization;
(2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and


(3) goodwill.
The Company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives or goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. The
Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the company level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with its
carrying value. The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The
Company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its annual impairment analyses as of September 30, 2006. Based upon
the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or other intangible assets was indicated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets)

—In accordance with SFAS 144, "

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"

, the Company's long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with
definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and
used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Based upon the results of
these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its long-lived assets was indicated.

Insurance

—The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability,
workers' compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur,
whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The
Company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major
consideration, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these factors. Management's
judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events.

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs
of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals,
settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the
actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company's business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. Positive changes
to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts, more effective treatment methods that include a directed-liquid and baiting program, more effective termiticides and expanded
training.

Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of
business. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

the Company estimates and accrues
for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. It is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of
the litigation. However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Treasury Shares

—The Company records treasury stock repurchases at par value and records the difference between cost
and par value as a reduction of treasury stock additional paid-in-capital and retained


earnings.
During 2006, 1.0 million shares were repurchased for $19.4 million. During 2005, 1.7 million shares were repurchased for $30.2 million. During 2004,
57 thousand shares were repurchased for $900 thousand.

Earnings Per Share

—In accordance with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per
Share

("EPS"), the Company presents basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed on the basis of weighted-average shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed on the basis
of weighted-average shares outstanding plus common stock options outstanding during the year, which, if exercised, would have a dilutive effect on EPS. Prior basic and diluted EPS for all years has
been restated for the stock split effective March 10, 2005. A reconciliation of the number of weighted-average shares used in computing basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

Translation of Foreign Currencies

—Assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars
are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables,
denominated in foreign currency are included in the earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company adopted FAS 123R as of January 1, 2006. Through
December 31, 2005, the Company has followed APB 25 to account for employee stock options. Under APB 25, the intrinsic value method of accounting, no compensation expense is recognized
because the exercise price of the employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company applied FAS 123 for disclosure purposes only, and
recognized compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.

In
order to estimate the fair value of stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options
which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time.

The
following proforma net income and earnings per share (or "EPS") for 2004 and 2005 were determined as if the Company had accounted for employee stock options and stock issued under its employee
stock


plans
using the fair value method prescribed by FAS 123. The 2006 actuals are presented for comparative purposes only.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

—Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) results from foreign currency translations, minimum
pension liability adjustments, and unrealized loss on marketable securities.

Franchising Program

—Orkin had 58 franchises as of December 31, 2006, including international franchises in
Mexico, established in 2000, Panama, established in 2003, and Costa Rica, established in 2006. Transactions with franchises involve sales of customer contracts to establish new franchises, initial
franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods ranging up to 5 years. Notes receivable
from franchises aggregated $5.2 million, $5.5 million, and $5.2 million as of December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively. The
Company recognizes gains from the sale of customer contracts at the time they are sold to franchises and collection on the notes is reasonably assured. The Company recognized overall gain for the sale
of customer contracts of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $1.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004, and these amounts are included as revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Initial franchise fees are deferred for the duration of the
initial contract period and are included as unearned revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Deferred franchise fees amounted to $2.2 million, $2.0 million, and
$1.6 million at December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively. Royalties from franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a
monthly basis. Revenues from royalties were $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and
$1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company's maximum exposure to loss relating to the franchises aggregated $3.0 million, $3.5 million, and
$3.6 million at December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

—The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable and other short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial
instruments approximate their fair values.

Three-for-Two Stock Split

—The Board of Directors, at its quarterly meeting on
January 25, 2005, authorized a three-for-two stock split by the issuance on March 10, 2005 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of
record at February 10, 2005. Accordingly, the par value for additional shares issued was adjusted to common stock, and fractional shares resulting from the stock split were settled in cash. All
share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted for this split.


Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

—Prior to 2004, traditional termite treatments were recognized as
revenue at the renewal date and an accrual was established for estimated costs of reapplications and repairs to be incurred. Beginning fourth quarter 2004, the Company adopted an accounting method
under which the revenue received is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and
associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred and no longer accrued. For noticed claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors
and historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and, while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts,
these costs are incurred over the contract term. The accounting principle adopted in 2004 eliminates the need to obtain actuarial estimates of the claim costs to be incurred and management's estimates
of reapplication costs. Also, management believes the newly adopted accounting method more closely conforms to the current pattern under which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred, and
conforms the accounting methodology of Orkin and its recently acquired subsidiary, Western Pest Services. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to
be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

Due
to this change, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce net income by $6.2 million (net of income taxes) during 2004.

New Accounting Standards

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards

In January 2006, the Company adopted

SFAS No. 123, "Share-Based Payment (Revised 2004)."

SFAS 123R establishes
standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity (i) exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, or (ii) incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services
that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments. SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for stock-based
compensation using APB 25 and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date, which is generally
the date of the grant. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Details related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and the impact to the Company's financial
statements are more fully discussed in Note 8 – Employee Benefit and Stock Compensation Plans.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88 106, and 132(R)."

SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post-retirement plans
as an asset or a liability in its statement of financial position. The funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit
obligation for pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). An employer is also required to measure the funded status of a plan as of the
date of its year-end statement of financial position with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income. SFAS 158 also requires certain disclosures regarding
the effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and the transition asset or obligation. The
Company was required to recognize the funded status of the plan in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company had previously recognized the funded status of the
plan in prior financial statements. See Note 8 – Employee Benefit and Stock Compensation Plans for additional information related to this plans. The requirement to measure
plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the year-end statement of financial position is effective


for
the Company's financial statements beginning with the year ended after December 15, 2008. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for the plans.

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins

In September 2006, the SEC issued

Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, "Considering the Effects of a Prior Year Misstatements When
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements."

SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying
misstatements in the current year financial statements. The effects of prior year uncorrected errors
include the potential accumulation of improper amounts that may result in a material misstatement on the balance sheet or the reversal of prior period errors in the current period that result in a
material misstatement of the current period income statement amounts. Adjustments to current or prior period financial statements would be required in the event that after application of various
approaches for assessing materiality of a misstatement in current period financial statements and consideration of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, a misstatement is determined to be
material. SAB 108 is applicable to all financial statements issued by the Company after November 15, 2006. SAB 108 became affective for the Company's fiscal year ended
December 31, 2006 and did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued

SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements."

SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company on
January 1, 2008 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Positions and Interpretations

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of SFAS
No. 109." FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an enterprise's tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest, penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure related to uncertain income tax positions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. Accordingly, the Company will be required to adopt FIN 48 in first quarter 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of
FIN 48 will have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

2.     TRADE RECEIVABLES

Trade
receivables, net, at December 31, 2006, totaling $61.5 million and at December 31, 2005, totaling $57.1 million, are net of allowances for doubtful accounts of
$7.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Trade receivables include installment receivable amounts, which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates. These amounts
were approximately $8.8 million and $9.4 million at the end of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Trade receivables also include note receivables due from franchises, which amounted to
$5.2 million and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate
market rates for these types of contracts. The Allowance For Doubtful Accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency aging totals, based on
contractual terms, for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to company policies that are specific to pest


control,
commercial and termite accounts. At any given time, the Company may have immaterial amounts due from related parties, which are invoiced and settled on a regular basis. Receivables due from
related parties were approximately $115,000 as of December 31, 2006, and approximately $82,000 as of December 31, 2005.

4.     GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangibles
consist primarily of goodwill and customer contracts and also include trademarks and non-compete agreements, all related to businesses acquired. Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill and certain indefinite lived trademarks was $133.6 million as of
December 31, 2006 and $133.7 million as of December 31, 2005.

On
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. As of January 1, 2002,
amortization of goodwill and trademarks was terminated, and instead the assets are subject to periodic testing for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment analyses as of
September 30, 2006. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or trademarks has occurred.

Customer
contracts and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio
that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues,
based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance with Statement 142, the expected lives of customer contracts and non-compete agreements were reviewed, and it was determined that
customer contracts should be amortized over a life of 8 to 12


/


years dependent upon customer type. The carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts and
non-competes were as follows:

The
Provision for Income Taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 39.25% on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006. For 2005 the effective tax rate was 40.0% and for
2004 the effective tax rate was 41.0%. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes. During 2006, 2005 and 2004,
the Company paid income taxes of $31.3 million, $30.1 million and $29.0 million, respectively, net of refunds.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes.

As
of December 31, 2006, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $257 million, which will be available to offset future state
taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2008 and 2024. The state net operating losses and the valuation allowance are presented on a gross basis for 2006 and 2005.
Management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $220 million of these net operating losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect
of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance increased by $2.3 million due to additional losses generated in the current year.

The
Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2002 and 2003. The IRS has issued Notices of Proposed Adjustment with respect to various issues. The Company
has reviewed its position regarding the adjustments and plans to defend against those adjustments that are without merit. The Company does not expect the resolution of these issues, taken individually
or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Earnings
from continuing operations before income tax includes foreign income of $2.7 million in 2006, $2.2 million in 2005 and $2.4 million in 2004. The Company intends to
reinvest indefinitely the undistributed earnings of some of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $5.4 million of earnings from
those international subsidiaries that had not been remitted to the United States. Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or alternative means, the


distribution
would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the statutory rate of 35 percent, less foreign tax credits applicable to such distributions.

6.     ACCRUAL FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In
accordance with SFAS No. 5,

"Accounting for Contingencies,"

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated
costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and
chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

7.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The
Company leases vehicles and equipment under operating and capital leases which are accounted for accordingly. The capital leases contractually expire at various dates through 2008. The assets and
liabilities acquired under capital leases are recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of future lease payments, and are depreciated over the actual contract term. Depreciation
of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense for 2006 and 2005.

The
Company maintains credit facilities with two banks that allow it to borrow up to $70.0 million on an unsecured basis at the bank's prime rate of interest or the indexed London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) under which $38.8 million in Letters of Credit were outstanding at December 31, 2006. No borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility as of
December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Orkin,
one of the Company's subsidiaries, is a named defendant in

Mark and Christine Butland et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al.

pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa, Florida. The plaintiffs filed suit in March of 1999 and are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. The Court ruled in early April
2002, certifying the class action lawsuit against Orkin. Orkin appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals, which remanded the case back to the trial court for further
findings. In December 2004 the Court issued a new ruling certifying the class action. Orkin appealed this new ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals. In June 2006, the Florida Second
District Court of Appeals issued a ruling denying certification of the class. Following the Plaintiffs' motion for rehearing, the court upheld its prior decision that class certification was improper
but also ruled that the Plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower class. Orkin will vigorously oppose any effort by the Plaintiffs to do so. Orkin believes this case
to be without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously through trial, if necessary. At this time, the final outcome of the litigation cannot be determined. However, in the opinion of management,
the ultimate resolution of this action will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Additionally,
in the normal course of business, Orkin is a defendant in a number of lawsuits, which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services by Orkin. Orkin is
actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits or arbitrations have been filed

(Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc.,
et al.; and Francis D. Petsch, et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al.)

in which the Plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class. The
cases originate in Georgia and Florida. In Warren, the Superior Court of Cobb County, Marietta, Georgia, ruled in August 2006, certifying the class action against Orkin. Orkin has appealed this ruling
to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The Company believes these matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest certification and defend itself through trial or arbitration, if necessary. In
the opinion of management, the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Orkin
is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company's liability under any of these matters would not
materially affect its financial condition or results of operations. Consistent with the Company's responsibilities under various regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments and
remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these situations arise, the Company accrues management's best estimate of
future costs for these activities.


Based
on management's current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the Company's financial condition or operating results.

8.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

The
Company maintains a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plan (the "Plan") covering employees meeting certain age and service requirements. The Plan provides
benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five years during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated Social
Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plan with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company made contributions of $5.0 million to the plan during the year ended
December 31, 2006, $5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. Effective January 1, 2002,
the Company adopted amendments to the Plan including a change to the benefit calculation and limiting plan participation to current participants. These amendments are reflected in benefit obligations
below.

In
June 2005, the Company recorded a $4.2 million non-cash curtailment gain in accordance with SFAS No. 88, "Employer's Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined
Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits", ("SFAS No. 88") in connection with freezing our defined benefit pension plan, using actuarial assumptions consistent with those used at
December 31, 2004. SFAS No. 88 requires curtailment accounting if an event eliminates, for a significant number of employees, the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their
future services. In the event of a curtailment, an adjustment must be recognized for the unrecognized prior service cost associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered.

The
Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for its defined benefit post-retirement plans. The funded status of the Plan and the net amount recognized in the
statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of December 31:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plan was $153.6 million and $153.0 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (Increases) decreases in
the minimum pension liability which were (charged, net of tax) credited to other comprehensive income (loss) were $9.7 million, ($13.8) million and ($32.1) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

The
return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in the plan. The expected
long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.

The
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes the Moody's Aa
long-term corporate bond yield with a yield adjustment made for the longer duration of the Company's obligations. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations

The
estimated net loss that will be amortized in 2007 is expected to be $3.7 million. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Plan's assets were comprised of listed common stocks and U.S.
government and corporate securities. Included in the assets of the Plan were shares of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock with a market value of $15.1 million and $13.4 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The
Plan's weighted average asset allocation at December 31, 2006 and 2005 by asset category, along with the target allocation for 2007, are as follows:

Our
investment strategy for our pension plan is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing
pension benefits. The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class, which is rebalanced as required. The plan utilizes a number of investment approaches, including individual
market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. The Company expects to contribute approximately
$2.5 million to the pension plan in 2007 and


does
not expect to receive a refund in 2007. The estimated future benefit payments over the next ten years are as follows:

The
Company sponsors a deferred compensation 401(k) plan that is available to substantially all employees with six months of service. The plan provides for a matching contribution (made in the form of
Common Stock of the Company) of fifty cents ($.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) beginning January 1, 2005 and thirty cents ($.30) for each one dollar ($1.00) prior to January 1, 2005 of a
participant's contributions to the plan that do not exceed 6 percent of his or her annual compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). The charge to expense for the Company
match was approximately $4.7 million in 2006, $4.2 million in 2005 and $2.7 million in 2004. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 approximately, 30.1%, 29.8% and 28.4%,
respectively of the plan assets consisted of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total administrative fees for the plan were approximately $159 thousand in 2006, $240 thousand in 2005 and
$248 thousand in 2004.

For
the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company has issued approximately 0.7 million shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the Company issued approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees.

Stock
options and time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company's Employee Stock Incentive Plan. The stock options generally vest
over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the
terms of the issue. The Company issued TLRSs that vest over ten years prior to 2004. TLRSs issued 2004 and later vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant,
over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is
issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

The
Company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2006, approximately 4.1 million shares of the Company's common stock were reserved for
issuance. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"), which requires the
Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted including stock options and TLRSs based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
SFAS 123R supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). The Company has adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires the Company to record compensation cost
related to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change
in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December 31, 2005 are


valued
at fair value in accordance with provisions of SFAS 123R and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company estimated forfeiture rates for 2006
based on its historical experience.

Prior
to 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB 25 using the intrinsic value method, which did not require that compensation cost be recognized for the
Company's stock options provided the option exercise price was established at 100% of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. Under APB 25, the Company was required to record expense
over the vesting period for the fair value of TLRSs granted. Prior to 2006, the Company provided pro forma disclosure, as if the fair value method defined by SFAS No. 123 had been applied to
its stock-based compensation. The Company's net income and net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been reduced if compensation cost related to stock options had
been recorded in the financial statements based on fair value at the grant dates.

In
order to estimate the fair value of stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options
which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time.

The
only options outstanding at December 31, 2006 for SFAS 123R purposes are the grants issued during the first quarters of 2002 and 2003. The Company did not grant any stock options in
any years following the 2003 grant; therefore no Black-Scholes calculation was necessary.

As
a result of adopting SFAS 123R, the impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.9 million (net of
$0.6 million tax benefit) lower, than if the Company had continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25. There was no impact to both basic and diluted earnings per share for the
year ended December 31, 2006. Pro forma net income as if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards as of December 31, 2005 is as follows:

The
following pro forma net income and earnings per share (or "EPS") for 2004 and 2005 were determined as if the Company had accounted for employee stock options and stock issued under its employee
stock plans using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123. The 2006 actuals are presented for comparative purposes only.

10.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

On
April 28, 2004, the Company sold real estate in Okeechobee County, Florida to LOR, Inc., a company controlled by R. Randall Rollins, Chairman of the Board of Rollins, Inc. and
Gary W. Rollins, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer of Rollins, Inc. for $16.6 million in cash. The sale resulted in a net gain after tax of
$8.1 million or $0.11 per share since the real estate had appreciated over approximately 30 years it had been owned by the Company. The Company deferred a portion of the gain pending the
completion of a survey that may result in the return of a portion of the proceeds. The real estate was under a lease agreement with annual rentals of $131,939 that would have expired June 30,
2007. On May 28, 2004, the Company sold real estate in Sussex County, Delaware to LOR, Inc. for $111,000 in cash. The sale resulted in an immaterial net gain after tax. The Board of
Directors, at its quarterly meeting on January 27, 2004, approved the formation of a committee (the "Committee") made up of Messrs. Bill J. Dismuke and James B. Williams, who are
independent directors, to evaluate the transactions. In addition, the Company on October 22, 2004 purchased real estate located at 2158 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324, adjacent to
the Company's headquarters, from LOR, Inc. for $4.6 million. The Committee was furnished with full disclosure of the transactions, including independent appraisals, and determined that
the terms of the transactions were reasonable and fair to the Company. The Company sold an additional piece of real estate in Sussex County, Delaware to LOR, Inc. or an entity wholly owned by
LOR, Inc. The transaction took place on December 29, 2004 and resulted in a $6.3 million, net of costs, gain after taxes.

The
Company provides certain administrative services and rents office space to RPC, Inc. ("RPC") (a company of which Mr. R. Randall Rollins is also Chairman and which is otherwise
affiliated with the Company). The service agreements between RPC and the Company provide for the provision of services on a cost reimbursement basis and are terminable on six months notice. The
services covered by these agreements include office space, administration of certain employee benefit programs, and other administrative services. Charges to RPC (or to corporations which are
subsidiaries of RPC) for such services and rent totaled to $70,000 in 2006, $71,000 in 2005 and $76,000 in 2004.

will be payable March 12, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business February 12, 2007. The Company's new annual dividend rate is $0.30 per share.

13.   ACQUISITIONS

On
October 1, 2005, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the Industrial Fumigant Company ("IFC") for $23.5 million in cash. The
Company's consolidated statements of income include the results of operations of IFC for all periods after October 1, 2005. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded
$11.5 million in goodwill and $7.8 million in identifiable intangibles, primarily customer contracts.

On
April 30, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Western Pest Services ("Western"). The Company's consolidated financial statements
include the operating results of Western from the date of the acquisition. Neither Western nor its principals had any prior relationship with the Company or its affiliates. Western was engaged in the
business of providing pest control and termite services and the Company intends to continue this business. The acquisition was made pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Western Agreement")
dated March 8, 2004, between Rollins, Inc. and Western Industries, Inc. and affiliates. The consideration for the assets and certain non-competition agreements (the
"Purchase Price") was approximately $110.2 million, including approximately $8.4 million of assumed liabilities. The Purchase Price was funded with cash on hand, the sale of property
located in Okeechobee County, Florida and a $15.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

Pursuant
to the Western Agreement, the Company acquired substantially all of Western's property and assets, including accounts receivable, real property leases, seller contracts, governmental
authorizations, data and records, intangible rights and property and insurance benefits. As described in the Western Agreement, the Company assumed only specified liabilities of Western and
obligations under disclosed assigned contracts.

The
Company engaged an independent valuation firm to determine the allocation of the Western purchase price. Such valuation resulted in the allocation of $40.8 million to Goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets and $49.8 million to other intangible assets, principally customer contracts. The finite-lived intangible assets, principally customer contracts, are being
amortized over periods principally ranging from 8 to 12.5 years on a straight-lined basis. The total amount of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition is expected to be tax deductible
over the appropriate periods.

On
April 30, 2004, in a transaction ancillary to the Western acquisition, the Company acquired Residex Corporation ("Residex"), a company that distributes chemicals and other products to pest
management professionals, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Residex Agreement") dated March 8, 2004, between Rollins, Inc. and Western Industries, Inc., JBD
Incorporated and Residex Corporation. Subsequently on April 30, 2004, the Company sold Residex to an industry distribution group. The amounts involved were not material and no gain or loss was
recognized on the transaction.

after adjusting for all stock splits to date. However, the Company's 1998 Employee Stock Incentive Plan under which these options were granted stated that no one person may receive in any one year
over 225,000 in options. (Mr. Rollins' option grant was for 450,000 shares.) Therefore, the excess is deemed not issued under a security holder approved equity compensation plan. Shares issued
upon exercise of these options must be of treasury shares.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Board
of Directors and Stockholders

of Rollins, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rollins, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Our
audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. Schedule II, as listed in the Index on page 69, is presented for
purposes of
additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic consolidated financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic
consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

As
described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, "Employers'
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" and also the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" during 2006 and changed its method of accounting for the revenues and costs associated with conventional termite renewal contracts in
2004.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Rollins, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To
the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The
management of Rollins, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Rollins maintains a system of internal
accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be
relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The internal control system is augmented by written policies
and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel. This system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operations of internal controls over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management's assessment is that Rollins, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006.

The
independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, who has audited the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, included in the 2005 annual
report, have also issued their report on management's assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Board
of Directors and Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.

We
have audited management's assessment included in Management's Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting included in Rollins, Inc's. (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the
"Company") Form 10-K for 2006, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 and our report dated
February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
