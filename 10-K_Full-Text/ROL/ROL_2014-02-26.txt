PART I

Item 1. 	Business

General

Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”)
was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The Company is an international service
company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries
to both residential and commercial customers in North America and Australia with international franchises in Central America, the
Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that
specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, LLC. (“Orkin”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite control company. It provides
customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin serves customers, either directly or indirectly through franchises, in the United
States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico providing essential
pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food
service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the Orkin

®

,
and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes
Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand name provides similar brand
recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada's largest pest control provider and a leader in the
development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western Pest Services (“Western”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial
pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers focusing on the northeastern United
States.

The Industrial Fumigant Company (“IFC”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest
management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam Pest Defense (“HomeTeam”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition,
HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx tubes in the wall pest control system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked
as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders nationally.

Rollins Australia (“Rollins
Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”), in February 2014
subsequent to Rollins 2013 fiscal year end. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest
provides traditional commercial, residential, and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related
to Australia’s biosecurity program and provides specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas
sectors.

The Company has several smaller wholly-owned
subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit
and identifiable assets for this segment, which includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean,
the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico are included in Item 8 of this document, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data” on pages 27 and 28. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not
reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company’s foreign operations.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

At the July 2012 Board of Directors’
meeting, the Board authorized the purchase of 5.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The authorized share repurchases
are in addition to the Company’s existing plan of which 298,183 shares remained available for repurchase as of July 24, 2012.
During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company repurchased on the open market 0.3 million and 0.8 million shares
at a weighted average price of $24.56 and $20.93, respectively. In total, there are 5.0 million additional shares authorized to
be repurchased under prior Board approval. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.


Backlog

Backlog services and orders are usually
provided within the month following the month of order receipt, except in the area of prepaid pest control and bait monitoring
services, which are usually provided within twelve months of order receipt. The Company does not have a material portion of its
business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a governmental entity.

Orkin Franchises

The Company continues to expand its growth
through Orkin’s franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently not economically
feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are subject to a contractual buyback provision at Orkin’s
option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise. International franchise agreements
also contain an optional buyback provision; however, the franchisee has the prior right of renewal of agreement. The Company through
its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994, and established its first international
franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean,
Europe, Africa and Mexico.

Seasonality

The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control
services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence
of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the
Company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The Company has relationships with a national pest control product distributor and other vendors for pest
and termite control treatment products. The Company maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to
fulfill its immediate servicing needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network
of suppliers.

Competition

The Company believes that Rollins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, Orkin Canada, HomeTeam Pest
Defense, Western Pest Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services and TruTech competes favorably
with competitors as the world’s largest pest and termite control company. The Company’s competitors include Terminix,
Ecolab and Rentokil.


The principal methods of competition in the Company’s pest and termite control business are quality
of service and guarantees, including service quality, and product availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety,
technical proficiency and price.

Research and Development

Expenditures by the Company on research
activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and improved service methods
and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies. Also, a portion of these methods
and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.

The Company maintains a close relationship
with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.

The Company conducts tests of new products
with the specific manufacturers of such products.  The Company also works closely with leading scientists, educators, industry
consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

The Company’s pest control business
is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment, public health and consumers.
Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the Company’s financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act (“FIFRA”)

This federal law (as amended) grants
to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control companies operate.
Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the following: licensing, record
keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This allows each state to institute certain
features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens’ wishes in each state. The
pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (“FQPA”)

The FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling,
handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts its business.

Environmental Remediation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, is the primary Federal statute regulating the cleanup
of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. Responsibilities governed
by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous substances, and establishing the
necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will work with the EPA and under the direction
of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Consistent with the Company’s responsibilities
under these regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments and remediation of hazardous substances from time to
time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these situations arise, the Company accrues management’s
best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management’s current estimates of these costs, management does
not believe these costs are material to the Company’s financial condition or operating results.

Employees

The number of persons employed by the
Company as of January 31, 2014 was approximately 10,650.

as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1.A.

Risk Factors

We may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’
prices, and general economic issues. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control
companies, for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve
are service quality, and product availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price.
Although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent, we cannot assure investors
that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.

Economic conditions may adversely affect our business

Pest and termite services represent discretionary
expenditures to most of our residential customers. As consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures, we may suffer a decline
in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers, including
food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies.
For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses
or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.

We may not be able to identify, complete
or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure
investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future.
We cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with
our own business. Any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are affected by adverse
weather conditions.

Our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions across the United States and Canada. The business
of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest
presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined
by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company’s
pest and termite control operations during such periods. The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as
drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods.

Our inability to attract and retain
skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our ability to remain productive and
profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand our operations
is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees is high, and the supply is very
limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force,
increases in wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and profitability could be diminished,
and our growth potential could be impaired.

Our operations could be affected by
pending and ongoing litigation.

In the normal course of business, some
of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that plaintiffs have been
damaged.  The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate,
will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome
of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual
year.


Our operations may be adversely affected
if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our business is significantly affected
by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of
enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how such laws and
regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted.
We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations. We
also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, such environmental
laws are changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations
and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective
actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.

The Company’s Management Has
a Substantial Ownership Interest; Public Stockholders May Have No Effective Voice In the Company’s Management

The Company has elected the “Controlled Company” exemption under Section 303A of the New York
Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) Listed Company Manual. The Company is a “Controlled Company” because a group that
includes the Company’s Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins and his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the Vice Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, and a director of the Company and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty
percent of the Company’s voting power. As a “Controlled Company,” the Company need not comply with certain NYSE
rules.

Rollins, Inc.’s executive officers,
directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 57 percent
of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of
the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval
of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing
a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Item 1.B. 	Unresolved Staff Comments

None

Item 2. 	Properties.

The Company’s administrative headquarters
are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The Company owns or leases over
500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins Training Center located in Atlanta, Georgia,
the Rollins Customer Service Center located in Covington, Georgia, and the Pacific Division Administration and Training Center
in Riverside, California. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important physical property
of the Company. The facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3. 	Legal
Proceedings.

In the normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of
lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services by the defendant
subsidiary.  The subsidiaries are actively contesting these actions.  In addition, the Company defends employment related
cases from time to time.

John Maciel v. Orkin, Inc., et al

. is a wage and hour related matter in which the plaintiffs sought certification of a class.  The

Maciel

lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California,
and has now been settled resulting in a dismissal of the suit with prejudice on January 28, 2014.

Additionally, the Company and a subsidiary, The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC, are named defendants in

Severn Peanut Co. and Meherrin Agriculture & Chemical Co. v. Industrial Fumigant Co., et

al

.

The

Severn

lawsuit, a matter related to a fumigation service, has been filed in the Northern Division of the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  The plaintiffs are seeking damages for breach of contract
and negligence.  The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC was also a named defendant in

Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania
as Subrogee of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Agrinational Insurance Company, Inc. as Subrogee of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company,
and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company v. The Industrial Fumigant Co., The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC, and James Miller

.

This lawsuit has been settled resulting in a dismissal of the suit with prejudice on January 24, 2014. Management does not
believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome
of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual
quarter or year.

Orkin, LLC is involved in certain environmental matters primarily
arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company’s liability under any of these matters
would not and did not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.


Item 4. 	Mine Safety Disclosures.

Not applicable.

General Operating Comments

The year 2013 marked the Company’s 16th consecutive year of reporting improved results of revenue and
profit. In 2013 the Company’s revenue grew 5.2%, with growth in all lines of service. The Company’s revenue from bed
bug service offering grew over 20% for the year and HomeTeam’s TAEXX homebuilder installations rose almost 36%. We have also
expanded Orkin’s international franchise portfolio to a total of 26 international franchises in 9 regions. Further in February
2014 we expanded our international footprint by acquiring Allpest WA located in Perth, Australia.

Management is pleased with the 2013 accomplishments and recognizes many opportunities to improve our business
in the future. We feel we have a premium brand in Orkin

®

that is recognized around the world, as well as other brands
that are well known in their respective markets. We will continue to look for better ways to do what we do in providing our customers
with premiere service that addresses their pest control needs.

Results of Operations—2013
Versus 2012

Overview

The Company’s gross margin increased
to 49.3% for 2013 from 49.0% in 2012. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased in 2013 to 32.0% of revenue versus 32.1%
in 2012. The Company remained flat in its depreciation and amortization margin in 2013 at 3.0% in 2013 and 2012. The Company had
net income of $123.3 million in 2013 compared to $111.3 million in 2012, a 10.8% increase. Net profit margin improved to 9.2% in
2013 from 8.8% in 2012.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $1.337 billion, an increase of $66.4 million or 5.2% from
2012 revenues of $1.271 billion. Commercial pest control represented approximately 41% of the Company’s business in 2013
and grew 4.9% in 2013 due to increases in sales and bed bug revenues. Residential pest control represented approximately 41% of
the Company’s business and increased 6.1% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing as well as increased capture of
TAEXX homebuilder installations and bed bug revenues. The Company’s termite business, which represented approximately 17%
of the Company’s revenue, grew 4.5% in 2013 due to increases in ancillary service sales as well as the Company’s expanded
sales force and price improvement.


The Company implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2013 which had a positive impact on
the year’s revenue. Less than 2.0% of the Company’s revenue increase came from pricing actions. Nearly 80% of the Company’s
revenue was recurring in 2013 and 2012.

The Company’s foreign operations
accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. The Company established new franchises
in Guam, Iraq, Trinidad and Tobago and St. Lucia in 2013 for a total of 26 international franchises at December 31, 2013 with 22
at December 31, 2012. Orkin had 80 and 79 total domestic and international franchises at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 cost of services provided increased $30.9 million or 4.8%, compared
to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. Gross margin for the year was 49.3% for 2013 and 49.0% for 2012. While most costs
increased during the year due to the Company’s early 2013 and late 2012 acquisitions, service salaries, personnel related
costs and materials and supplies increased due to increased sales, increased TAEXX installations and higher group medical insurance
premiums. These costs were partially offset by lower insurance and claims costs.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013,
depreciation and amortization increased $0.9 million, or 2.4% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. The increase
is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in late 2012 and early 2013 partially offset by several fixed and intangible
assets being fully depreciated or amortized.

Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased
$20.8 million, or 5.1% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 representing 32.0% of revenues compared to 32.1% of
revenues in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased due to reduced salaries as a percentage of revenues
as the Company continues to maximize efficiency in its workforce and bad debt expense as the Company continues its focus on collections.
The reductions as a percentage of SG&A are partially offset by increases in professional services due to timing of various
information technology projects and higher advertising expenses due to the Company’s new ad campaigns.

Interest (Income)/Expense, Net

Interest (income)/expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.4 million income, an increase of
$0.4 million compared to $14 thousand expense in 2012. Interest income for the year is due to interest received on cash balances
in the Company’s various cash accounts.

(Gain)/loss on Sales/Impairment of
assets, Net

(Gain)/loss on sales/impairment of
assets, net decreased to $0.2 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $0.5 million gain in 2012. The
Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and property in 2013 and 2012.

Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate was 35.6% in 2013 compared to 37.0% in 2012, due primarily to differences
in state tax rates and foreign income taxes and the release of certain deferred tax liabilities.

Results of Operations—2012
Versus 2011

Overview

The Company’s gross margin increased
slightly to 49.0% for 2012 from 48.8% in 2011. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased in 2012 to 32.1% of revenue
versus 32.3% in 2011. The Company experienced a reduction in its depreciation and amortization margin to 3.0% in 2012 versus 3.1%
in 2011 due to several assets being fully depreciated, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2011.
The Company had net income of $111.3 million compared to $100.7 million in 2011, a 10.5% increase. Net profit margin improved to
8.8% in 2012 from 8.4% in 2011.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December
31, 2012 were $1.3 billion, an increase of $65.8 million or 5.5% from 2011 revenues of $1.2 billion. Commercial pest control represented
approximately 41.0% of the Company’s business in 2012 and grew 3.7% in 2012 due to increases in sales, bed bug revenues and
revenues from 2011 acquisitions. Residential pest control represented approximately 41.0% of the Company’s business and increased
8.0% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing. The Company’s termite business, which represented approximately 18.0%
of the Company’s revenue, grew 4.0% in 2012 due to increases in ancillary services sales as well as the Company’s expanded
sales force and price increases.


The Company’s foreign operations
accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Company established new franchises
in Mexico, China, Turks and Caicos Islands and Chile for a total of 22 and 18 international franchises at December 31, 2012 and
2011, respectively. Orkin had 79 and 76 total domestic and international franchises at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December
31, 2012 cost of services provided increased $30.8 million or 5.0%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. Gross
margin for the year was 49.0% for 2012 and 48.8% for 2011. While all costs increased during the year due to the Company’s
early 2012 and late 2011 acquisitions, insurance and claims expense increased but was partially offset by lower termite provision
claims and telephone costs were down marginally due to cost controls, partially offset by higher personnel related costs including
payroll taxes and group premiums.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012,
depreciation and amortization increased $1.2 million, or 3.1% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. The increase
is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in late 2011 and early 2012 partially offset by several intangible assets
being fully amortized.

Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December
31, 2012, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $18.8 million, or 4.8% compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2011 representing 32.1% of revenues compared to 32.3% of revenues in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues,
SG&A decreased due to reductions in professional services due to timing of projects and reduced salaries as a percentage of
revenues as the Company continues to maximize efficiency in its workforce.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net for the year ended
December 31, 2012 was $14 thousand, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to $0.5 million in 2011 due to the pay-off of the remainder
of the Company’s outstanding borrowings in 2011.

Pension Settlement

Management terminated its wholly-owned
subsidiary’s (Waltham Services, LLC) salaried pension plan and recorded a settlement loss, which resulted in an additional
expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

(Gain)/loss on Sales/Impairment of
assets, Net

(Gain)/Loss on Sales/Impairment of assets,
net increased to $0.5 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $0.4 million loss in 2011. The Company recognized
gains from the sale of owned vehicles and property in Canada in 2012 while recognizing impairment on software related to terminated
projects for approximately $0.5 million in 2011.

Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate
was 37.0% in 2012 compared to 37.5% in 2011, due primarily to differences in state tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Flow

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents
at December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $118.2 million, $65.1 million and $46.3 million, respectively.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

The Company’s operations generated
cash of $162.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily from net income of $123.3 million, compared with cash provided
by operating activities of $141.9 million in 2012 and $154.6 million in 2011. The Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents
balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities and available borrowings under its $175.0 million
credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the
foreseeable future.

The Company made contributions totaling
$5.0 million to the Rollins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ defined benefit retirement plans (the “Plans”)
during the year ended December 31, 2013 and $5.2 million and $4.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively,
as a result of the Plans’ funding status. The Company is considering making contributions to its Plans of approximately $3.3
million during fiscal 2014. In the opinion of management, additional Plan contributions will not have a material effect on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

The Company used $30.8 million on investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $42.7 million and $29.2 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively,
and of that, invested approximately $18.6 million in capital expenditures during 2013 compared to $19.0 million and $18.7 million
during 2012 and 2011, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements
and technology related projects. The Company expects to invest between $15.0 million and $20.0 million in 2014 in capital expenditures.
During 2013, the Company’s subsidiaries acquired several small companies totaling $12.6 million compared to $25.0 million
in acquisitions during 2012 and $11.4 million in 2011. The expenditures for the Company’s acquisitions were funded with cash
on hand. The Company continues to seek new acquisitions.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities

The Company used cash of $75.7 million on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared
to $81.0 million and $99.4 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively. A total of $65.7 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.45
per share) during the year ended December 31, 2013 including a special dividend paid in December 2013 of $0.09 per share, compared
to $64.3 million ($0.44 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2012 including a special dividend paid in December 2012 of
$0.12 per share and $41.1 million ($0.28 per share) in 2011.

The Company used $8.4 million to repurchase on the open market 0.3 million shares of its common stock at a
weighted average price of $24.56 per share during 2013 compared to $16.4 million to purchase 0.8 million shares at an average price
of $20.93 in 2012 and $27.2 million to purchase 1.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $18.68 in 2011. There remains
5.0 million shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. In addition to the shares purchased on the open market,
the Company repurchased $5.3 million, $3.5 million and $3.0 million of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012
and 2011, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.

The Company’s $118.2 million of total cash at December 31, 2013, is primarily cash held at various banking
institutions. Approximately $51.0 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $67.2 million
is primarily held in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various
domestic banks.

The Company’s international business
is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits
and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries
is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The Company maintains a large cash position
in the United States while having little third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources,
without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of
its domestic business for the foreseeable future.


On October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of
America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility,
and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. As of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or
under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately $30.1 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit
are required by the Company’s fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured
status, to secure various workers’ compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has
adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

The Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity
date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2017, subject to optional annual extensions on the next two anniversaries of the Credit
Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates,
at the Company’s election:

·

the Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative Agent publicly
announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the U.S. Federal
Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month,

plus

1.0% per annum.

·

with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus an additional amount, which varies
between .75% and 1.00%, based upon Rollins’ then-current debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2013, the additional rate
allocated was .75%.

The Revolving Credit Agreement contains
customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the
Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its
assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants restricting the Company’s
ability to permit the ratio of the Company’s consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The Company remained in compliance with
applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2013 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2014.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company views critical accounting
policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and
that require management’s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult
or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe
our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The
Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor
and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include
termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent
years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant
claims. Accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.

Accrued Insurance

—The
Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’ compensation
and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon
historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made
until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent
third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information.
The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in
business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a
number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate
indication of future events. The Company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs
to reduce claims. Initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required
on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing. The Company has
improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a “Red Alert” program that provides serious accident assessment
twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work
on a limited-duty basis.

Revenue Recognition

—The
Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain
revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting
estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly
or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general,
pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest
control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers
recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the discounts
related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite baiting revenues are recognized
based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control
review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid
termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered
monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results
in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase
price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional
items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract
period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

At inception revenue received for conventional
termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is
made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance
of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number
of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The
Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to
be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.


All revenues are reported net of sales
taxes.

Contingency Accruals

—The
Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with FASB ASC
Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the
litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately
predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation
are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management,
the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.

Defined benefit pension plans

— In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit plan, although the Company
remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005. The Company terminated the Waltham Services, LLC Salaried
Pension Plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum in December 2012. The Company also includes
the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan to the Company’s financial statements. The Company accounts for these
defined benefit plans in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715

“Compensation- Retirement Benefits”

, and engages
an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant
assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors,
and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.

The Company chooses an expected rate of return
on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views
of our investment adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized
over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense. The Company’s
assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7% which is unchanged from the prior year.

The discount rate reflects the current rate
at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes
a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company’s expected benefit payments over the
life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the
benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments
over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. The discount rate
was 5.20% as of December 31, 2013 compared to 4.17% in 2012 and 5.01% in 2011. A lower discount rate increases the present value
of benefit obligation.

As set forth in note 13 to the Company’s
financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan’s investments are real estate, tactical composite
and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These investments are categorized as level
3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance
with ASU No. 2009-12 “

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),”

these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested.
These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect
valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’
judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

As of December 31, 2013, the defined benefit plans were over-funded and the recorded change within accumulated
other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by $45.7 million before tax and $28.1 million after tax.


New Accounting
Standards

Recently adopted accounting standards

In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU
2012-02). This standard provides new accounting guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it
is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived
intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment, while no further analysis would be required if it passes. The provisions
of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year. Adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact
on the 2013 impairment test results.

Recently issued accounting standards
to be adopted in 2014

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02) to Comprehensive Income. The guidance requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified
out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net
income. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2014; we do not expect the new guidance to
have a material effect on our financial statements.

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and
Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date (a consensus of the
FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date. This
stipulates that (1) it will include the amount the entity agreed to pay for the arrangement between them and the other entities
that are also obligated to the liability and (2) any additional amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of the other entities.
The objective of this update is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from
joint and several liability arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods (and interim reporting
periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
reported results of operations or financial position.

In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent’s Accounting
for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity
or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity. The objective of the amendments in this Update is to resolve the diversity in practice
about whether Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation—Overall, or Subtopic 830-30, Foreign Currency Matters—Translation of Financial
Statements, applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or
all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets
that is a nonprofit activity or a business (other than a sale of in substance real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral
rights) within a foreign entity. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2015; we do not expect
this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit
When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. Topic 740, Income Taxes, does
not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss
carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. There is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized
tax benefits in those instances. Some entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit
is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in, or that resulted in, the recognition of a net operating
loss or tax credit carryforward for that year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized. Other
entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward
in certain circumstances. The objective of the amendments in this Update is to eliminate that diversity in practice. This guidance
is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2014; we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect
on our financial statements.


Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding management’s belief that environmental remediation
costs estimated to be incurred are not material to the Company’s financial condition or operating results; the outcome of
litigation, as discussed in the Legal Proceedings section and elsewhere, and the Company’s belief that such litigation will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; the Company’s
expectation to continue its payment of cash dividends; the adequacy of the Company’s resources and borrowings to fund operations
and obligations; management’s belief that any additional pension plan contributions will not have a material effect on the
Company’s financial position, results of operation or liquidity; the Company’s projected 2014 capital expenditures;
the plans to expand Orkin’s franchise program and to grow in foreign markets through reinvestment of foreign deposits and
future earnings and through acquisitions; the Company’s expectation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in
its Revolving Credit Agreement throughout 2014; the impact and amount of the Company’s contractual obligations; management’s
expectations regarding termite claims and factors that impact future costs from those claims; the expected cost of termite renewals;
the expected collectability of accounts receivable; expected tax consequences; the impact of recent accounting pronouncements;
and interest rate risks and foreign exchange currency risk on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and
liquidity. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because
of various risks, timing and uncertainties including, without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling against the Company
in pending litigation; general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or technologies; the degree of success
of the Company’s termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods; the Company’s ability to identify
potential acquisitions; climate and weather trends; competitive factors and pricing practices; potential increases in labor costs;
and changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties
are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that
could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Item 7A. 	Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market Risk

The Company maintains an investment portfolio subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company
is also subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175 million credit facility. Currently, the Company has
no outstanding borrowings. However, the Company does maintain approximately $30.1 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is
also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate
risk will not have a material effect upon the Company’s results of operations or financial position going forward.


MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The management of Rollins, Inc. is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Rollins, Inc. maintains a
system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded
against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The internal control system is augmented
by written policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel. This system
includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, as of December
31, 2013 based on criteria established in the 1992 Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management’s assessment is that Rollins,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.

The independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP has audited the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, and has also issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting, included in this report on page 25.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Rollins, Inc.

We have audited the internal control
over financial reporting of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2013, based on criteria established in the 1992 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established
in the 1992 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, and our report dated February 26, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Rollins, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial position of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits of the basic consolidated financial statements
included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rollins, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in the 1992 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 26, 2014 expressed
an unqualified opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, Rollins, Inc.
and Subsidiaries

1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business Description

—Rollins,
Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting,
Inc.

The Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest
and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America
with international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico.
Services are performed through a contract that specifies service frequency and the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, LLC. (“Orkin”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite control company. It provides
customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin serves customers, either directly or indirectly through franchises, in the United
States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico providing essential
pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food
service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the Orkin

®

,
and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes
Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand name provides similar brand
recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada's largest pest control provider and a leader in the
development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western Pest Services (“Western”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial
pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers focusing on the northeastern United
States.

The Industrial Fumigant Company (“IFC”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest
management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam Pest Defense (“HomeTeam”),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition,
HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx tubes in the wall pest control system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked
as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders nationally.

The Company has several smaller wholly-owned
subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit
and identifiable assets for this segment, includes the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East,
Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are
not reliant upon any single customer, few customers or foreign operations.

Principles of Consolidation

—
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Rollins, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries and
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The Company does
not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership interest of 50% or less. The Company
is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly,
the Company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. The Company reclassified certain prior period amounts, none of which
were material, to conform to the current period presentation. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Subsequent Events

—The
Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. As of the filing date, February
26, 2014, there were no subsequent events that would affect the Company’s financial statements.

Rollins Australia (“Rollins Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest
WA (“Allpest”), in February 2014 subsequent to Rollins 2013 fiscal year end. Allpest was established in 1959 and is
headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional residential, commercial and termite service as well as consulting
services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity program and provides specialized services to Australia’s
mining and oil and gas sectors.


Estimates Used in the Preparation
of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

—
The Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain
revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting
estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly
or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general,
pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest
control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers
recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the discounts
related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite baiting revenues are recognized
based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control
review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid
termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered
monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results
in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase
price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional
items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract
period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

At inception revenue received for conventional
termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is
made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance
of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number
of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The
Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to
be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

All revenues are reported net of sales
taxes.

The Company’s foreign operations
accounted for approximately 8% of revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Interest income on installment receivables
is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. Recognition of initial franchise fee revenues occurs
when all material services or conditions relating to a new agreement have been substantially performed or satisfied by the Company. 
Initial franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial Position until such time. Royalties from Orkin
franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis. Gains on sales of pest control customer accounts
to franchises are recognized at the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable.  Management
uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectability of accounts
receivable.  Substantially all of the Company’s receivables are due from pest control and termite services in the United
States and selected international locations.  The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination
of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The Company’s established credit evaluation
procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. Provisions for doubtful accounts are
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Accounts are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts
when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected.
Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful
accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. There were no large recoveries in 2013, 2012 and 2011.  We record
specific provisions when we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the
case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position. If circumstances related
to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—
The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to
be cash equivalents. Short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates fair
market value. At times, cash and cash equivalents may exceed federally insured amounts.

The Company’s $118.2 million of
total cash at December 31, 2013, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $51.0 million is held in
cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $67.2 million is primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts
at various domestic banks.

The Company’s international business
is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits
and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries
is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The Company maintains a large cash position
in the United States while having little third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources
without regard to its foreign deposits that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of
its domestic business for the foreseeable future.

Marketable Securities

—
From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company’s
investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than “investment grade” by national rating
services.

Management determines the appropriate
classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. Debt
securities are classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity.
Available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary
on available-for-sale securities are included as a component of interest income.

The Company had no marketable securities
other than those held in the defined pension benefit plan and the nonqualified deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2013
and 2012. See note 13 for further details.

Materials and Supplies

—Materials
and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Income Taxes

-The Company
provides for income taxes based on FASB ASC topic 740

"Income Taxes",

which requires recognition of deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial
statements or tax returns. The Company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when,
despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability
threshold. The Company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Equipment and Property

—Equipment
and Property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital
leases and are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions
for depreciation are computed using the following asset lives: buildings, ten to forty years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating
equipment, two to ten years. Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation
and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged
to income. The annual provisions for depreciation, below, have been reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the
line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
-

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350,

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”

, the Company classifies
intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets
with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. The Company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite
lives and goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more
frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic downturn or
a change in the assessment of future operations. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the Company level. Such impairment
tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with its carrying value. If
the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, then the Company will compare the implied fair value of
goodwill to its carrying value. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying
value.  The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each indefinite-lived
intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds
its estimated fair value. The Company completed its most recent annual impairment analyses as of September 30, 2013. Based upon
the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or other intangible assets was indicated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
-

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360,

“Property, Plant and Equipment”

, the Company’s
long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash
flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the
asset. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including customer
contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Insurance

—The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’ compensation
and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon
historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made
until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent
third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information.
The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in
business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a
number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate
indication of future events.

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs
and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may
impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of
claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely
predict future significant claims. An accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued
liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs
associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible
to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated
with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion
of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition
or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the
Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Earnings Per Share -

FASB ASC
Topic 260-10

“Earnings Per Share- Overall,”

requires a basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share
presentation. Further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or
dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is required to include participating
securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.


The Company has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends
and therefore are considered participating securities. See note 14 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.

The basic and diluted calculations differ as
a result of the dilutive effect of stock options included in diluted earnings per share, but excluded from basic earnings per share.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the respective periods.

A reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to
restricted shares of common stock (participating securities) is as follows (in thousands except per share data):

of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as
those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign currency are included in the earnings of
the current period.

Stock-Based Compensation

—
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 “

Compensation
– Stock Compensation

.” Stock options and time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and
other management employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan. The Company’s stock options generally
vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date.

TLRSs provide for the issuance of a share
of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from
the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. Outstanding TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary
of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting
rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be
sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed. These awards are amortized, net of forfeitures,
on a straight-line basis over six years.

The Company has not granted stock options since 2003.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

—Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss) results from foreign currency translations and minimum pension liability adjustments.

Franchising Program

–
Rollins’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, had 54, 57 and 58 domestic franchises as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Transactions with domestic franchises involve sales of customer contracts to establish new franchises, initial franchise fees and
royalties. The customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods
ranging up to five years. Notes receivable from franchises were $4.1 million at December 31, 2013 and $5.1 million at December
31, 2012. These amounts are included as financing receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The Company recognizes gains from the
sale of customer contracts at the time they are sold to franchises and collection on the notes is reasonably assured. The Company
recognized net gains of $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively
for the sale of customer contracts. These amounts are included as revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

All domestic franchises have a guaranteed
repurchase clause that the franchise may be repurchased by Orkin at a later date once it has been established; therefore, initial
domestic franchise fees are deferred in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,”
for the duration of the initial contract period and are included as unearned revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position. Deferred franchise fees were $2.9 million, $3.0 million and $2.9 million at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Royalties from franchises are accrued and recognized in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor
Revenue Recognition

,” as revenues are earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from franchises was $3.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013 and $3.7 million and 3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

As of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Orkin had 26, 22 and 18
international franchises, respectively. Orkin’s international franchise program began with its first international franchise
in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe,
Africa and Mexico.

The Company’s maximum exposure
to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to the franchises was $1.2 million, $2.1 million
and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.


New Accounting
Standards

Recently adopted accounting standards

In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU
2012-02). This standard provides new accounting guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it
is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived
intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment, while no further analysis would be required if it passes. The provisions
of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year. Adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact
on the 2013 impairment test results.

Recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2014 or later

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02) to Comprehensive Income. The guidance requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified
out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2014; we do not expect the new guidance to have a
material effect on our financial statements.

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and
Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date (a consensus of the
FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date. This
stipulates that (1) it will include the amount the entity agreed to pay for the arrangement between them and the other entities
that are also obligated to the liability and (2) any additional amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of the other entities.
The objective of this update is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from
joint and several liability arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods (and interim reporting
periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
reported results of operations or financial position.

In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent’s Accounting
for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity
or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity. The objective of the amendments in this Update is to resolve the diversity in practice
about whether Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation—Overall, or Subtopic 830-30, Foreign Currency Matters—Translation of Financial
Statements, applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or
all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets
that is a nonprofit activity or a business (other than a sale of in substance real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral
rights) within a foreign entity. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2015; we do not expect
this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit
When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. Topic 740, Income Taxes, does
not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss
carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. There is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized
tax benefits in those instances. Some entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit
is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in, or that resulted in, the recognition of a net operating
loss or tax credit carryforward for that year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized. Other
entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward
in certain circumstances. The objective of the amendments in this Update is to eliminate that diversity in practice. This guidance
is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2014; we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect
on our financial statements.

2.

ACQUISITIONS

The Company has made several acquisitions that are not material
individually or in total to the Company’s consolidated financial statements during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012
and 2011.

Rollins Australia (“Rollins
Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”), in February 2014
subsequent to Rollins 2013 fiscal year end. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest
provides traditional commercial, residential, and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related
to Australia’s biosecurity program and provides specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas
sectors.

3.

DEBT

On October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of
America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility,
and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. As of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or
under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately $30.1 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit
are required by the Company’s fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured
status, to secure various workers’ compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has
adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

The Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity
date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2017, subject to optional annual extensions on the next two anniversaries of the Credit
Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates,
at the Company’s election:

·

the Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative Agent publicly
announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the U.S. Federal
Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month,

plus

1.0% per annum.

·

with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus an additional amount, which varies
between .75% and 1.00%, based upon Rollins’ then-current debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2013, the additional rate
allocated was .75%.

The Revolving Credit Agreement contains
customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the
Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its
assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants restricting the Company’s
ability to permit the ratio of the Company’s consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The Company remained in compliance with
applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2013 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2014.


4.

TRADE RECEIVABLES

The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is
principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency aging totals, based on contractual
terms, for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company policies that are specific to
pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

Rollins manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks.
The Company’s credit risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising Rollins’ customer base and dispersion
across many different geographical regions. The credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based
on an assessment of the individual’s beacon/credit bureau score. Rollins requires potential obligor to have good credit worthiness
with low risk before entering into a contract. Depending upon the individual’s credit score the Company may accept with 100%
financing or require a significant down payment or turndown the contract. Delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. Financing
receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.

$

Total financing receivables, net were
$23.8 million and $23.5 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Financing receivables are charged-off
when deemed uncollectable or when 180 days have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment. The Company’s
charge-off policy has been consistently applied and no significant changes have been made to the policy during the periods reported.
Management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Gross charge-offs
as a percentage of average financing receivables were 2.7% and 2.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and December
31, 2012, respectively. Due to the low percentage of charge-off receivables and the high credit worthiness of the potential obligor,
the entire Rollins, Inc. financing receivables portfolio has a low credit risk.

The Company offers 90 days same-as-cash
financing to some customers based on their credit worthiness. Interest is not recognized until the 91

st

day at which
time it is recognized retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. In certain circumstances,
such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest when they reach 180 days
past due. As of December 31, 2013, there were no accounts on a non-accrual status, and no financing receivables greater than 180
days past due.

Included in financing receivables are
notes receivable from franchise owners. These notes are low risk as the repurchase of these franchises is guaranteed by the Company’s
wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, Inc., and the repurchase price of the franchise is currently estimated and have historically been
well above the receivable due from the franchise owner.

The carrying amount of financing receivables approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market
rates for these types of contracts. Long-term financing receivables, net were $11.6 million and $11.7 million at December 31, 2013
and 2012, respectively.

Rollins establishes an allowance for
doubtful accounts to insure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The allowance balance is comprised
of a general reserve, which is determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance, and a specific reserve, which
is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy or other events, that make
it unlikely that Rollins will recover its investment. The general reserve percentages are based on several factors, which include
consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio
and information derived from competitive benchmarking.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company’s financial instruments consist
of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable, and other short-term liabilities.
The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values. The Company has financial instruments related
to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed in note 13.

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based
on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and
Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.

had a net realizable value of $11.5 million and $11.2 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The total deferred
compensation plan assets, recorded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position, were
$13.7 million and $11.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill was $211.8 million as
of December 31, 2013 and $212.5 million as of December 31, 2012. Goodwill decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily
to currency conversion of Canadian goodwill partially offset by acquisitions. The carrying amount of goodwill in foreign countries
was $9.2 million as of December 31, 2013 $9.8 million as of December 31, 2012. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for

CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Customer contracts are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio that current revenues bear
to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”,

the expected lives of customer contracts were reviewed, and it was determined
that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of 8 to 20 years dependent upon customer type. The carrying amount and
accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:

The Provision for Income Taxes resulted
in an effective tax rate of 35.6% on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effective rate differs
from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes and the release of certain deferred
tax liabilities.

For 2012 and 2011 the effective tax rate was
37.0% and 37.5%, respectively. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because
of state and foreign income taxes.

During 2013, 2012, and 2011, the Company paid income taxes of $69.4 million, $63.0 million and $52.0 million,
respectively, net of refunds.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

As of December 31, 2013, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately $199.0 million, which will be available to offset future
taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2014 and 2028. Management believes that it is unlikely to
be able to utilize approximately $10.0 million of foreign net operating losses before they expire and has included a valuation
allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance increased by $0.2 million
due to the foreign net operating losses.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject
to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. In many cases these uncertain tax
positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. The federal tax audit
for 2002 and 2003 was completed in 2011. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various state and international jurisdictions
that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2006 through 2012. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S.
federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years prior to 2007.

It is reasonably possible that the amount
of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease in the next 12 months. These changes may be the result of settlement of
ongoing audits. None of the reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits discussed above will affect the effective
tax rate.

The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
Accrued interest and penalties were $0.5 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.
During 2013, 2012, and 2011 the Company recognized interest and penalties of $0.9 million, $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.

ACCRUAL FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that
may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

In the normal course of business, certain
of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been
damaged as a result of the rendering of services by the defendant subsidiary.  The subsidiaries are actively contesting these
actions.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases from time to time.

John Maciel v. Orkin, Inc., et
al

. is a wage and hour related matter in which the plaintiffs sought certification of a class.  The

Maciel

lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, and has now been settled resulting in a dismissal of
the suit with prejudice on January 28, 2014.

Additionally, the Company and a subsidiary, The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC, are named defendants in

Severn Peanut Co. and Meherrin Agriculture & Chemical Co. v. Industrial Fumigant Co., et

al

.

The

Severn

lawsuit, a matter related to a fumigation service, has been filed in the Northern Division of the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  The plaintiffs are seeking damages for breach of contract
and negligence.  The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC was also a named defendant in

Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania
as Subrogee of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Agrinational Insurance Company, Inc. as Subrogee of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company,
and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company v. The Industrial Fumigant Co., The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC, and James Miller

.

This lawsuit has been settled resulting in a dismissal of the suit with prejudice on January 24, 2014. Management does not
believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome
of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual
quarter or year.

Orkin, LLC is involved in certain environmental matters primarily
arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company’s liability under any of these matters
would not and did not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan

The Company maintains several noncontributory
tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”) covering employees meeting certain age and service requirements.
The Plans provides benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five years during the last ten years of credited
service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated Social Security covered earnings. The Company
funds the Plans with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company made contributions of $5.0 million, $5.2 million
and $4.9 million to the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.


In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan, although
the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005.  In 2012 the Plan was amended to allow certain
vested terminated participants the ability to elect for a limited time the commencement of their benefit in the form of a single-sum
payment, not to exceed $13,500, or an annuity starting date of December 1, 2012.  In total $4.7 million was paid by the Plan
during the year ended December 31, 2012 under this program. The Plan did not offer this option for the year ended December 31,
2013.

The Company terminated the Waltham Services, LLC Salaried Pension Plan and all benefits have been settled
via an annuity purchase or lump sum in December 2012.  The total payout by the plan was either in the form of lump sum payments
(including rollovers) or annuities.  Active employees were eligible to roll their balances into the Rollins 401(k) Plan.   The
Annuities were purchased through an unaffiliated insurance company.  The total amount disbursed to terminate the plan totaled
$4.0 million.

The Company also includes the Waltham
Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan in the Company’s financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined
benefit plans in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation- Retirement Benefits”, and engages an outside actuary
to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used
on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments
to these liabilities as necessary.

In June 2005, the Company froze the Rollins,
Inc. defined benefit pension plan. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for its defined benefit
post-retirement plans. The funded status of the Plans and the net amount recognized in the statement of financial position are
summarized as follows as of:

The accumulated benefit obligation for
the defined benefit pension plans were $185.9 million and $210.8 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Accumulated
benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the same for the Plans. Pre-tax increases in the pension liability
which were (charged, net of tax) credited to other comprehensive income/(loss) were $45.7 million, $(15.4) million and $(24.5)
million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the
expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in the plan. The expected long-term rate of return
is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.

The discount rate reflects the current rate
at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year.  In estimating this rate, for fiscal
year’s 2013, 2012 and 2011 the Company utilized a yield curve analysis.

For each of the asset categories in the pension
plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level
of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The investment policy establishes a target allocation
for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including individual
market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this
target allocation. The Company and management are considering making contributions to the pension plans of approximately $3.3 million
during fiscal 2014.

Some of our assets, primarily our private equity

and

real estate, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature
of the underlying investments.  For the December 31, 2013 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used
where possible.  For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager statements
combined with

discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.

Additionally, these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which
do not have a readily determinable fair value.  In accordance with ASU No. 2011-12 “Investments In Certain Entities
That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),” these investments are valued based on the net asset value
per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of
the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to
mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial
data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 70 percent of investments
for long-term growth and 30 percent for near-term benefit payments, with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies
and fund managers.  Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies

domiciled domestically and

internationally.  Fixed-income securities include corporate
bonds, mortgage-backed securities,

sovereign bonds

,

and
U.S. Treasuries.  Other types of investments include real estate

funds and private equity
funds that follow several different investment strategies. For each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment
strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to
minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class
which is rebalanced as required.  The plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including

but not limited to

individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which
the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation.

Some of our assets, primarily our private equity, real estate and hedge funds, do not have readily determinable
market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. For the December 31,
2013 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily determinable values,
estimates were derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.

Defined Contribution 401(k) Plan

The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) Plan that is available to a majority of the Company’s
full-time employees the first of the calendar quarter following completion of three months of service. The Plan is available to
non full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one year of service upon completion of 1,000 hours in that
year.  The Plan provides for a matching contribution of fifty cents ($.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant’s
contributions to the Plan that do not exceed 6 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime
and bonuses). The charge to expense for the Company match was approximately $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and
$7.7 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. At December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 approximately,
34.9%, 32.5% and 35.5%, respectively of the plan assets consisted of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total administrative fees paid
by the Company for the Plan were approximately $54 thousand in 2013, $53 thousand in 2012 and $42 thousand in 2011.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan

The Deferred Compensation Plan provides that participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up
to 85% of their annual bonus with respect to any given plan year, subject to a $2 thousand per plan year minimum. The Company may
make discretionary contributions to participant accounts. The Company credited accounts of participants of long service to the
Company with certain discretionary amounts (“Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions”) in lieu of benefits that
previously accrued under the Company's Retirement Income Plan up to a maximum of $245 thousand. The Company made Pension Plan Benefit
Restoration Contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan for five years. The first contribution was made in January 2007
for those participants who were employed for all of the 2006 plan year. Only employees with five full years of vested service on
June 30, 2005 qualified for Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, salary and bonus
deferrals and Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions are fully vested. Any discretionary contributions are subject to vesting
in accordance with the matching contribution vesting schedule set forth in the Rollins 401(k) Plan in which a participant participates.
The Company made its last contributions associated with this plan during the first quarter of 2011.

Accounts will be credited with hypothetical
earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain "Measurement Funds." Account values
are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and Company credits had been converted into shares or other ownership units of selected
Measurement Funds by purchasing (or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current purchase price of the relevant
Measurement Fund at the time of the participant's selection. Deferred Compensation Plan benefits are unsecured general obligations
of the Company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness. The Company has established a "rabbi trust," which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to indirectly
fund any obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the extent that the Company's obligations under the Deferred Compensation
Plan exceed assets available under the trust, the Company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability
under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan provides
for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant's death, disability, retirement or other
termination of employment (a "Termination Event"). However, for any deferrals of salary and bonus (but not Company contributions),
participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a Termination Event. Generally, the Deferred
Compensation Plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan in installments or
lump-sum payments.

At December 31, 2013 the Deferred Compensation Plan had 41 life insurance policies with a net face value of
$37.2 million. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies were worth $11.5 million and $11.2 million at December
31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position and $12.8 million and $11.1 million in deferred compensation
liability as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, located within long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock Compensation Plans

Stock options and time lapse restricted
shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan.

Stock Options

The Company’s stock options generally
vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company issued
approximately 1 thousand shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees and issued 32 thousand shares in 2012.

In order to estimate the fair value of
stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value
of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the

The aggregate intrinsic value in the
table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the
last trading day of the year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that day. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will
change based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock.


The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was
less than $0.1 million, $0.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Exercise of options during the years ended December 31, 2013,
2012 and 2011 resulted in cash receipts of less than $10 thousand, less than $1 thousand, and $0.1 million, respectively.

Time Lapse Restricted Shares and Restricted
Stock Units

TLRSs provide for the issuance of a share
of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from
the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of
the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting
rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be
sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

The Company issued time lapse restricted
shares of 0.5 million, 0.8 million and 0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The Company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2013, approximately
4.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, “

Compensation
– Stock Compensation,”

the Company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight line basis over the service
periods of each award. The Company estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.

The following table summarizes the components of the Company’s
stock-based compensation programs recorded as expense ($ in thousands):
