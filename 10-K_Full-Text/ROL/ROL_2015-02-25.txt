I

Item 1.

Business

General

Rollins,
Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting,
Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control
services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America and Australia with
international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico.
Services are performed through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, LLC. (“Orkin”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s
largest pest and termite control company. It provides customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin either serves customers,
directly or franchises operations, in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean,
Europe, Africa, and Mexico providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects
to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies.
Orkin operates under the Orkin

®

, and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service
mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States.
The Orkin Canada brand name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin
Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada’s largest pest
control provider and a leader in the development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western
Pest Services (“Western”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin
offers focusing on the northeastern United States.

The
Industrial Fumigant Company (“IFC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins,
Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam
Pest Defense (“HomeTeam”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins,
Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx

®

tubes in the wall pest control
system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services
home builders nationally.

Rollins
Australia (“Rollins Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”),
in February 2014. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional commercial,
residential, and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity
program and provides specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.

The
Company has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets
for this segment, which includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia,
the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico are included in Item 8 of this document, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” on pages 26 and 27. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any
single customer or a few customers or the Company’s foreign operations.

Common
Stock Repurchase Program

Unless
stated otherwise, all share and per share data are presented prior to the three-for-two stock split effective March 10, 2015.
At the July 2012 Board of Directors’ meeting, the Board authorized the purchase of 5.0 million shares of the Company’s
common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company repurchased on the open market 1.0 million and 0.3
million shares at a weighted average price of $29.19 and $24.56, respectively. In total, there are 4.0 million additional shares
authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.


Backlog

Backlog
services and orders are usually provided within the month following the month of order receipt, except in the area of prepaid
pest control and bait monitoring services, which are usually provided within twelve months of order receipt. The Company does
not have a material portion of its business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the
election of a governmental entity.

Orkin
Franchises

The
Company continues to expand its growth through Orkin’s franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets
where it is currently not economically feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are subject to a contractual
buyback provision at Orkin’s option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise.
International franchise agreements also contain an optional buyback provision; however, the franchisee has the prior right of
renewal of agreement. The Company through its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994,
and established its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean,
the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico.

Seasonality

The
business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase
in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined
by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the Company’s pest and
termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The
Company has relationships with a national pest control product distributor and other vendors for pest and termite control treatment
products. The Company maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing
needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers.

Competition

The
Company believes that Rollins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, Orkin Canada, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest
Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, TruTech, Permatreat, and Rollins Australia competes
favorably with competitors as the world’s largest pest and termite control company. The Company’s competitors include
Terminix, Ecolab and Rentokil.

The
principal methods of competition in the Company’s pest and termite control business are quality of service and guarantees,
including service quality, and product availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, and price.

Research
and Development

Expenditures
by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the
new and improved service methods and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies.
Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.


The
Company maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material
selection.

The
Company conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products.  The Company also works closely
with leading scientists, educators, industry consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.

Environmental
and Regulatory Considerations

The
Company’s pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect
the environment, public health and consumers. Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Federal
Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act (“FIFRA”)

This
federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which
pest control companies operate. Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the
following: licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This allows
each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens’
wishes in each state. The pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food
Quality Protection Act of 1996 (“FQPA”)

The
FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts
its business.

Environmental
Remediation

The
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, is the primary
Federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible
parties. Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous
substances, and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will
work with the EPA and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation.
Consistent with the Company’s responsibilities under these regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments
and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As
these situations arise, the Company accrues management’s best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management’s
current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the Company’s financial condition
or operating results.

Employees

The
number of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2015 was approximately 11,000.

as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically
filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1.A.

Risk Factors

We
may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.

We
operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices, and
general economic issues. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies,
for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service
quality, and product availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe
that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent, we cannot assure investors that we will be able
to maintain our competitive position.

Economic
conditions may adversely affect our business

Pest
and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers. As consumers restrict their discretionary
expenditures, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect
our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly
sensitive to adverse economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or
cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.

We
may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions
have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure investors that we will be able
to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure investors that
we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Any inability
on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

Our
operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

Our
operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions across the United States and Canada. The business of the Company is
affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity,
as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the
change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company’s pest and termite
control operations during such periods. The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which
can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods.

Our
inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our
ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our
ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees
is high, and the supply is very limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction
in our skilled labor force, increases in wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and
profitability could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

Our
operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.

In
the normal course of business, some of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations,
which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged.  The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation,
either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position; however, it is
possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material
to the results of an individual year

.

Our
operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our
business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes
in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and
regulations, how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, or whether additional
laws and regulations will be adopted. We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state
environmental laws and regulations. We also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations
to date. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in
the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include
cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.


The
Company’s Management Has a Substantial Ownership Interest; Public Stockholders May Have No Effective Voice In the Company’s
Management

The
Company has elected the “Controlled Company” exemption under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
Listed Company Manual. The Company is a “Controlled Company” because a group that includes the Company’s Chairman
of the Board, R. Randall Rollins and his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and a
director of the Company and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company’s
voting power. As a “Controlled Company,” the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.

Rollins,
Inc.’s executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the
aggregate, approximately 57 percent of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will
effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions
such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the
effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Item 1.B.

Unresolved Staff Comments

None

Item 2.

Properties.

The
Company’s administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia
30324. The Company owns or leases over 500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins
Training Center located in Atlanta, Georgia, the Rollins Customer Service Center located in Covington, Georgia, and the Pacific
Division Administration and Training Center in Riverside, California. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents
a materially important physical property of the Company. The facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably
anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

In the
normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases
and claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business.
We are actively contesting each of these matters.

Presently,
the Company and a subsidiary, The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC, are named defendants in

Severn Peanut Co. and Meherrin
Agriculture & Chemical Co. v. Industrial Fumigant Co., et al.

The

Severn

lawsuit, a matter related to a fumigation
service, has been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  The court dismissed
plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contract on March 15, 2014, and it dismissed plaintiffs’ only remaining claim (negligence)
on December 15, 2014. Plaintiffs have appealed the rulings.

On April
29, 2014, Foster Poultry Farms sued Orkin, LLC and Orkin Services of California, Inc., for breach of contract, breach of covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, and negligence.  The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California.  Foster Farms is seeking damages related to pest control services performed at its chicken processing
facility during a nine month period. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.

On December
2, 2014, Plaintiff Killian Pest Control sued Rollins, Inc., its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense, and alleged that HomeTeam’s
exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, and California’s
Cartwright Act and Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates
the Sherman and Cartwright Acts, and the Business and Professions Code; a permanent injunction against continuing alleged violations;
and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. The Company
cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, because the lawsuit is at an early stage and involves unresolved issues of law and
fact. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.

On December
2, 2014, Plaintiff Jose Luis Garnica, on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated customers, sued Rollins, Inc., its
subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense, and alleged that HomeTeam’s exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system
violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act. The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the
Sherman Act; a permanent injunction against continuing violations; and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United
States District Court, Northern District of California. The Company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, because the lawsuit
is at an early stage and involves unresolved issues of law and fact. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.

Management
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual quarter or year.

As of
January 31, 2015, there were 2,135 holders of record of the Company’s common stock.

However,
a large number of our shareholders hold their shares in “street name” in brokerage accounts and, therefore, do not appear
on the shareholder list maintained by our transfer agent.

On January 27, 2015, the Board of Directors at its quarterly meeting authorized a three-for-two stock split
of the Company’s common shares by the issuance on March 10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares
held of record at February 10, 2015. The stock split will increase the Company’s outstanding shares from approximately 145,783,052
to 218,674,578 shares. Our historical outstanding shares will be recast upon distribution.

On
January 27, 2015 the Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend per common share of $0.12 payable March 10, 2015 to
stockholders of record at the close of business February 10, 2015. On October 28, 2014, the Board of Directors declared a special
year-end dividend of $0.10 per share payable December 10, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10,
2014. The Company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to the common stockholders, subject to the earnings and financial
condition of the Company and other relevant factors.

Results
of Operations—2014 Versus 2013

Overview

The
Company’s gross margin increased to 49.9% for 2014 from 49.3% in 2013. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased
in 2014 to 31.3% of revenue versus 32.0% in 2013. The Company’s depreciation and amortization margin increased 0.1 point
to 3.1 % in 2014 compared to 3.0% in 2013. The Company had net income of $137.7 million in 2014 compared to $123.3 million in
2013, an 11.6% increase. Net profit margin improved to 9.8% in 2014 from 9.2% in 2013.

Revenues

Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $1.412 billion, an increase of $74.2 million or 5.5% from 2013 revenues of $1.337 billion.
Commercial pest control represented approximately 41% of the Company’s business in 2014 and grew 6.7% in 2014 due to increases
in sales and bed bug revenues and acquisitions. Residential pest control represented approximately 41% of the Company’s
business and increased 4.5% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing as well as increased capture of TAEXX

®

homebuilder installations,
bed bug revenues and acquisitions. The Company’s termite business, which represented approximately 17% of the Company’s
revenue, grew 5.0% in 2014 due to increases in ancillary service sales as well as increases in customers from cross-selling campaigns,
and acquisitions.


The
Company implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2014. Less than 2.0% of the Company’s revenue increase
came from pricing actions. The Company’s acquisitions accounted for less than 2% of the revenue increase. Nearly 80.0% of
the Company’s revenue was recurring in 2014 and 2013.

The
Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013. The Company established new franchises in Brazil, China, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Puerto Rico Saudi
Arabia, Uruguay, and the US Virgin Islands in 2014 for a total of 37 international franchises at December 31, 2014 with 26 at
December 31, 2013. Orkin had 92 and 80 total domestic and international franchises at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Cost
of Services Provided

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 cost of services provided increased $29.3 million or 4.3%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2013. Gross margin for the year was 49.9% for 2014 and 49.3% for 2013 due to favorable termite and casualty
claim development, reduced fleet costs and good cost controls across most spending categories.

Depreciation
and Amortization

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, depreciation and amortization increased $3.9 million, or 10.0% compared to the twelve
months ended December 31, 2013. The dollar increase was due primarily to amortization related to acquisitions that occurred over
the previous 12 months. The increase is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in late 2013 and early 2014 partially
offset by several fixed and intangible assets being fully depreciated or amortized.

Sales,
General and Administrative

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $13.4 million, or 3.1%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 representing 31.3% of revenues compared to 32.0% of revenues in the prior
year. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased due to the Company being able to leverage our administrative and sales salaries
against higher revenues, along with a lower advertising run rate than the prior year.

Gain
on Sales of assets, Net

Gain
on sales of assets, net increased to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.2 million gain in 2013.
The Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and property in 2014 and 2013.

Interest
(Income)/Expense, Net

Interest
(income)/expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $0.3 million income, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to $0.4
million in 2013. Interest income for the year is due to interest received on cash balances in the Company’s various cash
accounts.

Taxes

The
Company’s effective tax rate was 37.3% in 2014 compared to 35.6% in 2013, due primarily to state and foreign income taxes,
and the release of certain deferred tax liabilities in 2013.

Results
of Operations—2013 Versus 2012

Overview

The Company’s gross margin increased to 49.3% for 2013 from 49.0% in 2012. Sales, general and administrative
expense decreased in 2013 to 32.0% of revenue versus 32.1% in 2012. The Company remained flat in its depreciation and amortization
margin at 3.0% in 2013 and 2012. The Company had net income of $123.3 million in 2013 compared to $111.3 million in 2012, a 10.8%
increase. Net profit margin improved to 9.2% in 2013 from 8.8% in 2012.

Revenues

Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $1.337 billion, an increase of $66.4 million or 5.2% from 2012 revenues of $1.271 billion.
Commercial pest control represented approximately 41% of the Company’s business in 2013 and grew 4.9% in 2013 due to increases
in sales and bed bug revenues. Residential pest control represented approximately 41% of the Company’s business and increased
6.1% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing as well as increased capture of TAEXX

®

homebuilder installations. The Company’s
termite business, which represented approximately 17% of the Company’s revenue, grew 4.5% in 2013 due to increases in ancillary
service sales as well as the Company’s expanded sales force and price improvement.


The
Company implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2013 which had a positive impact on the year’s revenue.
Less than 2.0% of the Company’s revenue increase came from pricing actions. Nearly 80% of the Company’s revenue was
recurring in 2013 and 2012.

The
Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012. The Company established new franchises in Guam, Iraq, Trinidad and Tobago and St. Lucia in 2013 for a total of 26 international
franchises at December 31, 2013 with 22 at December 31, 2012. Orkin had 80 and 79 total domestic and international franchises
at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Cost
of Services Provided

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 cost of services provided increased $30.9 million or 4.8%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2012. Gross margin for the year was 49.3% for 2013 and 49.0% for 2012. While most costs increased during the
year due to the Company’s early 2013 and late 2012 acquisitions, service salaries, personnel related costs and materials
and supplies increased due to increased sales, increased TAEXX

®

installations and higher group medical insurance premiums. These
costs were partially offset by lower insurance and claims costs.

Depreciation
and Amortization

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, depreciation and amortization increased $0.9 million, or 2.4% compared to the twelve
months ended December 31, 2012. The increase is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in late 2012 and early 2013
partially offset by several fixed and intangible assets being fully depreciated or amortized.

Sales,
General and Administrative

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $20.8 million, or 5.1%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 representing 32.0% of revenues compared to 32.1% of revenues in the prior
year. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased due to reduced salaries as a percentage of revenues as the Company continues
to maximize efficiency in its workforce and bad debt expense as the Company continues its focus on collections. The reductions
as a percentage of SG&A are partially offset by increases in professional services due to timing of various information technology
projects and higher advertising expenses due to the Company’s new ad campaigns.

Interest
(Income)/Expense, Net

Interest
(income)/expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.4 million income, an increase of $0.4 million compared to $14
thousand expense in 2012. Interest income for the year is due to interest received on cash balances in the Company’s various
cash accounts.

Gain
on Sales of assets, Net

Gain
on sales of assets, net decreased to $0.2 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $0.5 million gain in 2012.
The Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and property in 2013 and 2012.

Taxes

The
Company’s effective tax rate was 35.6% in 2013 compared to 37.0% in 2012, due primarily to differences in state tax rates
and foreign income taxes and the release of certain deferred tax liabilities.

Cash
Provided by Operating Activities

The
Company’s operations generated cash of $194.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily from net income of
$137.7 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $162.7 million in 2013 and $141.9 million in 2012. The
Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities
and available borrowings under its $175.0 million credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations,
and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future.

The
Company made contributions totaling $5.3 million to the Rollins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ defined benefit
retirement plans (the “Plans”) during the year ended December 31, 2014 and $5.0 million and $5.2 million during the
years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, as a result of the Plans’ funding status. The Company is considering
making contributions to its Plans of approximately $3.3 million during fiscal 2015. In the opinion of management, additional Plan
contributions will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Cash
Used in Investing Activities

The
Company used $89.5 million on investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $30.8 million and $42.7
million during 2013 and 2012, respectively, and of that, invested approximately $28.7 million in capital expenditures during
2014 compared to $18.6 million and $19.0 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year
consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology related projects. The Company expects to
invest between $20.0 million and $25.0 million in 2015 in capital expenditures. During 2014, the Company’s subsidiaries
acquired several small companies totaling $63.3 million compared to $12.6 million in acquisitions during 2013 and $25.0
million in 2012. The expenditures for the Company’s acquisitions were funded with cash on hand and stock in one instance. The
Company continues to seek new acquisitions.

Cash
Provided by Financing Activities

The Company used cash of $106.5 million on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared
to $75.7 million and $81.0 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively. A total of $75.8 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.52
per share) during the year ended December 31, 2014 including a special dividend paid in December 2014 of $0.10 per share compared
to $65.7 million paid in cash dividends ($0.45 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2013 including a special dividend
paid in December 2013 of $0.09 per share, compared to $64.3 million ($0.44 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2012 including
a special dividend paid in December 2012 of $0.12 per share.

The
Company used $29.3 million to repurchase on the open market 1.0 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price
of $29.19 per share during 2014 compared to $8.4 million to purchase 0.3 million shares at an average price of $24.56 in 2013
and $16.4 million to purchase 0.8 million shares at a weighted average price of $20.93 in 2012. There remain 4.0 million shares
authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. In addition to the shares purchased on the open market, the Company repurchased
$6.2 million, $5.3 million and $3.5 million of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively,
from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.

The Company’s $108.4 million of total cash at December 31, 2014, is primarily cash held at various banking
institutions. Approximately $35.0 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $73.3 million
is primarily held in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various
domestic banks which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.

The
Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future
through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash
from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The
Company maintains a large cash position in the United States while having no third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains
adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations
and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business.

On
October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured
line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline
subfacility. The Credit Agreement was amended on October 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2018 and add three
optional one year extensions. As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline
subfacility. The Company maintains approximately $35.5 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the
Company’s fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured status, to secure various
workers’ compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets,
funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.


The Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity
date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2018, subject to up to three optional extensions of the Credit Agreement for one year
each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company’s
election:

●

the
Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative Agent publicly announces from time
to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate
(which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the U.S. Federal Reserve) determined
on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month,

plus

1.0% per annum.

●

with
respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus an additional amount, which varies between .75% and 1.00%,
based upon Rollins’ then-current debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2014, the additional rate allocated was .75%.

The
Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants
including covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate
with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants
restricting the Company’s ability to permit the ratio of the Company’s consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain
limits.

The
Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2014 and expects to maintain compliance throughout
2015.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
Company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition
and results of operations, and that require management’s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances
that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual
for Termite Contracts

— The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs
of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite
control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It
is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s
business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. Accruals for termite
contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated
statements of financial position.

Accrued
Insurance

— The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability,
workers’ compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance
program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual
settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating
to such claims. The Company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an
estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing
the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current
balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge
and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. The Company
continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. Initiatives that have
been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer
physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing. The Company has improved the time required
to report a claim by utilizing a “Red Alert” program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a
day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a
limited-duty basis.


Revenue
Recognition

— The Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time
services are performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing
of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are
primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may
receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and
revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for
those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and
recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as
a reduction in revenues.

Termite
baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting
services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the
monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the
contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis
over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing
monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There
are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal
revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing
the required monitoring visits.

Revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are
expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon
current factors and historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and
while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term.
As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals
applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite
services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

All
revenues are reported net of sales taxes.

Contingency
Accruals

— The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the
litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately
predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation
are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management,
the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.

Defined
benefit pension plans

— In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals
under the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through
June 2005. The Company terminated the Waltham Services, LLC Salaried Pension Plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity
purchase or lump sum distribution in December 2012. The Company also includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension
Plan to the Company’s financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the
FASB ASC Topic 715

“Compensation- Retirement Benefits”

, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations
and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including
the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as
necessary.

The
Company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes,
the investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets
and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects
future pension expense. The Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from
the prior year.

The
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year.
In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company’s
expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will
mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount
rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from
the corporate bonds. The discount rate was 4.15% as of December 31, 2014 compared to 5.20% in 2013 and 4.17% in 2012. A lower
discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.


As set forth in note 13 to the Company’s financial statements, included among the asset categories for
the Plan’s investments are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate
and hedge funds. These investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs
which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-12
“

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),”

these investments
are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are
subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of
these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments
and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness.

As
of December 31, 2014, the defined benefit plans were under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive
income decreased stockholders’ equity by $41.7 million before tax and $25.6 million after tax.

New
Accounting Standards

Recently
adopted accounting standards

In February
2013, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2013-02,
Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02) to Comprehensive Income. The guidance
requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding
effect on the respective line items of net income. The provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our
2014 fiscal year. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations
or financial position.

In February
2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements
for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).
This guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the
total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date. This stipulates that (1) it will
include the amount the entity agreed to pay for the arrangement between them and the other entities that are also obligated to
the liability and (2) any additional amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of the other entities. The objective of this update
is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements. The provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. Adoption of this new
guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In July
2013, the FASB issued ASU No 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating
Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. Topic 740, Income Taxes, does not include explicit
guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar
tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. There is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits
in those instances. Some entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit is directly
associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in, or that resulted in, the recognition of a net operating loss
or tax credit carryforward for that year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized. Other entities
present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward in
certain circumstances. The objective of the amendments in this Update is to eliminate that diversity in practice. The provision
of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material
impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

Recently
issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2015 or later

In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205 and 360): Reporting
Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposals of Components of an Entity. ASU 2014-08 amends the definition for what types
of asset disposals are to be considered discontinued operations, and amends the required disclosures for discontinued operations
and assets held for sale. ASU 2014-08 also enhances the convergence of the FASB’s and the International Accounting Standard
Board’s reporting requirements for discontinued operations. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. We do not expect this standard
to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): “Revenue
from Contracts with Customers” (ASU 2014-09) which requires companies to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control
rather than when companies have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service. ASU 2014-09 is effective
retrospectively for the annual or interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s
reported results of operations or financial position.

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Topic
225): Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (ASU 2015-01) eliminate the GAAP concept of extraordinary items. The new
guidance eliminates the separate presentation of extraordinary items, net of tax and the related earnings per share, but does not
affect the requirement to disclose material items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. The amendments in this
update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
on or after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.


Forward-Looking
Statements

This
Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding management’s belief that environmental remediation costs estimated
to be incurred are not material to the Company’s financial condition or operating results; the outcome of litigation, as
discussed in the Legal Proceedings section and elsewhere, and the Company’s belief that such litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; the Company’s expectation
to continue its payment of cash dividends; management’s belief that it has identified many opportunities to improve its
business in the future; the adequacy of the Company’s resources and borrowings to fund operations and obligations; management’s
belief that any additional pension plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position,
results of operation or liquidity; the Company’s projected 2015 capital expenditures; the plans to expand Orkin’s
franchise program and to grow in foreign markets through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings and through acquisitions;
the Company’s expectation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in its Revolving Credit Agreement throughout
2015; the impact and amount of the Company’s contractual obligations; management’s expectations regarding termite
claims and factors that impact future costs from those claims; the expected cost of termite renewals; the expected collectability
of accounts receivable; expected tax consequences; the impact of recent accounting pronouncements; and interest rate risks and
foreign exchange currency risk on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. The actual results
of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks, timing
and uncertainties including, without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling against the Company in pending litigation;
general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or technologies; the degree of success of the Company’s
termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods; the Company’s ability to identify potential acquisitions;
climate and weather trends; competitive factors and pricing practices; potential increases in labor costs; and changes in various
government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond
the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause
its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market
Risk

The
Company maintains an investment portfolio subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company is also subject to interest
rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175 million credit facility. Currently, the Company has no outstanding borrowings.
However, the Company does maintain approximately $35.5 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is also exposed to market risks
arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material
effect upon the Company’s results of operations or financial position going forward.


MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the
Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The
management of Rollins, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for the Company. Rollins, Inc. maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at
a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and
can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection
and training of qualified personnel. This system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting,
as of December 31, 2014 based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management’s assessment is that Rollins,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.

The
independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2014, and has also issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting, included in this report on page 24.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Board of Directors and Stockholders’

Rollins, Inc.

We have audited the internal control
over financial reporting of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2014, based on criteria established in the, 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established
in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our report dated February 25, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE

Board of Directors and Stockholders’

Rollins, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial position of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. Our audits of the basic consolidated financial statements
included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15. These financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rollins, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 25, 2015 expressed
an unqualified opinion.

SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business
Description

—Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state
of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control
services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America with international
franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico. Services are
performed through a contract that specifies service frequency and the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin,
LLC. (“Orkin”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite
control company. It provides customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin serves customers, either directly, or franchise
operations, in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa,
and Mexico providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses,
including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under
the Orkin

®

, and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand
name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin
Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada’s largest
pest control provider and a leader in the development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western
Pest Services (“Western”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in
2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers
focusing on the northeastern United States.

The
Industrial Fumigant Company (“IFC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins,
Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam
Pest Defense (“HomeTeam”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx® tubes in the wall pest control system, was recognized
as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders nationally.

Rollins
Australia (“Rollins Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”),
in February 2014. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional residential,
commercial and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity program
and provides specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.

The
Company has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets
for this segment, includes the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean,
Europe, Africa, and Mexico. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single
customer, few customers or foreign operations.

Principles
of Consolidation

— The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Rollins, Inc. and
our wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).
The Company does not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership interest of 50% or
less. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest
entity. Accordingly, the Company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. The Company reclassified certain prior period
amounts, none of which were material, to conform to the current period presentation. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.

Subsequent
Events

—The Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. On February
2, 2015 we announced that Harry J. Cynkus, CFO of Rollins, Inc. would retire in 2015. Eddie Northen is expected to succeed Harry
Cynkus as CFO effective May 1, 2015.

Three-for-two
stock split

—The Board of Directors at its quarterly meeting on January 27, 2015, authorized a three-for-two stock split
by the issuance on March 10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at February 10, 2015.
Unless otherwise stated all share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are
presented prior to this stock split.


Estimates
Used in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

— The Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services
are performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing
services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring
in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments
within a given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the
time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full
year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered.
The Company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite
baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting
services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the
monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the
contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis
over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing
monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There
are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal
revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing
the required monitoring visits.

Revenue received for conventional termite
renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is
made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance
of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial
number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of
reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as
incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected
revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

All
revenues are reported net of sales taxes.

The
Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013,
and 2012.

Interest
income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. Recognition of
initial franchise fee revenues occurs when all material services or conditions relating to a new agreement have been
substantially performed or satisfied by the Company, initial franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the
Statement of Financial Position until such time. Royalties from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as
earned on a monthly basis. Gains on sales of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at the time of sale
and when collection is reasonably assured.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability
of accounts receivable.  Management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine
the expected collectability of accounts receivable.  Substantially all of the Company’s receivables are due from pest
control and termite services in the United States and selected international locations.  The Company’s allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability.
The Company’s established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk
customers. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written-off
against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts
previously written off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the
period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. There were
no large recoveries in 2014, 2013, and 2012.  We record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer’s inability
to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating
results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables
would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.

Advertising

costs are charged to sales, general and administrative expense during the year in which they are incurred.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

— The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates
fair market value.

The Company’s $108.4 million of total cash at December 31, 2014, is primarily cash held at various banking
institutions. Approximately $35.0 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $73.3 million
is primarily held in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various
domestic banks which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.

The
Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future
through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash
from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The
Company maintains a large cash position in the United States while having little third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains
adequate liquidity and capital resources without regard to its foreign deposits that are directed to finance domestic operations
and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business for the foreseeable future.

Marketable
Securities

— From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial
institutions. The Company’s investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than “investment
grade” by national rating services.

Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of
each balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to
hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value
judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included as a component of interest income.

The
Company had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined pension benefit plan and the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan at December 31, 2014 and 2013. See note 13 for further details.

Materials
and Supplies

—Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Income Taxes

—The Company provides for income taxes
based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)topic 740 “Income
Taxes”, which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The Company provides an allowance for deferred
tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. The Company
establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain
certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold. The Company's policy is to record interest and penalties related
to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Equipment
and Property

—Equipment and Property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which includes the amortization
of assets recorded under capital leases and are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are computed using the following asset lives: buildings, ten to forty
years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, two to ten years. Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments
are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise
disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal
with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. The annual provisions for depreciation, below, have been reflected
in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets—

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 350,

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”

,
the Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization;
(2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. The Company does not amortize intangible
assets with indefinite lives and goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic
downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the Company
level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with
its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, then the Company will compare the
implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill
is less than its carrying value.  The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing
the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge
if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its most recent annual impairment analyses
as of September 30, 2014. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill
or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets—

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 360,

“Property, Plant and Equipment”

, the
Company’s long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future
cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value
of the asset. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including
customer contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Insurance

—The
Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’ compensation and vehicle
liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical
trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future
periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent third
party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The
actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in business
practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of
factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication
of future events.

Accrual
for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors
that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual
number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible
to precisely predict future significant claims. An accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and
long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Contingency
Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.
In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

management estimates and accrues for its liability
and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because
it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities
and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued.
However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued
liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Three-for-two
stock split

—The Board of Directors at its quarterly meeting on January 27, 2015, authorized a three-for-two stock split
by the issuance on March 10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at February 10, 2015.
Unless otherwise stated all share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are
presented prior to this stock split.

Earnings
Per Share—

the FASB ASC Topic 260-10

“Earnings Per Share- Overall,”

requires a basic earnings per share
and diluted earnings per share presentation. Further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is
required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.

The
Company has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are
considered participating securities. See note 14 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.


The
basic and diluted calculations differ as a result of the dilutive effect of stock options included in diluted earnings per share,
but excluded from basic earnings per share. Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods.

A
reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common
stock (participating securities) is as follows (in thousands except per share data). All share and per share information in the
following chart are stated prior to the stock split effective March 10, 2015:

Translation
of Foreign Currencies

—Assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated
into U.S. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates
for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from
foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign
currency are included in the earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based
Compensation

— The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718 “

Compensation
– Stock Compensation

.” Stock options and time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and
other management employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan. The Company’s stock options generally
vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain
stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. Outstanding TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments
starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive
all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued
provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.
The fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years.

The
Company has not granted stock options since 2003.


Comprehensive
Income (Loss)

—Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) results from foreign currency translations and minimum pension liability
adjustments.

Franchising
Program

—Rollins’ wholly-owned subsidiary,

Orkin,
had 55, 54 and 57 domestic franchises as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Transactions with domestic franchises
involve sales of customer contracts to establish new franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts
and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods ranging up to five years. Notes
receivable from franchises were $4.2 million at December 31, 2014 and $4.1 million at December 31, 2013. These amounts are included
as financing receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The
Company recognizes gains from the sale of customer contracts at the time they are sold to franchises and collection on the notes
is reasonably assured. The Company recognized net gains of $0.1 million, $0.2 million, and $0.5 million for the years ended December
31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively for the sale of customer contracts. These amounts are included as revenues in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income.

All
domestic franchises have a guaranteed repurchase clause that the franchise may be repurchased by Orkin at a later date once it
has been established; therefore, initial domestic franchise fees are deferred in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor
Revenue Recognition

,” for the duration of the initial contract period and are included as unearned revenue in the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position. Deferred franchise fees were $3.0 million, $2.9 million, and $3.0 million at December 31, 2014,
2013, and 2012, respectively.

Royalties
from franchises are accrued and recognized in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,”
as revenues are earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from franchises was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $3.9
million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

As of
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, Orkin had 37, 26, and 22 international franchises, respectively. Orkin’s international
franchise program began with its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America,
the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico.

The
Company’s maximum exposure to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to the franchises
was $1.2 million, $1.2 million, and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

New
Accounting Standards

Recently
adopted accounting standards

In February
2013, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2013-02,
Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02) to Comprehensive Income. The guidance
requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding
effect on the respective line items of net income. The provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our
2014 fiscal year. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations
or financial position.

In February
2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements
for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).
This guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the
total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date. This stipulates that (1) it will
include the amount the entity agreed to pay for the arrangement between them and the other entities that are also obligated to
the liability and (2) any additional amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of the other entities. The objective of this update
is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements. The provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. Adoption of this new
guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In
July 2013,

the FASB issued ASU No

2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar
Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. Topic 740, Income Taxes, does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement
presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward
exists. There is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in those instances. Some entities present
unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit is directly associated with a tax position taken
in a tax year that results in, or that resulted in, the recognition of a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward for that
year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized. Other entities present unrecognized tax benefits
as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward in certain circumstances. The objective
of the amendments in this Update is to eliminate that diversity in practice.

The provision of the new guidance was effective
as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s
reported results of operations or financial position.


Recently
issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2015 or later

In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205 and 360): Reporting
Discontinued Operations and Disclosure of Disposals of Components of an Entity. ASU 2014-08 amends the definition for what types
of asset disposals are to be considered discontinued operations, and amends the required disclosures for discontinued operations
and assets held for sale. ASU 2014-08 also enhances the convergence of the FASB’s and the International Accounting Standard
Board’s reporting requirements for discontinued operations. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. We do not expect this standard
to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): “Revenue
from Contracts with Customers” (ASU 2014-09) which requires companies to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control
rather than when companies have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service. ASU 2014-09 is effective
retrospectively for the annual or interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s
reported results of operations or financial position.

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Topic
225): Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (ASU 2015-01) eliminate the GAAP concept of extraordinary items. The new
guidance eliminates the separate presentation of extraordinary items, net of tax and the related earnings per share, but does not
affect the requirement to disclose material items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. The amendments in this
update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
on or after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

ACQUISITIONS

The
Company has made several acquisitions that are not material individually or in total to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.

Rollins
Australia (“Rollins Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”),
in February 2014. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional commercial,
residential, and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity program
and provides specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.

Acquisition
of Wilco Enterprises, Inc. (sole holder of PermaTreat Exterminating Company, Inc. d/b/a PermaTreat Pest Control, Inc.) (“PermaTreat”)
– The Company completed the acquisition of PermaTreat effective August 1, 2014. PermaTreat is a leading pest control company
located in Central and Northern Virginia and was founded in 1967. The Company issued 582,233 shares of its $1 par value
common stock valued at $28.19 per share to Joseph R. Wilson and Jack Broome. A valuation of the acquired assets is currently being
performed and an estimate has been recorded in the Company’s financial statements. The effect of any adjustments to these
estimates for PermaTreat is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements as the net total
adjustment will affect a combination of goodwill, customer contracts, and other intangible assets at the end of the measurement
period.

Total
cash purchase price for the Company’s acquisitions in 2014 was $63.3 million, and the Company issued common stock as purchase
price in acquisition having a total value of $16.4 million.

DEBT

On
October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured
line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline
subfacility. The Credit Agreement was amended on October 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2018 and add three
optional one year extensions.

As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under
the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately $35.5 million in letters of credit.
These letters of credit are required by the Company’s fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s
self-insured status, to secure various workers’ compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes
that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

The Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity
date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2018, subject to up to three optional extensions of the Credit Agreement for one year
each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company’s
election:

●

the
                                         Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative
                                         Agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal
                                         Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals
                                         LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the
                                         U.S. Federal Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month,

plus

1.0% per annum.

●

with
                                         respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus an additional amount,
                                         which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon Rollins’ then-current debt-to-EBITDA
                                         ratio. As of December 31, 2014, the additional rate allocated was .75%.

The
Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants
including covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate
with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants
restricting the Company’s ability to permit the ratio of the Company’s consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain
limits.

The
Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2014 and expects to maintain compliance throughout
2015.

TRADE
                                         RECEIVABLES

The
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency
aging totals, based on contractual terms, for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company
policies that are specific to pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

FINANCING
                                         RECEIVABLES

Rollins
manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. The Company’s credit
risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising Rollins’ customer base and dispersion across many different
geographical regions. The credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an assessment of
the individual’s beacon/credit bureau score. Rollins requires potential obligor to have good credit worthiness with low risk
before entering into a contract. Depending upon the individual’s credit score the Company may accept with 100% financing
or require a significant down payment or turndown the contract. Delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. Financing
receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.

Total
financing receivables, net were $24.0 million and $23.8 million at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Financing
receivables are charged-off when deemed uncollectable or when 180 days have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual
payment. The Company’s charge-off policy has been consistently applied and no significant changes have been made to the policy
during the periods reported. Management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. Gross charge-offs as a percentage of average financing receivables were 3.1% and 2.7% for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Due to the low percentage of charge-off receivables and the high
credit worthiness of the potential obligor, the entire Rollins, Inc. financing receivables portfolio has a low credit risk.

The
Company offers 90 days same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their credit worthiness. Interest is not recognized until
the 91st day at which time it is recognized retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. In
certain circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest
when they reach 180 days past due. As of December 31, 2014, there were no accounts on a non-accrual status, and no financing receivables
greater than 180 days past due.

Included
in financing receivables are notes receivable from franchise owners. These notes are low risk as the repurchase of these franchises
is guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, Inc., and the repurchase price of the franchise is currently
estimated and has historically been well above the receivable due from the franchise owner.

The
carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of
contracts. Long-Term Installment receivables, net were $11.8 million and $11.6 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Rollins
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to insure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The
allowance balance is comprised of a general reserve, which is determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance,
and a specific reserve, which is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy
or other events, that make it unlikely that Rollins will recover its investment. The general reserve percentages are based on
several factors, which include consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted-average
risk rating of the portfolio and information derived from competitive benchmarking.

The
allowance for doubtful accounts related to financing receivables was as follows:

FAIR
                                         VALUE MEASUREMENT

The
Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables,
accounts payable, and other short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair
values. The Company has financial instruments related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed
in note 13.

The
fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair
values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using
significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.

The
following table presents our nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31,
2014.

surrender value of these life insurance policies had a net realizable value of $12.7 million and $11.5 million at December 31,
2014 and 2013, respectively. The total deferred compensation plan assets, recorded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated
statements of financial position, were $13.7 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.
The carrying amount of goodwill was $255.6 million as of December 31, 2014 and $211.8 million as of December 31, 2013. Goodwill
increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to acquisitions and currency conversion of foreign goodwill. The carrying
amount of goodwill in foreign countries was $42.7 million as of December 31, 2014 and $9.2 million as of December 31, 2013. The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 30, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

CUSTOMER
                                         CONTRACTS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Customer
contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio
that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance
with the FASB ASC Topic 350

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”,

the expected lives of customer contracts were
reviewed, and it was determined that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of 7 to 20 years dependent upon customer
type. The carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:

The
Provision for Income Taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.3% on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December
31, 2014. The effective rate differs from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes.

For
2013 and 2012 the effective tax rate was 35.6% and 37.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual
federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes and the release of certain deferred tax liabilities.

During
2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company paid income taxes of $74.5 million, $69.4 million and $63.0 million, respectively, net of refunds.


Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities

As
of December 31, 2014, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately
$195.5 million, which will be available to offset future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between
2015 and 2028. Management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $15.5 million of foreign net operating
losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards.
The valuation allowance increased by $1.2 million due to the foreign net operating losses.

Earnings
from continuing operations before income tax includes foreign income of $16.2 million, $17.0 million, and $15.6 million in
2014, 2013, and 2013, respectively. The Company’s international business is expanding and we
intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and
future earnings as well as acquisition of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries is not part of the Company’s current business plan.

There
were no unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax
benefits is as follows:

The
Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various state and international jurisdictions that are currently under audit for
years ranging from 2007 through 2013. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S.,
income tax examinations for years prior to 2010.

It
is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase in the next 12 months.

The
Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest
and penalties were $0.5 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. During 2014 the
Company recognized interest and penalties of $0.1 million.

In
accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing
the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative
to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

In the
normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases
and claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business.
We are actively contesting each of these matters.

Presently,
the Company and a subsidiary, The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC, are named defendants in

Severn Peanut Co. and Meherrin
Agriculture & Chemical Co. v. Industrial Fumigant Co., et al.

The

Severn

lawsuit, a matter related to a fumigation
service, has been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  The court dismissed
plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contract on March 15, 2014, and it dismissed plaintiffs’ only remaining claim (negligence)
on December 15, 2014. Plaintiffs have appealed the rulings.

On April
29, 2014, Foster Poultry Farms sued Orkin, LLC and Orkin Services of California, Inc., for breach of contract, breach of covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, and negligence.  The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California.  Foster Farms is seeking damages related to pest control services performed at its chicken processing
facility during a nine month period. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.

On December
2, 2014, Plaintiff Killian Pest Control sued Rollins, Inc., its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense, and alleged that HomeTeam’s
exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, and California’s Cartwright
Act and Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the Sherman
and Cartwright Acts, and the Business and Professions Code; a permanent injunction against continuing alleged violations; and
monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. The Company cannot
currently estimate the reasonably possible loss, if any, because the lawsuit is at an early stage and involves unresolved issues
of law and fact. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.


On December
2, 2014, Plaintiff Jose Luis Garnica, on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated customers, sued Rollins, Inc., its
subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense, and alleged that HomeTeam’s exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system
violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act. The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the
Sherman Act; a permanent injunction against continuing violations; and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United
States District Court, Northern District of California. The Company cannot currently estimate the reasonably possible loss, if
any, because the lawsuit is at an early stage and involves unresolved issues of law and fact. The Company intends to defend this
matter vigorously.

Management
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual quarter or year.

EMPLOYEE
                                         BENEFIT PLANS

Defined
Benefit Pension Plans

Rollins,
Inc. Retirement Income Plan

The
Company maintains several noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”) covering employees
meeting certain age and service requirements. The Plans provides benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five
years during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated
Social Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plans with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company
made contributions of $5.3 million, $5.0 million and $5.2 million to the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013
and 2012 respectively.

In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan, although
the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005.  In 2012 and again in 2014, the Plan
was amended to allow certain vested participants the ability to elect for a limited time the commencement of their benefit
in the form of a single-sum payment, not to exceed $22,000 in 2014 or $13,500 in 2012, or an annuity starting date of December
1, 2014 for the 2014 amendment, or an annuity starting date of December 1, 2012 for the 2012 amendment.  In total $6.3 million
and $4.7 million was paid by the Plan during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012, respectively, under this program. 
The Plan did not offer any options for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The
Company terminated the Waltham Services, LLC Salaried Pension Plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase
or lump sum in December 2012.  The total payout by the plan was either in the form of lump sum payments (including rollovers)
or annuities.  Active employees were eligible to roll their balances into the Rollins 401(k) Savings Plan. The
Annuities were purchased through an unaffiliated insurance company.  The total amount disbursed to terminate the plan totaled
$4.0 million.

The
Company also includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan in the Company’s financial statements. The Company
accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation- Retirement Benefits”,
and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates
the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate,
and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.


In
June 2005, the Company froze the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit pension plan. The Company currently uses December 31 as the
measurement date for its defined benefit post-retirement plans. The funded status of the Plans and the net amount recognized in
the statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans were $221.7 million and $185.9 million at December 31, 2014
and 2013, respectively. Accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the same for the Plans.
Pre-tax increases in the pension liability which were (charged, net of tax) credited to other comprehensive income/(loss) were
$(41.7) million, $45.7 million, and $(15.4) million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

The
return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments
held in the plan. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns
on the plan investments.

The
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. 
In estimating this rate, for fiscal year’s 2014, 2013, and 2012 the Company utilized a yield curve analysis.

For
each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of
return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The
investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans utilize a number
of investment approaches, including individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities
are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. The Company and management are considering making contributions
to the pension plans of approximately $3.3 million during fiscal 2015.

Some
of our assets, primarily our private equity

and

real estate,
do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying
investments.  For the December 31, 2014 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. 
For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager statements combined with

discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.

Additionally,
these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have
a readily determinable fair value.  In accordance with ASU No. 2011-12 “Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate
Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated
by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may
prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these
risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included
in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.


Fair
Value Measurements

The
Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 70 percent of investments for long-term growth
and 30 percent for near-term benefit payments, with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. 
Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies

domiciled
domestically and

internationally.  Fixed-income securities include corporate bonds, mortgage-backed
securities,

sovereign bonds

,

and U.S. Treasuries. 
Other types of investments include real estate

funds and private equity funds that follow
several different investment strategies. For each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical
– maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of
providing pension benefits.  The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced
as required.  The plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including

but not
limited to

individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying
securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation.

Some
of our assets, primarily our private equity, real estate and hedge funds, do not have readily determinable market values given
the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. For the December 31, 2014 plan
asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily determinable values, estimates
were derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.

The
following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2014. The fair value hierarchy
has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. See note 7 for a brief description of the
three levels under the fair value hierarchy.

Defined
Contribution 401(k) Savings Plan

The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) Savings Plan that is available to a majority of the Company’s
full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following completion of three months of service. The Plan is available
to non full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one year of service upon completion of 1,000 hours in
that year.  The Plan provides for a matching contribution of fifty cents ($.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant’s
contributions to the Plan that do not exceed 6 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime
and bonuses). The charge to expense for the Company match was approximately $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and
$8.2 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. At December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012
approximately, 29.3%, 34.9%, and 32.5%, respectively of the plan assets consisted of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total administrative
fees paid by the Company for the Plan were approximately $51 thousand in 2014, $54 thousand in 2013 and $53 thousand in 2012.

Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan

The
Deferred Compensation Plan provides that participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual bonus
with respect to any given plan year, subject to a $2 thousand per plan year minimum. The Company may make discretionary contributions
to participant accounts. The Company credited accounts of participants of long service to the Company with certain discretionary
amounts (“Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions”) in lieu of benefits that previously accrued under the Company’s
Retirement Income Plan up to a maximum of $245 thousand. The Company made Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions under
the Deferred Compensation Plan for five years. The first contribution was made in January 2007 for those participants who were
employed for all of the 2006 plan year. Only employees with five full years of vested service on June 30, 2005 qualified for Pension
Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, salary and bonus deferrals and Pension Plan Benefit
Restoration Contributions are fully vested. Any discretionary contributions are subject to vesting in accordance with the matching
contribution vesting schedule set forth in the Rollins 401(k) Savings Plan in which a participant participates. The Company made
its last contributions associated with this plan during the first quarter of 2011.


Accounts
will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain “Measurement
Funds.” Account values are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and Company credits had been converted into shares or
other ownership units of selected Measurement Funds by purchasing (or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current
purchase price of the relevant Measurement Fund at the time of the participant’s selection. Deferred Compensation Plan benefits
are unsecured general obligations of the Company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with the Company’s
other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company has established a “rabbi trust,” which it uses to voluntarily
set aside amounts to indirectly fund any obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the extent that the Company’s
obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan exceed assets available under the trust, the Company would be required to seek
additional funding sources to fund its liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Generally,
the Deferred Compensation Plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant’s
death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment (a “Termination Event”). However, for any deferrals
of salary and bonus (but not Company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is
prior to a Termination Event. Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions
under the Deferred Compensation Plan in installments or lump-sum payments.

At
December 31, 2014 the Deferred Compensation Plan had 70 life insurance policies with a net face value of $42.4 million. The cash
surrender value of these life insurance policies were worth $12.7 million and $11.5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The
estimated life insurance premium payments over the next five years are as follows:

STOCK-BASED
                                         COMPENSATION

Stock
Compensation Plans

Stock
options and time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company’s
Employee Stock Incentive Plan.

Stock
Options

The
Company’s stock options generally vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date. For the year
ended December 31, 2014, the Company did not issue any shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees. The
Company issued 1 thousand shares in 2013.

In
order to estimate the fair value of stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed
for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time.


Option
activity under the Company’s stock option plan as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and changes during the year ended December
31, 2014 were as follows:

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s
closing stock price on the last trading day of the year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options)
that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that day. The amount of
aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock.

The
aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was zero

,
less than $0.1 million, and, $0.5 million, respectively. Exercise of options during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and
2012 resulted in cash receipts of zero, less than $10 thousand, and less than $1 thousand, respectively.

Time
Lapse Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain
stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting
with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends
declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that
shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

The
Company issued time lapse restricted shares of 0.4 million, 0.5 million, and 0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014,
2013, and 2012, respectively.

The
Company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2014, approximately 5.7 million shares
of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718, “

Compensation
– Stock Compensation,”

the Company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight line basis over the service
periods of each award. The Company estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.
