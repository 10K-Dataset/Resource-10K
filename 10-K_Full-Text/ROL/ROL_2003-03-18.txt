                                     PART I
Item 1. Business.

General

     Rollins,   Inc.  ("the  Company")  is  a  national   service  company  with
headquarters  located in Atlanta,  Georgia,  providing pest and termite  control
services to both residential and commercial customers in North America. Services
are performed through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the
customer.

     Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. ("Orkin"),  a wholly owned  subsidiary of
the  Company  founded in 1901,  is one of the world's  largest  pest and termite
control companies.  It provides  customized  services from over 400 locations to
approximately  1.6  million  customers.  Orkin  serves  customers  in the United
States,  Canada and  Mexico,  providing  essential  pest  control  services  and
protection against termite damage,  rodents and insects to homes and businesses,
including hotels,  food service  establishments,  dairy farms and transportation
companies.   Orkin  operates  under  the  Orkin(R)  and  PCO  Services,  Inc.(R)
trademarks  and the AcuridSM  service mark.  The Orkin(R) brand name makes Orkin
the most recognized  pest and termite  company in the country.  The PCO Services
brand name provides  similar  brand  recognition  in Canada.  The Company is the
largest pest control provider in Canada.

     The Company has only one reportable  segment,  its pest and termite control
business.  Revenue,  operating profit and identifiable  assets for this segment,
which includes the United States,  Canada and Mexico,  are included in Item 8 of
this document under financial  statements and supplementary data on pages 17 and
18. The  Company's  results of operations  and its  financial  condition are not
reliant upon any single  customer or a few  customers or the  Company's  foreign
operations.

     A bimonthly  pest control  service  initiative  was  implemented in 1999 to
better service our residential customers,  and has grown to represent just under
50% of our residential  customer base at the end of 2002. This program  provides
greater  convenience  to our  customers  and  enables  the  Company  to  achieve
technician productivity  improvements and other service efficiencies,  including
lower fleet costs. In addition, AcuridSM commercial pest elimination service was
introduced  company-wide in 2001. This premium service  includes insect control,
fly control, rodent control and odor control for commercial customers and is now
available through any Orkin branch.

     The dollar amount of service  contracts and backlog orders as of the end of
the Company's 2002 and 2001 calendar years was  approximately  $28.4 million and
$16.2 million,  respectively.  Backlog  services and orders are usually provided
within the month  following the month of receipt,  except in the area of prepaid
pest control and bait  monitoring  services,  which are usually  provided within
twelve  months of receipt.  The Company does not have a material  portion of its
business  that may be subject to  renegotiation  of  profits or  termination  of
contracts at the election of a governmental entity.

     The  Rollins   Customer   Care  Center   achieved   its  ISO  9002  quality
certification in 2001. It is joined by forty-seven dedicated commercial branches
that have also completed the ISO 9002 quality certification process.

     The Company  continues  to expand its growth  through  the Orkin  franchise
program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently
not  economically  feasible to locate a  conventional  Orkin branch.  There is a
built-in  exit  strategy at the end of the  franchise  term that  motivates  the
franchisee  to sell the business to Orkin.  There were 36 Company  franchises at
the end of 2002 compared to 30 at the end of 2001.

Seasonality

     The  business  of the Company is  affected  by the  seasonal  nature of the
Company's pest and termite control  services.  The increase in pest pressure and
activity as well as the  metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the
occurrence  of which is  determined  by the timing of the change in seasons) has
historically  resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company's
pest and termite  control  operations  during such  periods as  evidenced by the
following chart.

     --------------------------------------------------------------------------


Inventories

     The Company has  relationships  with multiple  vendors for pest and termite
control  treatment  products  and  maintains a  sufficient  level of  chemicals,
materials  and other  supplies to fulfill its immediate  servicing  needs and to
alleviate any potential  short-term  shortage in availability  from its national
network of suppliers.

Competition

     The Company believes that Orkin competes  favorably with competitors as one
of the world's largest pest and termite control companies.  The Company competes
with a number of pest and  termite  control  companies  including  Terminix  and
Ecolab.

     The principal  methods of  competition  in the  Company's  pest and termite
control business are quality of service and guarantees, including the money-back
guarantee on pest and termite  control,  and the termite  retreatment and damage
repair guarantee to qualified homeowners.

Research and Development

     Expenditures  by  the  Company  on  research  activities  relating  to  the
development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and
improved service methods and products are researched,  developed and produced by
unaffiliated  universities  and companies.  Also, a portion of these methods and
products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company. Some of the
more recent  studies that have been  conducted on behalf of the Company  include
one on fly  pathogens  by the  University  of  Florida  and an  integrated  pest
management   study  currently  being  performed  by  the  Virginia   Polytechnic
Institute.  Additional research at the University of Florida involves the impact
of soil type and soil compaction on termites tunneling behavior. Also, Texas A&M
has performed  studies on both termites and fire ants, using biological  control
agents for  population  reduction and  predicting  the time termites  swarm each
year.

Governmental Regulation

     State and local governmental licenses and permits are required in order for
the  Company  to  conduct  its pest and  termite  control  services  in  certain
localities.  In view  of the  widespread  operations  of the  Company's  service
operations, the failure of any local governments to license a facility would not
have a  material  adverse  effect on the  results  of  operations  or  financial
position of the Company.

     Other than the impact on the Company of governmental  regulation of the use
of  pesticides,  the  Company is not  materially  affected  by  compliance  with
federal,  state  and  local  provisions,  that  have  been  enacted  or  adopted
regulating  the  discharge  of  materials  into the  environment,  or  otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment.

Employees

     The number of persons  employed by the Company as of February  24, 2003 was
approximately 7,600.

Recent Developments

     The Board of  Directors,  at their  quarterly  meeting on January 28, 2003,
authorized a three-for-two  stock split by the issuance on March 10, 2003 of one
additional  common  share for each two common  shares held of record on February
10, 2003.  Accordingly,  the par value for additional shares issued was adjusted
to common  stock,  and  fractional  shares  resulting  from the stock split were
settled in cash.  All share and per share data  appearing  throughout  this Form
10-K have been retroactively adjusted for this stock split.

Item 2. Properties.

     The Company's  administrative  headquarters and central warehouse,  both of
which are  owned by the  Company,  are  located  at 2170  Piedmont  Road,  N.E.,
Atlanta,  Georgia  30324.  The Company  owns or leases  several  hundred  branch
offices and  operating  facilities  used in its  business as well as the Rollins
Training  Center  located  in  Atlanta,  Georgia.  None of the  branch  offices,
individually considered,  represents a materially important physical property of
the Company.  The  facilities  are suitable and adequate to meet the current and
reasonably anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

     Orkin,  one of the Company's  subsidiaries,  is a named  defendant in Helen
Cutler and Mary Lewin v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al. pending in the
District Court of Houston County, Alabama. The plaintiffs in the above mentioned
case filed suit in March of 1996 and are seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief  for  alleged  breach  of  contract  arising  out of  alleged  missed  or
inadequate reinspections. The attorneys for the plaintiffs contend that the case
is suitable for a class action and the court has ruled that the plaintiffs would
be  permitted  to pursue a class  action  lawsuit  against  Orkin.  The  Company
believes this case to be without  merit and intends to defend itself  vigorously
at  trial.  At  this  time,  the  final  outcome  of the  litigation  cannot  be
determined.  However,  it  is  the  opinion  of  Management  that  the  ultimate
resolution  of this  action  will  not have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     Orkin is also a named  defendant  in Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating
Company, Inc. et al. pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa,
Florida.  The  plaintiffs  filed suit in March of 1999 and are seeking  monetary
damages in excess of $15,000 for each named plaintiff and injunctive  relief for
alleged breach of contract,  fraud and various  violations of Florida state law.
The Court ruled in early April 2002, certifying the class action lawsuit against
Orkin. The Company has appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court
of Appeals.  Moreover,  the Company  believes  this case to be without merit and
intends to defend itself vigorously  through trial, if necessary.  At this time,
the final outcome of the  litigation  cannot be determined.  However,  it is the
opinion of Management that the ultimate  resolution of this action will not have
a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  financial  position,  results of
operations or liquidity.

     The Company is involved in certain  environmental matters primarily arising
in the normal course of business.  In the opinion of  Management,  the Company's
liability  under any of these matters would not materially  affect its financial
condition or results of operations.

     Additionally,  in the normal course of business, the Company is a defendant
in a number of  lawsuits,  which allege that  plaintiffs  have been damaged as a
result of the  rendering of services by Company  personnel  and  equipment.  The
Company is actively  contesting these actions.  It is the opinion of Management,
however,  that the  outcome of these  actions  will not have a material  adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General Operating Comments

     The Company's  continued emphasis on customer retention along with building
recurring revenues resulted in revenue growth of 2.4% in 2002 despite a sluggish
economy.  The  financial  results for the fourth  quarter 2002 and the year were
positively impacted by the continued benefit of our recent service  initiatives,
which included  every-other-month  residential  pest control  service,  AcuridSM
premium  commercial  pest  control  services,  and termite  directed  liquid and
baiting treatment.

     For the fourth  quarter of 2002, the Company had net income of $3.7 million
compared to net income of $1.6  million in the fourth  quarter of 2001.  For the
year ended  December  31,  2002,  the  Company  had net income of $27.1  million
compared to the prior year amount of $16.9  million,  which  represents  a 60.0%
increase.  The overall  improvement  for the year in profit margins is largely a
result of improved Cost of Services Provided and Sales, General & Administrative
a percentage of revenues, partially offset by higher depreciation.

Results of Operations - 2002 Versus 2001

     Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased to $665.4  million,
an  increase  of $15.5  million  or 2.4% from  last  year's  revenues  of $649.9
million.  The  Company's  foreign  operations  made  up  less  than  6.0% of the
Company's  total  revenues  in 2002 and 2001.  The revenue  increase  was mainly
attributable  to a modest  increase in revenues from pest control  services,  as
termite  revenues  were flat with the prior  year.  The  growth in pest  control
revenues  reflects the  beneficial  impact of better  customer  retention  and a
successful residential summer sales program,  factors that combined to produce a
net gain in the customer base as well as higher average selling  prices.  Within
the


U.S., the Company had an improvement in customer retention, a modest increase in
new sales units and an overall improvement in average selling prices,  resulting
in a  higher  ending  customer  base at the end of the  year.  Every-other-month
service,  our primary  residential pest control service  offering,  continues to
grow in  importance,  comprising  almost  50% of our  residential  pest  control
customer base at year end. Our commercial  revenues grew,  mainly as a result of
better pricing on new sales, a successful  price increase  campaign for existing
customers in 2002, and the  introduction of new products and services during the
year.  Although  termite revenues were flat in 2002 as a result of a decrease in
sales to new  customers,  the Company  experienced  an  improvement in recurring
revenues  mainly from  enhanced  renewal  retention  and higher bait  monitoring
services.  Despite the decrease in termite sales dollars, the Company managed to
achieve a slight improvement in average selling prices.

     Orkin's  directed  liquid  termite  baiting  program  generates   recurring
monitoring  revenues  that are  deferred to the balance  sheet each month in the
form of unearned  revenue.  This is then being recognized in future periods when
the service is rendered.

     Cost of Services  Provided for the year ended  December 31, 2002  decreased
$284,000 or 0.1% and  margins  improved  by 1.4  points,  representing  54.3% of
revenues in 2002  compared  to 55.7% of revenues in the prior year.  Improvement
for the year ended  December 31, 2002 can be mainly  attributed to the Company's
recent service initiatives that have increased productivity,  reduced headcount,
and  created  other  efficiencies  and better  asset  utilization.  The  Company
achieved reductions in service salaries,  personnel related expenses,  materials
and supplies,  travel and fleet expense, which were partially offset by slightly
higher  insurance  and claims  charges.  Pest  control  and  termite  technician
productivity  improved as did  employee  retention.  The Company  believes  that
better  employee  retention  has a direct impact on customer  retention.  Better
fleet  management  led to a decrease  in the average  number of vehicles  and an
improvement in revenues per vehicle.

     Sales,  General and  Administrative  for the year ended  December  31, 2002
decreased  $2.0  million or 0.8%,  and  improved  by 1.2 margin  points in 2002,
averaging  35.8%  of  total  revenues  compared  to 37.0%  for the  prior  year.
Improvement  for the year was mainly  attributed  to reduced  personnel  related
expenses, fleet expense, telephone expense, travel expense, bad debt expense and
sales  promotions  partially offset by higher summer selling program expense and
advertising expense.

     Depreciation and Amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002
were approximately $1.3 million or 6.6% higher than the prior year. The increase
was primarily due to the  depreciation  associated with FOCUS, the Company's new
proprietary  branch  computer  system.  The rollout of FOCUS to the branches was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2001. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No.
142, the  amortization of goodwill has been  discontinued as of January 1, 2002,
causing a  decrease  in  goodwill  amortization  expense of  approximately  $2.2
million partially offset by an increase in amortization  expense of $2.0 million
due to a change in the expected life of customer contracts.

     Net income for the year ended  December  31, 2002  includes  the effects of
adopting  SFAS No. 142,  which did not have a material  impact to the  Company's
overall results of operations.  In addition, if SFAS No. 142 had been adopted in
the year ended December 31, 2001, it would not have had a material impact to net
income previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2001.

     The  Company's  net tax  provision  of $16.6  million  for the  year  ended
December 31, 2002 reflects  increased  taxable  income over the prior year.  The
effective tax rate of 38% was consistent between periods presented.

     The decline in the Accrual for Termite  Contracts  of $4.4  million or 8.7%
reflects  improvement in the experience  rate, as well as the payment of several
large termite claims and the cost of remediation.  Accrued  Insurance  decreased
$0.7  million or 1.6% during the year as a result of improved  experience  rate,
attributable  to the Company's  proactive  management of issues  associated with
self insured risks.

Results of Operations - 2001 Versus 2000

     The 0.5%  increase in  revenues  for the year ended  December  31, 2001 was
primarily due to increased  recurring revenues in both pest and termite control.
Pest  control  benefited  from  improvement  in customer  retention  and a solid
increase in commercial  revenues.  The increased recurring revenues from termite
control can be mainly attributed to the impact of the termite baiting program.


     Orkin's  directed  liquid  termite  baiting  program  generates   recurring
monitoring  revenues  that are  deferred to the balance  sheet each month in the
form of unearned  revenue.  This is then being recognized in future periods when
the service is rendered.

     Over the past  couple of years,  the Company  has  successfully  integrated
several pest control companies acquired in the United States and Canada. Cost of
Services  Provided  decreased  $7.0  million  compared to 2000,  and improved to
represent 55.7% of revenues  compared to 57.0% in 2000. This margin  improvement
was primarily  attributable  to  productivity  improvements  and other increased
efficiencies,  including a reduced  workforce  in  service,  and  reductions  in
personnel  related  expenses and fleet expense that were partially  offset by an
increase  in  insurance   expense.   Depreciation  and  Amortization   increased
approximately   $1.9  million  or  10.2%  over  2000,   due   primarily  to  the
implementation  of our new  proprietary  branch computer  system,  FOCUS, in the
fourth quarter of 2001.

     Sales,  General and  Administrative  decreased  $4.0 million over 2000, and
improved  to  represent  37.0% of  revenues  compared  to  37.8%  in 2000.  This
improvement  as a  percentage  of  revenues  resulted  primarily  from  improved
efficiencies and a reduced workforce in sales, decreased other personnel related
costs, and decreased bad debt expense.

     Net interest  income  declined  $252,000 or 56.0% in 2001  primarily due to
lower interest rates on invested cash balances and higher  interest  expense for
notes payable associated with acquisitions.

     The Company's tax provision of $10.4 million as compared to $5.9 million in
2000, reflects increased income in 2001.

     The decline in the Accrual for Termite  Contracts  of $6.8 million or 11.8%
reflects  improvement in the experience  rate, as well as the payment of termite
claims and the cost of remediation.  Accrued Insurance decreased $6.3 million or
12.9% during the year as a result of improved  experience rate,  attributable to
the Company's proactive management of issues associated with self insured risks.

Related Party Transactions

     At the  Company's  October  22,  2002  Board  of  Directors'  meeting,  the
independent  directors  of the  Board  of  Directors'  and the  Audit  Committee
approved  three  related  party  transactions.   The  Audit  Committee  and  the
independent  directors were furnished with full disclosure of the  transactions,
including  independent  appraisals,  and  determined  that  the  terms  of  each
transaction were reasonable and fair to the Company.  The first approval was the
purchase of the  Rollins  Training  Center on October 31, 2002 for $3.1  million
from RTC, LLC, a company controlled by R. Randall Rollins, Chairman of the Board
of Rollins,  Inc. The second  approval  was the  purchase of hand-held  computer
software  development  known as  PowerTrak  Version 1.0 from RRR  Associates,  a
company  controlled  by R.  Randall  Rollins.  The  purchase was made during the
fourth quarter at an approved purchase price of $250,000. The third approval was
a lease agreement  effective July 1, 2002 that expires June 30, 2007 for company
real  estate in  Okeechobee  County,  Florida to be leased to Rollins  Ranch,  a
division of LOR,  Inc., a company  controlled by R. Randall  Rollins and Gary W.
Rollins,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  President and Chief  Operating  Officer of
Rollins,  Inc. The annual lease rate on this real estate is $131,939.  It is the
opinion of Management that these related party  transactions were reasonable and
fair to the  Company  and will  not  have a  material  effect  on the  Company's
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     At the  Company's  January  28,  2003  Board  of  Directors'  meeting,  the
independent  directors  of the  Board  of  Directors'  and the  Audit  Committee
approved  four  related  party   transactions.   The  Audit  Committee  and  the
independent  directors were furnished with full disclosure of the  transactions,
including  independent  appraisals,  and  determined  that  the  terms  of  each
transaction were reasonable and fair to the Company and will not have a material
effect on the Company's financial position,  results of operations or liquidity.
The first  approval  was the  ratification  of the current  arrangement  between
Rollins, Inc. and LOR, Inc., a company controlled by R. Randall Rollins and Gary
W.   Rollins,   related  to  sharing  the   aviation   hangar   located  at  the
Dekalb-Peachtree  Airport as well the usage of the Jetstar II, owned by Rollins,
Inc., and Gulfstream III, owned by LOR, Inc. LOR, Inc. leases half of the hangar
from  Rollins,  Inc.  for a total  annual  lease  amount of $13,655.  This lease
expires on January 24, 2008. The hangar currently houses three airplanes, two of
which are not owned by  Rollins,  Inc.  and reside on the  portion of the hangar
leased by LOR,  Inc.  All other  expenses  related to the hangar are also shared
equally  by  Rollins,   Inc.  and  LOR,  Inc.   Total  expenses  for  2002  were
approximately  $114,000,  which  includes  rental,  utilities,  maintenance  and
repairs,  depreciation,  property tax and miscellaneous  expense. The Jetstar II
and Gulfstream  III are used by both Rollins,  Inc. and LOR, Inc. and are billed
on a monthly basis. The Gulfstream III is charged at a rate of $12,750 per month
while the  Jetstar II is charged  at a rate of $5,250  per month.  All  expenses
related to each respective  aircraft are paid for by the owner of each aircraft,
except for fuel.  Fuel is paid for by Rollins,  Inc.  and billed  monthly to the
company using the aircraft. Additionally, Mr. R. Randall Rollins and Mr. Gary W.
Rollins  use the Jetstar II for  personal  use and are billed for its use at the
rate of


$1,000 per hour,  which  approximates  the fuel cost. The total hourly usage for
2002 was  approximately  6 hours or $6,000.  The  Company on  occasion  uses the
Gulfstream  III and is also  billed  for its use at a rate of  $1,000  per hour,
which  approximates  the fuel cost. The second approval was the  ratification of
the  arrangement  concerning the rental of office space to LOR, Inc.  located at
2170 Piedmont Road N.E.,  Atlanta,  Georgia 30324.  The property located at 2170
Piedmont Road is owned by Rollins Continental, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of
Rollins,  Inc. Currently LOR, Inc. occupies  approximately  3,580 square feet of
office space in the building  located at 2170 Piedmont  Road.  The annual rental
rate is $39,029.  The third  approval was the  ratification  of the  arrangement
concerning  the rental of office  space to LOR,  Inc.  located at 710  Lakeshore
Circle, Atlanta,  Georgia 30324. The property located at 710 Lakeshore Circle is
also  owned  by  Rollins   Continental,   Inc.   Currently  LOR,  Inc.  occupies
approximately  3,344 square feet of office space in the building  located at 710
Lakeshore Circle. The annual rental rate is $40,800. The fourth approval was the
ratification of the current  arrangement  related to the payment of fees for the
services of a  programmer/analyst  that was employed by LOR, Inc. but has become
employed by Rollins,  Inc. in the first quarter of 2003. The  programmer/analyst
is being used to further  develop the PowerTrak  Version 1.0 hand-held  computer
software  purchased  in the fourth  quarter of 2002 (as  discussed  in the above
paragraph). The hourly wage paid to LOR, Inc. was $32 per hour, which equated to
$66,560 per year, including overhead. It is the opinion of Management that these
related party  transactions were reasonable and fair to the Company and will not
have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company's  financial  position,  results  of
operations or liquidity.

     Employees  of Rollins,  Inc.  confer with  employees  of LOR,  Inc. and RRR
Associates and vice versa. No fees are charged for these services because in the
opinion of Management the activity is mutually beneficial and offsetting.

Critical Accounting Policies

     We view  critical  accounting  policies to be those  policies that are very
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations,
and that require Management's most difficult,  complex or subjective  judgments.
The circumstances  that make these judgments  difficult or complex relate to the
need for  Management  to make  estimates  about the effect of  matters  that are
inherently  uncertain.  We believe  our  critical  accounting  policies to be as
follows:

     Accrual  for  Termite  Contracts  - The  Company  maintains  an accrual for
     termite  contracts  representing  the  estimated  costs of  reapplications,
     repair claims and associated labor, chemicals,  and other costs relative to
     termite  control  services  performed  prior to the balance sheet date. The
     Company  contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to
     provide the Company a range of estimated  liability  based upon  historical
     claims  information.  The  actuarial  study  is a  major  consideration  in
     determining  the  accrual  balance  along with  Management's  knowledge  of
     changes in business practices, contract changes, ongoing claims and termite
     remediation  trends. The reserve is established based on all these factors.
     Management  makes  judgments   utilizing  these  operational   factors  but
     recognizes  that they are  inherently  subjective  due to the difficulty in
     predicting  settlements  and awards.  Other  factors that may impact future
     cost include  chemical life expectancy and governmental  regulation.  It is
     significant  that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years
     due to changes in the  Company's  business  practices.  However,  it is not
     possible to accurately predict future significant claims.  Positive changes
     to our business  practices  include  revisions made to our contracts,  more
     effective treatment methods that include a directed-liquid baiting program,
     more effective termiticides, and expanded training methods and techniques.

     Accrued  Insurance  - The Company  self-insures,  up to  specified  limits,
     certain  risks  related to general  liability,  workers'  compensation  and
     vehicle liability.  The estimated costs of existing and future claims under
     the  self-insurance  program are accrued  based upon  historical  trends as
     incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement
     of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently
     revised  based  on  developments  relating  to  such  claims.  The  Company
     contracts an independent  third party actuary on an annual basis to provide
     the Company a range of estimated  liability  based upon  historical  claims
     information.  The  actuarial  study is a major  consideration,  along  with
     Management's  knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims
     compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these
     factors.  Management's  judgment is inherently  subjective  and a number of
     factors are  outside  Management's  knowledge  and  control.  Additionally,
     historical  information  is not  always an  accurate  indication  of future
     events.  It should be noted that the  number of claims has been  decreasing
     due to the  Company's  proactive  risk  management  to develop and maintain
     ongoing programs.  However, it is not possible to accurately predict future
     significant  claims.  Initiatives  that  have  been  implemented,   include
     pre-employment  and an annual  Motor  Vehicle  report  required  on all its
     drivers,  utilization  of a Global  Positioning  System that has been fully
     deployed to our Company vehicles,  post-offer  physicals for new employees,
     and  pre-hire,  random and  post-accident  drug  testing.  The  Company has
     improved  the time  required  to report a claim by  utilizing a "Red Alert"
     program that provides serious accident  assessment  twenty four hours a day
     and seven days a week and has  instituted  a  modified  duty  program  that
     enables employees to go back to work on a limited-duty basis.


     Revenue  Recognition  - The  Company's  revenue  recognition  policies  are
     designed to  recognize  revenues at the time  services are  performed.  For
     certain revenue types,  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of
     cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates
     are  utilized.   Residential  and  commercial  pest  control  services  are
     primarily recurring in nature,  while certain types of commercial customers
     may receive  multiple  treatments  within a given month.  In general,  pest
     control  customers  sign an initial one year  contract,  and  revenues  are
     recognized at the time services are performed.  For pest control customers,
     the Company  offers a discount  for those  customers  who prepay for a full
     year of services.  The Company defers recognition of these advance payments
     and  recognizes  the  revenue as the  services  are  rendered.  The Company
     classifies the discounts  related to the advance payments as a reduction in
     revenues. Termite baiting revenues are recognized when the initial services
     are  performed at the  inception of a new  contract,  although a portion of
     every termite baiting sale is deferred.  The amount deferred is an estimate
     of the value of  monitoring  services  to be  rendered  after  the  initial
     service.   The  amount   deferred  is  then   recognized  as  income  on  a
     straight-line  basis over the  remaining  contract  term,  which results in
     recognition  of  revenue  in a  pattern  that  approximates  the  timing of
     performing monitoring visits.  Baiting renewals are deferred and recognized
     over the annual contract period on a straight-line  basis that approximates
     the  timing of  performing  the  required  monitoring  visits.  Traditional
     termite  treatments  are  recognized  as revenue at the time  services  are
     performed. Traditional termite contract renewals are recognized as revenues
     at the  renewal  date in order to match the  revenue  with the  approximate
     timing of the corresponding service provided.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company  believes  its current  cash  balances,  future cash flows from
operating  activities and available  borrowings  under its $40.0 million line of
credit will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and
fund  expansion  of the  business  for the  foreseeable  future.  The  Company's
operations generated cash of $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
compared with cash provided by operating activities of $29.6 million in 2001 and
$11.4  million in 2000.  The 2002 increase  resulted  primarily  from  favorable
changes  in  working  capital  related  primarily  to  higher  net  income  from
operations,  the timing of advanced  payments from  customers  which produced an
increase in unearned revenue, and the Company's ability to reduce its investment
in accounts  receivable and inventories  despite higher revenues.  A customer of
the Company,  Kmart,  declared  bankruptcy in January 2002, which did not have a
material impact on the Company's results of operations or its liquidity.

     The Company invested  approximately  $10.4 million in capital  expenditures
during the year ended  December  31,  2002.  Capital  expenditures  for the year
consisted  primarily  of the  purchase of the Rollins  Training  Center for $3.1
million, as well as equipment  replacements and upgrades and improvements to the
Company's management  information systems. The Company expects to invest between
$8.5 million and $10.5 million in 2003 in capital expenditures. During the year,
the Company made several  acquisitions  totaling  $1.8 million  compared to $0.7
million during 2001. The Company  currently does not have plans to  aggressively
seek new  acquisitions but will give  consideration to any unusually  attractive
acquisition  opportunities  presented.  A total of $6.0 million was paid in cash
dividends ($0.033 a quarter) during the year and approximately  $6.2 million was
paid  for  repurchases  of  496,200  shares  of  the  Company's   Common  Stock.
Approximately 108,000 of these repurchased shares were used for the 401(k) match
in February 2003. At the January 28, 2003 Board of Directors'  Meeting the Board
approved  a 50%  increase  in the  dividend,  from  $0.033 to $0.05 on the split
number of shares, as well as a three-for-two stock split to holders of record on
February  10,  2003  payable   March  10,   2003.   The  capital   expenditures,
acquisitions,  stock repurchases and cash dividends were funded entirely through
existing cash balances and operating  activities.  The Company maintains a $40.0
million  credit  facility with a commercial  bank,  of which no borrowings  were
outstanding as of December 31, 2002 or February 24, 2003.  However,  the Company
does maintain approximately $25.0 million in Letters of Credit.

     Orkin, one of the Company's subsidiaries, is aggressively defending a class
action lawsuit filed in Hillsborough  County,  Tampa,  Florida.  In early April,
2002, the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County certified the class action status
of Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc. et al. Orkin is also a
defendant in Helen Cutler and Mary Lewin v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et
al pending  in the  District  Court of  Houston  County,  Alabama.  For  further
discussion, see Note 7 to the accompanying financial statements.

     In  late  April  of  2002,  the  Company   initiated  a  restructuring  and
re-engineering of the Home Office at its corporate  headquarters in Atlanta.  As
part of this  reorganization,  positions were eliminated and a new  organization
was implemented to provide more effective processes and support to the field. In
2002, the Company incurred  $824,000 in costs related to the  restructuring  and
does not  anticipate  additional  costs in 2003. It is the opinion of Management
that the  reorganization  will  not  have a  material  effect  on the  Company's
financial position,  results of operations or liquidity in the near term, though
ultimately improving the profitability and cash flows of the Company.


     The Company  made  contributions  of $20.0  million to the defined  benefit
retirement  plan  (the  "Plan")  during  2002  as a  result  of the  Plan  being
underfunded.  The Company believes that it will make contributions in the amount
of approximately  $5.0 to $10.0 million in 2003. It is the opinion of Management
that  additional  Plan  contributions  will not have a  material  effect  on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     At  December  31,  2002,   the  Company  had  the   following   contractual
commitments:

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 143,  Accounting  for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after June
15,  2002.  The  Statement  requires  legal  obligations   associated  with  the
retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time
that the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that
cost should be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated
to expense over the useful life of the asset.  The Company will adopt  Statement
143 on January 1, 2003,  and, based on current  circumstances,  does not believe
that the impact of adoption of Statement 143 will have a material  impact on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

     In April  2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No.  145,  Rescission  of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,  Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections, that rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from
Extinguishment of Debt, FASB Statement No. 64,  Extinguishments  of Debt Made to
Satisfy  Sinking-Fund  Requirements,  and FASB Statement No. 44,  Accounting for
Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers.  This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 4
and FASB Statement No. 13,  Accounting for Leases, to eliminate an inconsistency
between the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions.  This Statement
also  amends  other  existing  authoritative   pronouncements  to  make  various
technical  corrections,  clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under
changed  conditions.  The Company will adopt the  provisions  of  Statement  145
related to the rescission of Statement 4 on January 1, 2003. The Company adopted
the provisions of this  Statement  related to Statement 13, as well as all other
provisions of this Statement, which were effective May 15, 2002. The adoption of
these  provisions  did not have a  material  impact on the  Company's  financial
position,  results of operations  or liquidity  for the year ended  December 31,
2002.  Management  believes that the adoption of the provisions of Statement 145
related to the rescission of Statement 4 will not have a material  effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     In June 2002,  the FASB  issued  Statement  No. 146,  Accounting  for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which requires that a liability for
a cost  associated  with an exit or  disposal  activity be  recognized  when the
liability  is incurred  and  nullifies  EITF 94-3.  The  Company  plans to adopt
Statement 146 on January 1, 2003.  Management believes that the adoption of this
statement will not have a material effect on the Company's  financial  position,
results of operations or liquidity.

     In  December  2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No.  148,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation,  Transition  and  Disclosure.  Statement 148 provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation and requires expanded
disclosure  regarding  stock-based  compensation  in the "Summary of Significant
Accounting  Policies",  or its  equivalent,  in the  notes  to the  consolidated
financial statements about the method of accounting and the effect of the method
used on reported  results.  The  disclosure  provisions  of this  Statement  are
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December
15,  2002.  The Company  does not expect to  transition  to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based compensation.  Management believes that the
adoption  of  Statement  148 will not have a  material  effect on the  financial
position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.


     In November  2002, the FASB issued FASB  Interpretation  No. 45 ("FIN 45"),
Guarantor's  Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements  for Guarantees,  Including
Direct Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,  which requires expanded disclosure
for existing  guarantees and product  warranties for the year ended December 31,
2002 in addition to stipulating that at the inception of guarantees issued after
December 31, 2002, a company  needs to record the fair value of the guarantee as
a liability, with the offsetting entry being recorded based on the circumstances
in which the guarantee was issued.  FIN 45 further  states that the liability is
typically  reduced  over the term of the  guarantee.  The Company will apply the
initial  recognition and measurement  provisions on a prospective  basis for all
guarantees  issued  after  December  31,  2002.  Adoption of FIN 45 will have no
impact on the Company's  historical  financial statements as existing guarantees
are not subject to the measurement provisions of FIN 45.

     In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 00-21, Revenue
Arrangements  with  Multiple  Deliverables,   which  is  effective  for  revenue
arrangements  entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. This
EITF addresses how to account for arrangements  that may involve the delivery or
performance of multiple  products,  services,  and/or rights to use assets.  The
Company is currently analyzing the impact of adopting this EITF.

Forward-Looking Statements

     This Annual Report contains  forward-looking  statements within the meaning
of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such  forward-looking
statements include statements  regarding the expected impact of potential future
pension  plan  contributions,   related  party  transactions,   the  outcome  of
litigation  arising in the  ordinary  course of business  and the outcome of the
Helen  Cutler  and Mary  Lewin  v.  Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc.  et al.
("Cutler") and the Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc. et al.
("Butland")  litigation  on  the  Company's  financial  condition,   results  of
operations  and  liquidity;  the  adequacy of the  Company's  resources  to fund
operations  and  obligations;  the  impact  of the  corporate  restructuring  on
liquidity and results of  operations;  and the Company's  projected 2003 capital
expenditures.  The actual  results of the Company could differ  materially  from
those  indicated by the  forward-looking  statements  because of various  risks,
timing and uncertainties  including,  without limitation,  the possibility of an
adverse ruling against the Company in the Cutler,  Butland or other  litigation;
general  economic  conditions;  market  risk;  changes in industry  practices or
technologies; the degree of success of the Company's termite process reforms and
pest control selling and treatment  methods;  the Company's  ability to identify
potential  acquisitions;  climate and weather  trends;  competitive  factors and
pricing   practices;   that  the  cost  reduction   benefits  of  the  corporate
restructuring  may not be as great as expected or eliminated  positions may have
to be reinstated in the future;  potential increases in labor costs; and changes
in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations.
All of the  foregoing  risks and  uncertainties  are beyond  the  ability of the
Company to control,  and in many cases the Company  cannot predict the risks and
uncertainties  that could  cause its actual  results to differ  materially  from
those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market Risk

     As of December 31, 2002,  the Company  maintained an  investment  portfolio
subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company has been affected
by the impact of lower  interest  rates on interest  income from its  short-term
investments.  The Company is also subject to interest rate risk exposure through
borrowings  on its $40.0  million  credit  facility.  Due to the absence of such
borrowings as of December 31, 2002 and as currently  anticipated  for 2003, this
risk is not  expected to have a material  effect upon the  Company's  results of
operations or financial  position going forward.  The Company is also exposed to
market  risks  arising  from  changes in foreign  exchange  rates.  The  Company
believes that this foreign  exchange  rate risk will not have a material  effect
upon the Company's results of operations or financial position going forward.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business  Description  - Rollins,  Inc.  ("the  Company") is a national  service
company  with  headquarters  located in  Atlanta,  Georgia,  providing  pest and
termite control services to both residential and commercial customers.

     Orkin Exterminating  Company, Inc. ("Orkin"),  a wholly owned subsidiary of
the  Company  founded in 1901,  is one of the world's  largest  pest and termite
control companies.  It provides  customized  services from over 400 locations to
approximately  1.6  million  customers.  Orkin  serves  customers  in the United
States,  Canada,  and Mexico,  providing  essential  pest  control  services and
protection against termite damage,  rodents and insects to homes and businesses,
including  hotels,  food service  establishments,  discount  and grocery  retail
stores,  dairy farms and  transportation  companies.  Orkin  operates  under the
Orkin(R) and PCO Services, Inc.(R) trademarks and the AcuridSM service mark.

     The Company has only one reportable  segment,  its pest and termite control
business.  The Company's  results of operations and its financial  condition are
not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company's foreign
operations.

Principles  of  Consolidation  - The  consolidated  financial  statements of the
Company  include  the  accounts  of  Rollins,  Inc.  and its  subsidiaries.  All
significant  intercompany  accounts and  transactions  have been  eliminated  in
consolidation.

Estimates Used in the  Preparation of  Consolidated  Financial  Statements - The
preparation  of  the  consolidated   financial  statements  in  conformity  with
accounting   principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the  accompanying  notes and financial  statements.  Such estimates  include the
amount of valuation  reserves for bad debt,  Accrued  Insurance  and Accrual for
Termite Contracts balances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenues - The Company's revenue recognition  policies are designed to recognize
revenues at the time services are performed.  For certain revenue types, because
of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing
services, certain accounting estimates are utilized.  Residential and commercial
pest control services are primarily recurring in nature,  while certain types of
commercial  customers may receive multiple  treatments  within a given month. In
general, pest control customers sign an initial one year contract,  and revenues
are recognized at the time services are performed.  For pest control  customers,
the Company offers a discount for those  customers who prepay for a full year of
services.   The  Company  defers  recognition  of  these  advance  payments  and
recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered.  The Company classifies the
discounts  related to the advance  payments as a reduction in revenues.  Termite
baiting  revenues are recognized when the initial  services are performed at the
inception of a new contract, although a portion of every termite baiting sale is
deferred. The amount deferred is an estimate of the value of monitoring services
to be rendered after the initial service. The amount deferred is then recognized
as income on a  straight-line  basis over the  remaining  contract  term,  which
results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that  approximates  the timing of
performing monitoring visits.  Baiting renewals are deferred and recognized over
the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing
of performing the required monitoring visits. Traditional termite treatments are
recognized as revenue at the time services are  performed.  Traditional  termite
contract  renewals  are  recognized  as revenues at the renewal date in order to
match the  revenue  with the  approximate  timing of the  corresponding  service
provided. Interest income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on
actual loan balances and stated interest rates.  Franchise fee income is treated
as unearned  revenue in the Statement of Financial  Position for the duration of
the initial contract period.  Royalty fees from Orkin franchises are accrued and
recognized as revenues on a monthly basis.

Cash and Short-Term  Investments - The Company  considers all investments with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Short-term investments
are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.

Materials  and  Supplies - Materials  and  supplies are recorded at the lower of
cost (first-in,  first-out basis) or market. The Company's centralized warehouse
is located in Atlanta, Georgia.



Equipment  and Property -  Depreciation  and  amortization,  which  includes the
amortization of assets recorded under capital leases,  are provided  principally
on a straight-line  basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Annual  provisions for  depreciation of $15.0 million in 2002, $13.6 million and
$11.4  million  for each of the  years  2001 and  2000,  respectively  have been
reflected in the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income in the line item  entitled
Depreciation  and  Amortization.  These annual  provisions for  depreciation are
computed using the following  asset lives:  buildings,  ten to forty years;  and
furniture,  fixtures, and operating equipment,  three to ten years. Expenditures
for additions,  major renewals and betterments are capitalized and  expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets retired
or  otherwise  disposed  of  and  the  related   accumulated   depreciation  and
amortization  are eliminated  from the accounts in the year of disposal with the
resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income.

Insurance - The Company  self-insures,  up to specified  limits,  certain  risks
related to general liability,  workers' compensation and vehicle liability.  The
estimated costs of existing and future claims under the  self-insurance  program
are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or
unreported  (although  actual  settlement  of the  claims  may not be made until
future periods) and may be subsequently  revised based on developments  relating
to such claims.  The Company  contracts an independent third party actuary on an
annual  basis to provide the Company a range of estimated  liability  based upon
historical  claims  information.  The actuarial study is a major  consideration,
along with  Management's  knowledge of changes in business practice and existing
claims  compared to current  balances.  The reserve is established  based on all
these factors.  Management's  judgment is inherently  subjective and a number of
factors are outside Management's knowledge and control. Additionally, historical
information is not always an accurate indication of future events.

Advertising  -  Advertising  expenses  are charged to income  during the year in
which they are incurred.  The total advertising costs were  approximately  $30.0
million, $30.2 million and $30.8 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Income  Taxes - The Company  provides  for income  taxes based on  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 109,  Accounting  for Income Taxes,
which  requires  recognition  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and assets for the
expected  future  tax  consequences  of events  that have been  included  in the
consolidated financial statements or tax returns.

Earnings  Per  Share - In  accordance  with  SFAS No.  128,  Earnings  Per Share
("EPS"),  the Company  presents basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed
on the basis of weighted-average shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS is computed on
the basis of  weighted-average  shares  outstanding  plus common  stock  options
outstanding  during the year, which, if exercised,  would have a dilutive effect
on EPS.  Basic and  diluted EPS are the same for all years  reported.  Basic and
diluted  EPS  have  been  restated  for  the   three-for-two   stock  split.   A
reconciliation of the number of weighted-average  shares used in computing basic
and diluted EPS is as follows:

Stock-Based  Compensation  - As  permitted  by  SFAS  No.  123,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation,  the Company accounts for employee stock compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.


Comprehensive Income -For the year ended December 31, 2000, comprehensive income
was not  materially  different  from net income and, as a result,  the impact of
SFAS  No.  130,  Reporting  Comprehensive  Income,  was not  reflected  in those
consolidated  financial  statements.  For the years  ended  2002 and  2001,  the
Company is reporting  comprehensive income due to additional minimum liabilities
recorded in association with the pension plan and foreign currency  translations
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.

New  Accounting  Standards - In June 2001,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board  ("FASB")  issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which is effective for fiscal years
beginning  after  June  15,  2002.  The  Statement  requires  legal  obligations
associated  with the  retirement of long-lived  assets to be recognized at their
fair  value  at the  time  that  the  obligations  are  incurred.  Upon  initial
recognition  of a  liability,  that cost  should be  capitalized  as part of the
related  long-lived  asset and  allocated to expense over the useful life of the
asset.  The Company will adopt  Statement 143 on January 1, 2003,  and, based on
current circumstances, does not believe that the impact of adoption of Statement
143 will have a material impact on the Company's  financial  position or results
of operations.

     In April  2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No.  145,  Rescission  of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,  Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections, that rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from
Extinguishment of Debt, FASB Statement No. 64,  Extinguishments  of Debt Made to
Satisfy  Sinking-Fund  Requirements,  and FASB Statement No. 44,  Accounting for
Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers.  This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 4
and FASB Statement No. 13,  Accounting for Leases, to eliminate an inconsistency
between the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions.  This Statement
also  amends  other  existing  authoritative   pronouncements  to  make  various
technical  corrections,  clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under
changed  conditions.  The Company will adopt the  provisions  of  Statement  145
related to the rescission of Statement 4 on January 1, 2003. The Company adopted
the provisions of this  Statement  related to Statement 13, as well as all other
provisions of this Statement, which were effective May 15, 2002. The adoption of
these  provisions  did not have a  material  impact on the  Company's  financial
position,  results of operations  or liquidity  for the year ended  December 31,
2002.  Management  believes that the adoption of the provisions of Statement 145
related to the rescission of Statement 4 will not have a material  effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     In June 2002,  the FASB  issued  Statement  No. 146,  Accounting  for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which requires that a liability for
a cost  associated  with an exit or  disposal  activity be  recognized  when the
liability  is incurred  and  nullifies  EITF 94-3.  The  Company  plans to adopt
Statement 146 on January 1, 2003.  Management believes that the adoption of this
statement will not have a material effect on the Company's  financial  position,
results of operations or liquidity.

     In  December  2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No.  148,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation,  Transition  and  Disclosure.  Statement 148 provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation and requires expanded
disclosure  regarding  stock-based  compensation  in the "Summary of Significant
Accounting  Policies",  or its  equivalent,  in the  notes  to the  consolidated
financial statements about the method of accounting and the effect of the method
used on reported  results.  The  disclosure  provisions  of this  Statement  are
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December
15,  2002.  The Company  does not expect to  transition  to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based compensation.  Management believes that the
adoption  of  Statement  148 will not have a  material  effect on the  financial
position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.

     In November  2002, the FASB issued FASB  Interpretation  No. 45 ("FIN 45"),
Guarantor's  Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements  for Guarantees,  Including
Direct Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,  which requires expanded disclosure
for existing  guarantees and product  warranties for the year ended December 31,
2002 in addition to stipulating that at the inception of guarantees issued after
December 31, 2002, a company  needs to record the fair value of the guarantee as
a liability, with the offsetting entry being recorded based on the circumstances
in which the guarantee was issued.  FIN 45 further  states that the liability is
typically  reduced  over the term of the  guarantee.  The Company will apply the
initial  recognition and measurement  provisions on a prospective  basis for all
guarantees  issued  after  December  31,  2002.  Adoption of FIN 45 will have no
impact on the Company's  historical  financial statements as existing guarantees
are not subject to the measurement provisions of FIN 45.

     In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 00-21, Revenue
Arrangements  with  Multiple  Deliverables,   which  is  effective  for  revenue
arrangements  entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. This
EITF addresses how to account for arrangements  that may involve the delivery or
performance of multiple  products,  services,  and/or rights to use assets.  The
Company is currently analyzing the impact of adopting this EITF.



Fair  Value of  Financial  Instruments  - The  Company's  financial  instruments
consist of cash and short-term investments, trade receivables,  accounts payable
and other  short-term  liabilities.  The  carrying  amounts  of these  financial
instruments approximate their fair values.

Reclassifications - Certain amounts for previous years have been reclassified to
conform with the 2002 consolidated financial statement presentation.

Three-for-Two  Stock Split - The Board of Directors,  at their quarterly meeting
on January 28, 2003,  authorized a three-for-two  stock split by the issuance on
March 10, 2003 of one additional common share for each two common shares held on
record at February 10, 2003.  Accordingly,  the par value for additional  shares
issued was adjusted to common stock,  and fractional  shares  resulting from the
stock split were settled in cash.  All share and per share data appearing in the
consolidated  financial  statements  and related  notes have been  retroactively
adjusted for this stock split.

2. TRADE RECEIVABLES
     Trade receivables, net, at December 31, 2002, totaling $47.7 million and at
December 31, 2001,  totaling  $48.5 million are net of  allowances  for doubtful
accounts  of $5.4  million and $7.0  million,  respectively.  Trade  receivables
include  installment  receivable  amounts,  which are due subsequent to one year
from the balance sheet dates.  These amounts were approximately $6.4 million and
$7.4 million at the end of 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  The carrying amount of
installment   receivables   approximates   fair  value  as  the  interest  rates
approximate  market rates. The Allowance For Doubtful Accounts is calculated and
recorded on a monthly basis,  and is based on the  application of percentages to
delinquency  aging totals for the various  categories of  receivables,  specific
consideration  and current  economic  conditions.  Bad debt write-offs  occur at
certain aging dates. At any given time, the Company may have immaterial  amounts
due from related  parties,  which are  invoiced and settled on a regular  basis.
Receivables  due from related  parties were $64,000 as of December 31, 2002,  as
compared to $53,000 as of December 31, 2001.

     Equipment and property are presented at cost less accumulated  depreciation
and are detailed as follows:

                                                       -------------------------
                                                           $38,880      $44,273
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
     Intangibles  consist primarily of goodwill and customer  contracts and also
includes  trademarks  and  non-compete  agreements,  all  related to  businesses
acquired.  Goodwill  represents  the excess of the purchase  price over the fair
value of net assets of businesses acquired.  The carrying amount of goodwill was
$72.4  million  as  of  December  31,  2002  and  2001.  Goodwill  arising  from
acquisitions  prior to  November  1970 has never been  amortized  for  financial
statement  purposes,  since,  in the  opinion of  Management,  there has been no
decrease  in the  value of the  acquired  businesses.  During  the  years  ended
December  31,  2000 and 2001,  the values  assigned  to all  intangible  assets,
including  goodwill for acquisitions  completed  subsequent to November 1970 and
prior to June  30,  2001,  were  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, not exceeding 40 years.

     On January 1, 2002, the Company  adopted FASB  Statement No. 142,  Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. As of January 1, 2002, amortization of goodwill and
trademarks  was  terminated,  and  instead  the assets are  subject to  periodic
testing for impairment.  The Company  completed an initial  impairment  analysis
upon  adoption of Statement  142 and a subsequent  analysis as of September  30,
2002.  Based upon the results of these analyses,  the Company has concluded that
no impairment of its goodwill or trademarks has occurred.



     Customer   contracts  and   non-compete   agreements  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis over the period of the agreements,  as  straight-line  best
approximates  the ratio that current  revenues  bear to the total of current and
anticipated revenues,  based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance
with  Statement 142, the expected  lives of customer  contracts and  non-compete
agreements were reviewed,  and it was determined that customer  contracts should
be amortized over a life of 8 to 12 1/2 years  dependent upon customer type. The
impact  of this  review  in 2002 was an  increase  in  amortization  expense  on
customer  contracts  of  $2.0  million.  The  carrying  amount  and  accumulated
amortization for customer contracts are as follows:

                                                              December 31,

(In thousands)                                             2002          2001
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customer contracts                                        $44,963       $43,177
Less: accumulated amortization                            (13,036)       (8,008)
                                                      --------------------------
                                                          $31,927       $35,169
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Had the Company  adopted the  provisions  of Statement 142 as of January 1,
2000, the effects on net income would have been as follows:

     Total intangible  amortization  expense was  approximately  $6.7 million in
2002,  $6.6 million in 2001 and $6.8 million in 2000.  Amortization  of customer
contracts and non-competes was approximately  $6.7 million in 2002, $4.4 million
in 2001 and $4.7 million in 2000 and goodwill  amortization  was $2.2 million in
2001 and $2.1 million in 2000.  Estimated  amortization  expense for each of the
five succeeding fiscal years is as follows:

            December 31,
            -------------------------------------------------
            2003                                      $5,045
            2004                                       4,917
            2005                                       4,826
            2006                                       4,634
            2007                                       4,071
            -------------------------------------------------

5. INCOME TAXES
     The primary  factors  causing  income tax expense to be different  than the
federal statutory rate for 2002 and 2001 are as follows:

     The  Provision  for Income Taxes was based on a 38.0%  estimated  effective
income tax rate on Income Before  Income Taxes for the years ended  December 31,
2002,  2001 and 2000.  The  effective  income tax rate  differs  from the annual
federal  statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes.
For the year ended  December  31,  2002,  the Company paid income taxes of $10.9
million, net of refunds received.  During 2001, the Company paid income taxes of
$5.9 million,  net of refunds. For 2000, the Company received a refund of income
taxes paid of $2.8 million, net of current payments.


     Deferred  income  taxes  reflect  the  net  tax  effects  of the  temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting  purposes  and the amounts used for income tax  purposes.  Significant
components of the Company's  deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31,
2002 and 2001 are as follows:

6. ACCRUAL FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS
     The Company  maintains an accrual for termite  contracts  representing  the
estimated  costs  of   reapplications,   repair  claims  and  associated  labor,
chemicals,  and other costs relative to termite control services performed prior
to the balance  sheet date.  The Company  contracts an  independent  third party
actuary on an annual basis to provide the Company a range of estimated liability
based  upon  historical  claims  information.  The  actuarial  study  is a major
consideration  in  determining  the  accrual  balance  along  with  Management's
knowledge of changes in business practices, contract changes, ongoing claims and
termite  remediation  trends.  The  reserve  is  established  based on all these
factors.  Management  makes judgments  utilizing these  operational  factors but
recognizes  that  they  are  inherently  subjective  due  to the  difficulty  in
predicting  settlements  and awards.  Other  factors that may impact future cost
include chemical life expectancy and governmental regulation.

         A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances is as follows:

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
     The Company has several  operating leases expiring at various dates through
2017. The Company also had a capital lease for certain  computer  equipment that
expired in  February  2001.  The minimum  lease  payments  under  non-cancelable
operating  leases with terms in excess of one year,  in effect at  December  31,
2002, are summarized as follows:

     Total rental expense under operating leases charged to operations was $27.4
million,  $28.7 million and $29.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.


     The  Company  maintains  a credit  facility  with a bank that  allows it to
borrow up to $40.0  million on an  unsecured  basis at the bank's  prime rate of
interest or the indexed  London  Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR).  No amount was
outstanding  under this credit  facility as of December 31, 2002 or December 31,
2001.

     Orkin,  one of the Company's  subsidiaries,  is a named  defendant in Helen
Cutler and Mary Lewin v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al. pending in the
District Court of Houston County, Alabama. The plaintiffs in the above mentioned
case filed suit in March of 1996 and are seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief  for  alleged  breach  of  contract  arising  out of  alleged  missed  or
inadequate reinspections. The attorneys for the plaintiffs contend that the case
is suitable for a class action and the court has ruled that the plaintiffs would
be  permitted  to pursue a class  action  lawsuit  against  Orkin.  The  Company
believes this case to be without  merit and intends to defend itself  vigorously
at  trial.  At  this  time,  the  final  outcome  of the  litigation  cannot  be
determined.  However,  it  is  the  opinion  of  Management  that  the  ultimate
resolution  of this  action  will  not have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     Orkin is also a named  defendant  in Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating
Company, Inc. et al. pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa,
Florida.  The  plaintiffs  filed suit in March of 1999 and are seeking  monetary
damages in excess of $15,000 for each named plaintiff and injunctive  relief for
alleged breach of contract,  fraud and various  violations of Florida state law.
The Court ruled in early April 2002, certifying the class action lawsuit against
Orkin. The Company has appealed this ruling to the Florida Second District Court
of Appeals.  Moreover,  the Company  believes  this case to be without merit and
intends to defend itself vigorously  through trial, if necessary.  At this time,
the final outcome of the  litigation  cannot be determined.  However,  it is the
opinion of Management that the ultimate  resolution of this action will not have
a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  financial  position,  results of
operations or liquidity.

     The Company is involved in certain  environmental matters primarily arising
in the normal course of business.  In the opinion of  Management,  the Company's
liability  under any of these matters would not materially  affect its financial
condition or results of operations.

     Additionally,  in the normal course of business, the Company is a defendant
in a number of  lawsuits,  which allege that  plaintiffs  have been damaged as a
result of the  rendering of services by Company  personnel  and  equipment.  The
Company is actively  contesting these actions.  It is the opinion of Management,
however,  that the  outcome of these  actions  will not have a material  adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
     The  Company  maintains a  noncontributory  tax-qualified  defined  benefit
retirement  plan (the "Plan")  covering all  employees  meeting  certain age and
service   requirements.   The  Plan  provides  benefits  based  on  the  average
compensation  for the highest  five years  during the last ten years of credited
service  (as  defined)  in which  compensation  was  received,  and the  average
anticipated Social Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plan with at
least the minimum amount required by ERISA.  The Company made  contributions  of
$20.0 million to the Plan in 2002. Effective January 1, 2002 the Company adopted
amendments  to the  Plan  including  a change  to the  benefit  calculation  and
limiting  plan  participation  to current  participants.  These  amendments  are
reflected below in the projected benefit obligation.


     The funded status of the Plan and the resulting accrued pension expense are
summarized as follows as of December 31:

     At December 31, 2002 and 2001,  the Plan's assets were  comprised of listed
common  stocks and U.S.  government  and corporate  securities.  Included in the
assets of the Plan were shares of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock with a market value
of $7.7 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


     The Company sponsors a deferred  compensation 401(k) plan that is available
to substantially all employees with six months of service. The plan provides for
a matching  contribution  (made in the form of Common  Stock of the  Company) of
thirty cents ($.30) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions
to the plan  that do not  exceed 6  percent  of his or her  annual  compensation
(which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). The Company match percentage
increased  by 20% in 2002.  The charges to expense  for the  Company  match were
approximately  $2.3  million in 2002,  $2.0  million in 2001 and $2.1 million in
2000. At December 31, 2002 and 2001 approximately 22.9% and 17%, respectively of
the plan assets consisted of Rollins,  Inc. Common Stock.  Total  administrative
fees for the plan were  approximately  $278,500  in 2002,  $308,000  in 2001 and
$228,000 in 2000.

     The  Company has two  Employee  Incentive  Stock  Option  Plans,  the first
adopted in January 1994 (the "1994  Plan") and the second  adopted in April 1998
(the "1998 Plan") as a supplement  to the 1994 Plan. An aggregate of 4.5 million
shares of Common Stock may be granted  under various  stock  incentive  programs
sponsored  by these  plans,  at a price  not less than the  market  value of the
underlying stock on the date of grant. Options may be issued under the 1994 Plan
and the 1998  Plan  through  January  2004 and  April  2008,  respectively.  The
majority of options  expire ten years from the date of grant,  if not exercised,
and vest 20% each year over 5 years.

     Options are also outstanding under a prior Employee  Incentive Stock Option
Plan (the "1984 Plan"). Under this plan, 1.8 million shares of Common Stock were
subject to options  granted  during the ten-year  period ended October 1994. The
options were granted at the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant
and expire ten years from the date of grant,  if not  exercised.  No  additional
options will be granted under the 1984 Plan.

     Option transactions during the last three years for the 1984, 1994 and 1998
plans are summarized as follows:

     Information with respect to options  outstanding and options exercisable at
December 31, 2002 is as follows:



     The  Company  accounts  for  its  1984,  1994  and  1998  plans  under  the
recognition  and  measurement  principles of APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations.  No stock-based employee
compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those
plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the  underlying  common
stock on the date of grant.  The following  table  illustrates the effect on net
income  and  earnings  per  share if the  Company  had  applied  the fair  value
recognition  provisions of FASB Statement No. 123,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.

     The per share  weighted-average  fair value of stock options granted during
2002, 2001, and 2000 was $2.53, $3.57, and $3.67,  respectively,  on the date of
grant,  using  the  Black-Scholes   option-pricing   model  with  the  following

     10. RELATED PARTY  TRANSACTIONS At the Company's  October 22, 2002 Board of
Directors' meeting, the independent directors of the Board of Directors' and the
Audit Committee approved three related party  transactions.  The Audit Committee
and the  independent  directors  were  furnished  with  full  disclosure  of the
transactions, including independent appraisals, and determined that the terms of
each transaction were reasonable and fair to the Company. The first approval was
the purchase of the Rollins Training Center on October 31, 2002 for $3.1 million
from RTC, LLC, a company controlled by R. Randall Rollins, Chairman of the Board
of Rollins,  Inc. The second  approval  was the  purchase of hand-held  computer
software  development  known as  PowerTrak  Version 1.0 from RRR  Associates,  a
company  controlled  by R.  Randall  Rollins.  The  purchase was made during the
fourth quarter at an approved purchase price of $250,000. The third approval was
a lease agreement  effective July 1, 2002 that expires June 30, 2007 for company
real  estate in  Okeechobee  County,  Florida to be leased to Rollins  Ranch,  a
division of LOR,  Inc., a company  controlled by R. Randall  Rollins and Gary W.
Rollins,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  President and Chief  Operating  Officer of
Rollins,  Inc. The annual lease rate on this real estate is $131,939.  It is the
opinion of Management that these related party  transactions were reasonable and
fair to the  Company  and will  not  have a  material  effect  on the  Company's
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     At the  Company's  January  28,  2003  Board  of  Directors'  meeting,  the
independent  directors  of the  Board  of  Directors'  and the  Audit  Committee
approved  four  related  party   transactions.   The  Audit  Committee  and  the
independent  directors were furnished with full disclosure of the  transactions,
including  independent  appraisals,  and  determined  that  the  terms  of  each
transaction were reasonable and fair to the Company and will not have a material
effect on the Company's financial position,  results of operations or liquidity.
The first  approval  was the  ratification  of the current  arrangement  between
Rollins, Inc. and LOR, Inc., a company controlled by R. Randall Rollins and Gary
W.   Rollins,   related  to  sharing  the   aviation   hangar   located  at  the
Dekalb-Peachtree  Airport as well the usage of the Jetstar II, owned by Rollins,
Inc., and Gulfstream III, owned by LOR, Inc. LOR, Inc. leases half of the hangar
from  Rollins,  Inc.  for a total  annual  lease  amount of $13,655.  This lease
expires on January 24, 2008. The hangar currently houses three airplanes, two of
which are not owned by  Rollins,  Inc.  and reside on the  portion of the hangar
leased by LOR,  Inc.  All other  expenses  related to the hangar are also shared
equally  by  Rollins,   Inc.  and  LOR,  Inc.   Total  expenses  for  2002  were
approximately  $114,000,  which  includes  rental,  utilities,  maintenance  and
repairs,  depreciation,  property tax and miscellaneous  expense. The Jetstar II
and Gulfstream  III are used by both Rollins,  Inc. and LOR, Inc. and are billed
on a monthly basis. The Gulfstream III is charged at a rate of $12,750 per month
while the  Jetstar II is charged  at a rate of $5,250  per month.  All  expenses
related to each respective  aircraft are paid for by the owner of each aircraft,
except for fuel.  Fuel is paid for by Rollins,  Inc.  and billed  monthly to the
company using the aircraft. Additionally, Mr. R. Randall Rollins and Mr. Gary W.
Rollins  use the Jetstar II for  personal  use and are billed for its use at the
rate of $1,000 per hour,  which  approximates  the fuel cost.  The total  hourly
usage for 2002 was approximately 6 hours or $6,000. The Company on occasion uses
the  Gulfstream III and is also billed for its use at a rate of $1,000 per hour,
which  approximates  the fuel cost. The second approval was the  ratification of
the  arrangement  concerning the rental of office space to LOR, Inc.  located at
2170 Piedmont Road N.E.,  Atlanta,  Georgia 30324.  The property located at 2170
Piedmont Road is owned by Rollins Continental, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of
Rollins,  Inc. Currently LOR, Inc. occupies  approximately  3,580 square feet of
office space in the building  located at 2170 Piedmont  Road.  The annual rental
rate is $39,029.  The third  approval was the  ratification  of the  arrangement
concerning  the rental of office  space to LOR,  Inc.  located at 710  Lakeshore
Circle, Atlanta,  Georgia 30324. The property located at 710 Lakeshore Circle is
also  owned  by  Rollins   Continental,   Inc.   Currently  LOR,  Inc.  occupies
approximately  3,344 square feet of office space in the building  located at 710
Lakeshore Circle. The annual rental rate is $40,800. The fourth approval was the
ratification of the current  arrangement  related to the payment of fees for the
services of a  programmer/analyst  that was employed by LOR, Inc. but has become
employed by Rollins,  Inc. in the first quarter of 2003. The  programmer/analyst
is being used to further  develop the PowerTrak  Version 1.0 hand-held  computer
software  purchased  in the fourth  quarter of 2002 (as  discussed  in the above
paragraph). The hourly wage paid to LOR, Inc. was $32 per hour, which equated to
$66,560 per year, including overhead. It is the opinion of Management that these
related party  transactions were reasonable and fair to the Company and will not
have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company's  financial  position,  results  of
operations or liquidity.

     Employees  of Rollins,  Inc.  confer with  employees  of LOR,  Inc. and RRR
Associates and vice versa. No fees are charged for these services because in the
opinion of management the activity is mutually beneficial and offsetting.


11. UNAUDITED QUARTERLY DATA
     All earnings per share data have been restated for the three-for-two  stock
split.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure.

     On July 23, 2002 Rollins, Inc. ("Rollins") voted to dismiss its independent
accountants,  Arthur  Andersen LLP  ("Andersen"),  and to engage the services of
Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") to serve as its new independent accountants,
effective  immediately.  This  determination  followed Rollins' decision to seek
proposals from independent  accountants to audit Rollins'  financial  statements
for the fiscal year ending  December 31, 2002. The decision to dismiss  Andersen
and to engage the  services of Ernst & Young was  approved by Rollins'  Board of
Directors upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee.

     During  Rollins' two most recent  fiscal years ended  December 31, 2001 and
2000, and through the date of the Form 8-K filed on July 23, 2002, there were no
disagreements   between  Rollins  and  Andersen  on  any  matter  of  accounting
principles or practices,  financial statement  disclosure,  or auditing scope or
procedure,  which disagreements if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction would
have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the  disagreement in
connection with their reports.

     None  of  the  reportable  events  described  under  Item  304(a)(1)(v)  of
Regulation  S-K  occurred  within  Rollins'  two most recent  fiscal years ended
December  31,  2001 and 2000,  or through the date of the Form 8-K filed on July
23, 2002.

     The audit reports of Andersen on the consolidated  financial  statements of
Rollins and  subsidiaries  as of and for the two fiscal years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion,  nor
were they qualified or modified as to  uncertainty,  audit scope,  or accounting
principles.

     As required under Securities and Exchange Commission  regulations,  Rollins
provided  Andersen with a copy of the foregoing  disclosures  and requested that
Andersen  furnish  Rollins  with a letter  addressed to the  Commission  stating
whether it agrees with the statements by Rollins in this disclosure and, if not,
stating the  respects in which it does not agree.  Although  reasonable  efforts
have been made by  Rollins,  it has been  unable  to obtain  such a letter  from
Andersen.  Rollins  therefore relied on temporary Item 304T(2) of Regulation S-K
in filing its report on Form 8-K.

     During  Rollins' two most recent  fiscal years ended  December 31, 2001 and
2000,  and through the date of the Form 8-K filed on July 23, 2002,  Rollins did
not consult with Ernst & Young with  respect to the  application  of  accounting
principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type
of audit  opinion  that might be  rendered on  Rollins'  consolidated  financial
statements,  or regarding any other  matters or  reportable  events set forth in
Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Item 14. Controls and Procedures.

     Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of our  Management,
including our principal  executive officer and principal  financial officer,  we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in rules 13a-14(c) and 15d -14(c)
under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, within 90 days of the filing date of
this report (the "Evaluation  Date").  Based on this  evaluation,  our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation
Date that our disclosure  controls and  procedures  were effective such that the
material  information  required to be included in our  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  ("SEC")  reports is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and reported
within the time periods  specified  in SEC rules and forms  relating to Rollins,
Inc.,  including our  consolidated  subsidiaries,  and was made known to them by
others within those  entities,  particularly  during the period when this report
was being prepared.

     In addition,  there were no significant changes in our internal controls or
in other factors that could  significantly  affect these controls  subsequent to
the  Evaluation  Date.  We have not  identified  any  significant  deficiency or
material  weaknesses  in our  internal  controls,  and  therefore  there were no
corrective actions taken.

               MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

     The  management  of Rollins,  Inc. is  responsible  for the  integrity  and
objectivity  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  other  financial
information  presented in this report.  These  statements  have been prepared in
conformity with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States
consistently  applied  and  include  amounts  based  on the best  estimates  and
judgments of management.

     Rollins  maintains a system of  internal  accounting  controls  designed to
provide reasonable assurance,  at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded
against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and
can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States. The internal control system
is augmented by written  policies and procedures,  an internal audit program and
the selection and training of qualified personnel. This system includes policies
that require  adherence to ethical  business  standards and compliance  with all
applicable laws and regulations.

     The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002,
have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors,  and the financial
statements  for the years ended  December 31, 2001 and 2000 have been audited by
other  auditors.  In  connection  with its  audit,  Ernst & Young  develops  and
maintains an  understanding  of Rollins'  accounting and financial  controls and
conducts tests of Rollin's accounting systems and other related procedures as it
considers necessary to render an opinion on the financial statements.

     The Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors,  composed solely of outside
directors,  meets periodically with Rollins'  management,  internal auditors and
independent  auditors to review  matters  relating  to the quality of  financial
reporting and internal accounting controls,  and the independent nature,  extent
and  results  of the  audit  effort.  The  Committee  recommends  to  the  Board
appointment  of the  independent  auditors.  Both the internal  auditors and the
independent  auditors  have access to the Audit  Committee,  with or without the
presence of management.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Rollins, Inc.

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  statement  of  financial
position of Rollins,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December  31, 2002,  and the
related consolidated  statements of income,  stockholders' equity and cash flows
for the year then  ended.  Our  audit  also  included  the  financial  statement
schedule  for the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  listed in the Index at Item
15(a).  These financial  statements and schedule are the  responsibility  of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audit. The consolidated financial
statements and schedule of Rollins,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December 31,
2001, and for the two years then ended,  were audited by other auditors who have
ceased  operations  and whose  report  dated  February  15,  2002  expressed  an
unqualified  opinion on those  statements  and schedule  before the  restatement
adjustments described in Notes 1, 4, 5 and 6.

     We conducted our audit in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the 2002  financial  statements  referred to above present
fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of
Rollins,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  at December 31,  2002,  and the  consolidated
results  of their  operations  and their  cash  flows for the year then ended in
conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States.
Also,  in our opinion,  the related  financial  statement  schedule for the year
ended  December 31, 2002,  when  considered  in relation to the basic  financial
statements  taken as a whole,  presents  fairly  in all  material  respects  the
information set forth therein.

     As discussed above, the consolidated  financial  statements and schedule of
Rollins,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2001 and for the two years
then ended  were  audited  by other  auditors  who have  ceased  operations.  As
described  in Note 1, on  January  28,  2003 the  Company's  board of  directors
approved a 3-for-2 stock split,  and all  references to number of shares and per
share information in the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to
reflect the stock split on a retroactive  basis. We audited the adjustments that
were applied to restate the number of shares and per share information reflected
in the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements.  Our procedures included
(a)  agreeing the  authorization  for the 3-for-2  stock split to the  Company's
underlying  records obtained from  management,  and (b) testing the mathematical
accuracy of the  restated  number of shares,  earnings  per share,  common stock
stated at par value and other applicable disclosures such as stock options. Also
as discussed in Note 4, the consolidated  financial statements of Rollins,  Inc.
and  Subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2001 and for the two years then ended have
been revised to include the  transitional  disclosures  required by Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles,  which
was  adopted by the  Company as of January 1, 2002.  Our audit  procedures  with
respect to the  disclosures in Note 4 with respect to 2001 and 2000 included (a)
agreeing the previously  reported net income to the previously  issued financial
statements,  (b) agreeing the  adjustments  to reported net income  representing
amortization  expense  (including  any related tax effects)  recognized in those
periods  related to goodwill  that is no longer  being  amortized as a result of
initially  applying Statement No. 142 (including any related tax effects) to the
Company's  underlying  records obtained from  management,  (c) agreeing all 2001
separate asset and accumulated amortization balances as disclosed for individual
intangibles  to  the  Company's  underlying  accounting  records  obtained  from
management,  (d) agreeing all 2001 and 2000 amortization  expense disclosures to
the Company's  underlying  accounting  records  obtained from management and (e)
testing the mathematical  accuracy of the reconciliation of pro forma net income
to reported net income. Also as discussed in Note 6, the consolidated  financial
statements of Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and for the
two years then ended have been revised to include the transitional



disclosures  required by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's  Accounting and
Disclosure   Requirements  for  Guarantees,   Including  Direct   Guarantees  of
Indebtedness  of Others,  which were  adopted by the Company as of December  31,
2002.  Our audit  procedures  with  respect  to the  disclosures  in Note 6 with
respect to 2001 and 2000 included (a) agreeing the previously reported beginning
and ending  balances  of the accrual for  termite  contracts  to the  previously
issued  financial  statements and (b) agreeing the  provisions and  settlements,
claims and expenditures made during the year to the Company's underlying records
obtained  from  management.  The  disclosures  in  Note  5 of  the  consolidated
financial  statements of Rollins,  Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001
and for the two years then ended have been revised to disclose additional detail
with respect to certain  components  of deferred  income tax amounts.  Our audit
procedures  with  respect  to the  disclosures  in Note 5 with  respect  to 2001
included  agreeing  the  components  of deferred  tax  amounts to the  Company's
underlying  records obtained from management.  In our opinion,  such adjustments
and disclosures are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were
not  engaged  to audit,  review,  or apply any  procedures  to the 2001 and 2000
consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such
adjustments and, accordingly,  we do not express an opinion or any other form of
assurance  on the 2001 and 2000  consolidated  financial  statements  taken as a
whole.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Rollins, Inc.:

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  statements  of  financial  position of
Rollins,  Inc. (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001
and 2000 and the related statements of income, changes in stockholder equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 2001.
These  financial   statements  and  the  schedule  referred  to  below  are  the
responsibility of the Company's Management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free from material  misstatement.  An audit  includes  examining,  on a test
basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  Management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in  all  material  respects,   the  financial  position  of  Rollins,  Inc.  and
subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  2001  and  2000  and the  results  of  their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

     Our  audits  were made for the  purpose  of forming an opinion on the basic
financial  statements  taken as a whole.  The Schedule  listed in Item 14 is the
responsibility  of the  Company's  Management  and is presented  for purposes of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of
the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures  applied in the audits of the basic financial  statements and, in our
opinion,  fairly states in all material  respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic  financial  statements  taken as a
whole.
