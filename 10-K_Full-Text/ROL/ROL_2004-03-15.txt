PART I
Item 1. Business.

General

     Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in 1948 under the
laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

     The Company is a national  service  company  with  headquarters  located in
Atlanta,   Georgia,   providing  pest  and  termite  control  services  to  both
residential  and commercial  customers in North America.  Services are performed
through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

     Orkin, Inc. ("Orkin"),  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company founded in
1901,  is one of the world's  largest  pest and termite  control  companies.  It
provides  customized  services  from over 400  locations  to  approximately  1.6
million  customers.  Orkin  serves  customers in the United  States,  Canada and
Mexico, providing essential pest control services and protection against termite
damage,  rodents and insects to homes and  businesses,  including  hotels,  food
service  establishments,   food  manufacturers,   retailers  and  transportation
companies.   Orkin  operates  under  the  Orkin(R)  and  PCO  Services,  Inc.(R)
trademarks  and the AcuridSM  service mark.  The Orkin(R) brand name makes Orkin
the most recognized  pest and termite  company in the country.  The PCO Services
brand name provides  similar  brand  recognition  in Canada.  The Company is the
largest pest control provider in Canada.

     The Company has only one reportable  segment,  its pest and termite control
business.  Revenue,  operating profit and identifiable  assets for this segment,
which includes the United States,  Canada and Mexico,  are included in Item 8 of
this document under financial  statements and supplementary data on pages 24 and
25. The  Company's  results of operations  and its  financial  condition are not
reliant upon any single  customer or a few  customers or the  Company's  foreign
operations.

     A bimonthly pest control service  initiative was offered in limited markets
beginning in 1999 and was implemented as a primary  service  offering in 2000 to
better service our residential customers,  and has grown to represent 55% of the
residential  customer  base at the end of 2003.  This program  provides  greater
convenience  to our  customers  and enables  the  Company to achieve  technician
productivity improvements and other service efficiencies,  including lower fleet
costs.

     In order to better  understand  its  customers and  prospects,  in 2003 the
Company initiated market research efforts to help identify specific  residential
pest control market segments. Three segments were determined to be the ideal new
customer groups for Orkin. These are sectors that the Company believes offer the
best  opportunity  to  create  long  and  prosperous  relationships.  Management
believes  that all of these  groups are willing to pay a higher price for a pest
control  service that meets their needs.  They  indicated a desire for a company
with a strong  positive  reputation,  and one with  the  most  professional  and
knowledgeable  technicians.  They also want to do business  with a company whose
service will be safe for their  children and pets, and a firm that is responsive
to their requests.  These are attributes that Orkin delivers every day; however,
this validation will enable the Company to do a better job  communicating  these
strengths.

     To  effectively  and  efficiently  achieve  sales  goals in today's  highly
competitive environment,  representatives have a greater need for new technology
to help them improve their  productivity.  Orkin began testing  automated  sales
management  software in 2003. This software is currently being used to track the
sales  process,  allowing the  pipelines to be easily  reviewed to capitalize on
opportunities  that are readily  identified.  Account  information,  statistics,
contact information, future tasks and events are tracked by location with upward
flow  to the  sales  management  organization.  The  reporting  and  forecasting
features also enable management to have a better overview and expectation of the
entire network.

     The  Company  has also  reorganized  its  marketing  department  to include
Business  Development  Managers  (BDM).  Each BDM is responsible  for creating a
market  development plan for future customer growth and retention for his or her
division.  They provide advocacy by working with local,  regional and divisional
management  to ensure  the  success  of their  division  as it  relates to sales
training, new customer marketing and sales plan achievement.

     In 2003, Orkin developed a corporate  partnership with the National Science
Teachers Association (NSTA) that is designed to assist teachers in educating the
country's  youth  about the  importance  of  insects  in the  environment.  As a
partner,  we are  providing  teaching and  instructional  materials  directly to
teachers and through the


NSTA's  website.  All this  behind-the-scenes  support is further  reinforced by
offering a "real live" Orkin Man to provide in-school presentations.

     Orkin's  commercial pest control  programs enable us to deliver  customized
service to industries  such as food  processing and  distribution,  discount and
grocery  retailers,  fast food,  healthcare  and  restaurants.  As the  nation's
largest  commercial pest control provider,  the Company services national chains
(primarily  sold  through  the  Orkin  National  Accounts  division)  as well as
locally-owned  businesses.  A primary  goal of the  Company is to grow  national
account  revenue  at a pace that will  enable us to  further  expand  our market
share.

     Orkin introduced the Gold Medal Protection  program in the United States in
2003. This custom-designed pest control service is targeted to specific high-end
customers  primarily in the food  manufacturing  and  processing  industry.  The
program  provides a comprehensive  reporting system that meets federal and state
regulatory requirements.  It also guarantees free retreatment if the customer is
not satisfied and Orkin commits to paying any  regulatory  penalties as a result
of a shortfall  in our service.  This is the first pest  control  program of its
kind in North America to receive ISO 9002 certification.

     Also in 2003, the Company also introduced a Commercial Pest Control Quality
Assurance Program.  This program helps ensure consistent  service,  improves our
personnel  and  builds  stronger  customer   relations.   The  program  utilizes
floor-level  inspections by Orkin Q.A.  inspectors while  accompanied by branch,
region, and on occasion division management staff. A new Commercial Pest Control
Expectation  Manual was  developed for our branches to clearly  communicate  the
Company's service expectations, and our locations and people are audited against
this manual.

     Research has shown that termites  cause more damage to American  structures
than fires and storms combined.  Orkin offers a treatment customized to a home's
needs including inside,  outside and within the foundation.  Our directed liquid
and directed  liquid plus bait programs have been developed in conjunction  with
the entomology departments at leading universities. As a result, our approach to
treating for subterranean  termites has become the standard adopted by most pest
control operators today.

     Orkin  is  leveraging   recent   investments   in  technology  and  process
improvement  to advance  business  practices in the  commercial  business  line.
Re-engineering  efforts are targeted at  enhancing  integration  between  sales,
customer management,  service delivery and billing processes to provide a higher
level of service to these customers.

     In 2003, the Company successfully launched its new Intranet, which provides
quick and efficient  communications  between the field and home office.  Through
the efforts of our Company Webmaster and the Web Advisory Committee,  there were
several key  milestones  achieved this year. The Intranet  provided  significant
cost savings by providing Material Safety Data Sheets and Product Labels through
MyOrkin   Intranet.   This  is  a  very  important   requirement   that  enables
instantaneous  compliance  with state and federal product use  regulations.  The
Orkin  Training   Department  now  has  a  state-of-the-art  means  to  better
communicate  the  availability  of an  elaborate  array of  training  tools  and
reference materials through the MyOrkin/Training site. The  MyOrkin/Marketplace,
another company Intranet  address,  was created for branches to more efficiently
order promotional products and company forms.

     In  2003,  Orkin  began  outsourcing  some  of  its  chemical  distribution
utilizing new Internet  branch systems to ease ordering of product.  Test branch
locations  are now  receiving  shipments in two to four days while  reducing the
carrying cost of excess inventory and shipping costs.

     The Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, introduced three years ago,
has  resulted  in improved  driver  safety and service  production.  Now,  newer
generation  GPS units are  being  installed  that  allow 24 / 7  monitoring  and
reporting  of speed,  location,  and seatbelt  usage as well as allowing  remote
updating of mapping  software.  This technology also details the route a service
technician takes rather than just noting stops.  These units create reports that
are  easier  to read and  allow  data to be sent  directly  to a server  with no
removable chip to be taken out at the end of the day. Although this equipment is
only being utilized in some of our locations,  we are optimistic that it will be
a building block to creating a comprehensive  "routing and scheduling" system in
the future.

     As part of our continuous home office process improvement  mandate, a Human
Resources  Service Center was  established  from three  autonomous  departments:
Payroll,  Benefits and Human  Resources.  Everything from new-hire  paperwork to
retirement forms is now available  through this new center.  We are pleased that
this consolidation has improved our service to the field while reducing costs.



     The dollar amount of service  contracts and backlog orders as of the end of
the Company's 2003 and 2002 calendar years was  approximately  $31.3 million and
$28.4 million,  respectively.  Backlog  services and orders are usually provided
within the month  following the month of receipt,  except in the area of prepaid
pest control and bait  monitoring  services,  which are usually  provided within
twelve  months of receipt.  The Company does not have a material  portion of its
business  that may be subject to  renegotiation  of  profits or  termination  of
contracts at the election of a governmental entity.

     In spring 2003, Orkin was recognized by Training magazine as one of the Top
100 companies to excel in training and employee development.  In addition, Orkin
was one of only five companies selected for the magazine's Editor's Choice list.
The  award is given to select  companies  that have  created  positive  learning
environments for their workforce.

     Orkin attained  further  recognition  this year for its training program by
achieving  first place honors for the BEST Award given by the  American  Society
for Training and Development.  The Rollins Training Center,  located in Atlanta,
was specifically  referenced as evidence of the Company's dedication to employee
performance  improvement.  The Rollins Training Center has a full-size house and
several other real examples of building structures where technicians can see the
relationship  between  pests  and home  construction.  They  can  also  practice
performing pest treatments  under the supervision of qualified  instructors.  In
the classrooms, technicians acquire guidance in customer relations, pest problem
solving and advanced technical skills through highly interactive  instructor-led
training.

     In 2004,  the  Company  plans to expand  the  Training  Center  to  include
hands-on   instructional   areas  for  commercial  pest  control  services  with
additional classroom space and a media production facility.

     The  Rollins   Customer   Care  Center   achieved   its  ISO  9002  quality
certification in 2001. It is joined by forty-seven dedicated commercial branches
that have also completed the ISO 9002 quality certification process.

     The Company  continues  to expand its growth  through  the Orkin  franchise
program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently
not  economically  feasible to locate a  conventional  Orkin branch.  There is a
contractual  buyback  provision at the  Company's  option with a  pre-determined
purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise.  There were
44 Company franchises at the end of 2003 compared to 36 at the end of 2002.

Seasonality

     The  business  of the Company is  affected  by the  seasonal  nature of the
Company's pest and termite control  services.  The increase in pest pressure and
activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the
occurrence of which is  determined by the timing of the change in seasons),  has
historically  resulted in an increase in the revenue of the  Company's  pest and
termite  control  operations  during such periods as evidenced by the  following
chart.

Inventories

     The Company has  relationships  with multiple  vendors for pest and termite
control  treatment  products  and  maintains a  sufficient  level of  chemicals,
materials  and other  supplies to fulfill its immediate  servicing  needs and to
alleviate any potential  short-term  shortage in availability  from its national
network of suppliers.

Competition

     The Company believes that Orkin competes  favorably with competitors as one
of the world's largest pest and termite control companies.  The Company competes
with a number of pest and termite  control  companies,  including  Terminix  and
Ecolab.


     The principal  methods of  competition  in the  Company's  pest and termite
control business are quality of service and guarantees, including the money-back
guarantee on pest and termite  control,  and the termite  retreatment and damage
repair guarantee to qualified homeowners.

Research and Development

     Expenditures  by  the  Company  on  research  activities  relating  to  the
development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and
improved service methods and products are researched,  developed and produced by
unaffiliated  universities  and companies.  Also, a portion of these methods and
products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company. Some of the
more recent  studies that have been  conducted on behalf of the Company  include
studies on fly  pathogens,  ant  pathogens,  and other  pests  found in the food
processing environment by the University of Florida. Additionally, an integrated
pest  management  study  completed  in  2003,  was  performed  by  the  Virginia
Polytechnic Institute. Additional research at the University of Florida involves
the impact of soil type and soil  compaction  on termites'  tunneling  behavior.
Also,  Texas A&M has  continued  studies on both  termites and fire ants,  using
biological  control  agents for  population  reduction and  predicting  the time
termites  swarm each year.  The Company also conducts tests of new products with
the specific  manufacturers of such products. In the summer of 2003, Orkin began
test  marketing a mosquito  control  program in the United  States and  Canadian
provinces. While working to address the threat of mosquito-borne diseases in the
U.S., a highly  successful  West Nile Virus program was  implemented in Ontario,
Canada. It provided thousands of larvicide  treatments on breeding grounds while
reducing the  population of adult,  biting  mosquitoes.  The Company  intends to
expand the  mosquito  control  program  in Canada and other U.S.  markets in the
spring of 2004.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

     The Company's Pest Control  business is subject to various  legislative and
regulatory  enactments  that are  designed  to protect the  environment,  public
health and consumer protection. Compliance with these requirements has not had a
material  negative  effect  on the  Company's  financial  position,  results  of
operations or liquidity.

Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act ("FIFRA")

     This federal law (as amended) grants the responsibility of the states to be
the  primary  agent in  enforcement  and  conditions  under  which pest  control
companies operate.  Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental
Protection  Agency in  regulating  the  following:  licensing,  record  keeping,
contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This
allows  each  state to  institute  certain  features  that set their  regulatory
programs in keeping  with  special  interests  of the  citizens'  wishes in each
state.  The pest  control  industry  is  impacted  by these  federal  and  state
regulations.

Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 ("FQPA")

     The FQPA governs the manufacture,  labeling, handling and use of pesticides
and does not have a direct impact on how we conduct our business.

Environmental Remediation

     The Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation and Liability Act
("CERCLA"),  also known as Superfund,  is the primary Federal statute regulating
the cleanup of inactive  hazardous  substance  sites and imposing  liability for
cleanup on the responsible  parties.  Responsibilities  governed by this statute
include the management of hazardous substances,  reporting releases of hazardous
substances,  and establishing the necessary  contracts and agreements to conduct
cleanup.  Customarily, the parties involved will work with the EPA and under the
direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site
remediation.

Employees

     The number of persons  employed by the Company as of February  27, 2004 was
approximately 7,300 compared to 7,600 at December 31, 2002. This decrease in the
number of employees is due to the continued transition to every-other-month pest
control service, which has resulted in the need for fewer technicians.


Recent Developments

     The Board of  Directors,  at its  quarterly  meeting on January  27,  2004,
approved a 20%  increase in the  Company's  quarterly  dividend.  The  increased
regular quarterly  dividend of $0.06 per share will be payable March 10, 2004 to
stockholders of record at the close of business February 10, 2004. The Company's
new annual dividend rate is $0.24 per share.

     On March 8, 2004,  the  Company  entered  into a  definitive  agreement  to
acquire,  through a purchase of assets,  the pest  control  business and certain
ancillary  operations  of  Western  Industries,  Inc.  and its  affiliates.  The
aggregate  consideration  will be paid in a combination  of cash and  marketable
securities,  on hand as well as borrowings  from an outside party to be arranged
in  connection  with the purchase,  and is expected to range from  approximately
$105.0 to $110.0  million.  The amount to be financed has not been determined at
this time.  The Company is  anticipating  closing on the  purchase in the second
quarter of 2004.

and Exchange Commission.

Risk Factors

We may not be able to compete in the  competitive  and  technical  pest  control
industry in the future.

     We operate in a highly competitive industry.  Our revenues and earnings may
be affected by the following  factors:  changes in competitive  prices,  weather
related issues, general economic issues and governmental regulation.  We compete
with other large pest control companies,  as well as numerous small pest control
companies  for a finite  number of  customers.  We  believe  that the  principal
competitive  factors in the market  areas that we serve are  product and service
quality and  availability,  reputation  for safety,  technical  proficiency  and
price.  Although we believe that our  experience  and  reputation for safety and
quality service is excellent,  we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain
our competitive position.

We  may  not  be  able  to  identify,   complete  or  successfully   consolidate
acquisitions.

     Acquisitions  have been and will continue to be an important element of our
business strategy. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire
acceptable  acquisition  candidates on terms  favorable to us in the future.  We
cannot assure that we will be able to  consolidate  successfully  the operations
and assets of any acquired business with our own business.  Any inability on our
part to consolidate and manage the growth from acquired  businesses could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

     Our operations are directly  affected by the weather  conditions across the
United  States and  Canada.  The  business  of the  Company is  affected  by the
seasonal nature of the Company's pest and termite control services. The increase
in pest pressure and activity,  as well as the  metamorphosis of termites in the
spring and summer (the  occurrence  of which is  determined by the timing of the
change in seasons),  has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and
income of the Company's pest and termite control operations during such periods.

Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth  potential
and profitability.

     Our ability to remain  productive and profitable will depend  substantially
on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers.  Our ability to expand our
operations is in part  impacted by our ability to increase our labor force.  The
demand  for  skilled  employees  is high,  and the  supply  is very  limited.  A
significant  increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a
reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates paid by us, or
both. If either of these events occurred,  our capacity and profitability  could
be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

Our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.

     In the  normal  course of  business,  Orkin is a  defendant  in a number of
lawsuits,  including Helen Cutler and Mary Lewin v. Orkin Exterminating Company,
Inc. et al. pending in the District Court of Houston County, Alabama


and Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc. et al. pending in the
Circuit  Court  of  Hillsborough  County,   Tampa,  Florida  which  allege  that
plaintiffs  have been damaged as a result of the  rendering of services by Orkin
personnel  and  equipment.  Orkin is actively  contesting  these  actions.  Some
lawsuits have been filed (Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin
Exterminating Company, Inc., et al.; Elizabeth Allen and William Allen et al. v.
Rollins, Inc. and Orkin Exterminating  Company,  Inc.; Francis D. Petsch, et al.
v.  Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc.  et al.;  and Bob J.  Stevens  v. Orkin
Exterminating  Company,  Inc. and  Rollins,  Inc.) in which the  Plaintiffs  are
seeking  certification of a class. The cases originate in Georgia,  Florida, and
Texas.  The Company  believes them to be without merit and intends to vigorously
contest  certification  and defend itself  through trial,  if necessary.  In the
opinion of  Management,  the outcome of these  actions  will not have a material
adverse  effect on the Company's  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity.

Our  operations  may be  adversely  affected  if we are  unable to  comply  with
regulatory and environmental laws.

     Our  business is  significantly  affected by  environmental  laws and other
regulations  relating to the pest  control  industry and by changes in such laws
and the level of enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of
enforcement of existing laws and regulations,  how such laws and regulations may
be interpreted by enforcement  agencies or court rulings,  or whether additional
laws  and  regulations  will be  adopted.  We  believe  our  present  operations
substantially  comply with applicable  federal and state  environmental laws and
regulations.  We also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material
adverse effect on our operations to date.  However,  such environmental laws are
changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in
the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition.  Penalties
for noncompliance with these laws may include  cancellation of licenses,  fines,
and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial
results.

Item 2. Properties.

     The Company's  administrative  headquarters and central warehouse,  both of
which are  owned by the  Company,  are  located  at 2170  Piedmont  Road,  N.E.,
Atlanta,  Georgia  30324.  The Company  owns or leases  several  hundred  branch
offices and  operating  facilities  used in its  business as well as the Rollins
Training  Center  located  in  Atlanta,  Georgia.  None of the  branch  offices,
individually considered,  represents a materially important physical property of
the Company.  The  facilities  are suitable and adequate to meet the current and
reasonably anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

     Orkin,  one of the Company's  subsidiaries,  is a named  defendant in Helen
Cutler and Mary Lewin v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al. pending in the
District Court of Houston County, Alabama. The plaintiffs in the above mentioned
case filed suit in March of 1996 and are seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief  for  alleged  breach  of  contract  arising  out of  alleged  missed  or
inadequate reinspections. The attorneys for the plaintiffs contend that the case
is suitable for a class action and the court has ruled that the plaintiffs would
be permitted to pursue a class action lawsuit against Orkin. Orkin believes this
case to be without merit and intends to defend itself  vigorously at trial.  The
trial is currently set for early June 2004.  At this time,  the final outcome of
the litigation cannot be determined.  However, in the opinion of Management, the
ultimate  resolution of this action will not have a material  adverse  effect on
the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     Orkin is also a named  defendant  in Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating
Company, Inc. et al. pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa,
Florida.  The  plaintiffs  filed suit in March of 1999 and are seeking  monetary
damages and injunctive relief.  The Court ruled in early April 2002,  certifying
the class  action  lawsuit  against  Orkin.  Orkin  appealed  this ruling to the
Florida  Second  District  Court of Appeals which  remanded the case back to the
trial court for further  findings.  Orkin believes this case to be without merit
and intends to defend itself  vigorously  through trial,  if necessary.  At this
time, the final outcome of the litigation cannot be determined.  However, in the
opinion of  Management,  the ultimate  resolution of this action will not have a
material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  financial  position,  results  of
operations or liquidity.

     Orkin is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the
normal course of business. In the opinion of Management, the Company's liability
under any of these matters would not materially  affect its financial  condition
or results of operations.


     Additionally,  in the normal course of business,  Orkin is a defendant in a
number of lawsuits,  which allege that  plaintiffs have been damaged as a result
of the rendering of services by Orkin personnel and equipment. Orkin is actively
contesting  these  actions.  Some lawsuits have been filed (Ernest W. Warren and
Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc., et al.; Elizabeth
Allen and William Allen et al. v. Rollins, Inc. and Orkin Exterminating Company,
Inc.; Francis D. Petsch, et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al.; and
Bob J. Stevens v. Orkin Exterminating  Company, Inc. and Rollins, Inc.) in which
the  Plaintiffs are seeking  certification  of a class.  The cases  originate in
Georgia,  Florida,  and Texas. The Company believes them to be without merit and
intends to vigorously contest  certification and defend itself through trial, if
necessary.  In the opinion of Management,  the outcome of these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial  position,  results of
operations or liquidity.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


General Operating Comments

     The Company's continued emphasis on customer retention, along with building
recurring  revenues,  was the  primary  driver of revenue  growth of 3.0% in the
fourth  quarter and 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the
prior year periods,  despite a sluggish  economy and  unseasonably  wet and cold
weather conditions in parts of the U.S. in the first half of 2003. Revenues were
up 1.2% in the first  quarter,  0.5% in the second quarter and 2.4% in the third
quarter as compared to the prior year periods.

     The  financial  results for the fourth  quarter and the twelve months ended
December  31,  2003 were  positively  impacted by the  continued  benefit of our
recent service initiatives,  which included  every-other-month  residential pest
control  service,  Gold Medal  premium  commercial  pest control  services,  and
termite directed liquid and baiting treatment.

     For the fourth  quarter of 2003, the Company had net income of $4.8 million
compared  to net income of $3.7  million in the  fourth  quarter of 2002,  which
represents a 29.5%  increase.  In addition to the revenue  increase of 3.0%, the
Company  achieved  margin  improvement  in  Cost  of  Services  Provided  of 1.3
percentage points, expressed as a percentage of revenues,  offset by an increase
in Sales,  General  and  Administrative  expenses  of 0.4 margin  points or $2.2
million due to higher marketing expenses.  In addition,  the Company recorded an
increase in its tax provision of approximately $1.1 million as describes further
below.

     For the year ended  December 31, 2003,  the Company had net income of $35.8
million  compared to net income of $27.1  million in 2002,  which  represents  a
31.9%  increase.  In  addition  to the  revenue  increase  of 1.7%,  the Company
achieved margin improvements,  expressed as a percentage of revenues, in Cost of
Services  Provided  of  0.8  percentage   points  and  in  Sales,   General  and
Administrative of 0.9 percentage points.

     For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company generated additional cash
of $21.2 million  compared to $29.7 million for 2002. The Company had total Cash
and  Short-Term  Investments  of $59.5  million as of December  31, 2003 a 55.4%
increase from December 31, 2002.

     The Company  began its Orkin  franchise  program in the U.S. in 1994,  and
established its first international  franchise in Mexico in 2000. On October 10,
2003, the Company  announced the establishment of a second  international  Orkin
franchise in Panama. At December 31, 2003, Orkin had 44 franchises in total.

Results of Operations - 2003 Versus 2002

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $677.0  million,  an increase
of $11.6  million  or 1.7% from last  year's  revenues  of $665.4  million.  The
Company's revenue growth was very similar across its primary services, which are
residential  pest control,  commercial pest control,  and termite  service.  The
growth in pest  control  revenues for the year  reflects  growth in the customer
base,  better  average  selling  prices,   continued  improvements  in  customer
retention, and successful price increase campaigns.  Every-other-month  service,
our primary  residential  pest control  service  offering,  continues to grow in
importance,  comprising  55% of our  residential  pest control  customer base at
December 31, 2003. In commercial pest control,  the Company continued to receive
favorable  reaction  to the  rollout of its premium  Gold Medal  service,  which
specifically  targets food  processing  and  manufacturing  companies,  and also
achieved  improvements  in  average  prices on new sales  and  successful  price
increases from existing customers.  This past summer, Orkin began test marketing
a mosquito  control  program in the  northern  United  States and Canada.  While
working to address the threat of  mosquito-borne  diseases in the U.S., a highly
successful West Nile virus preventative program was also implemented in Ontario,
Canada.  Two  provinces  were  provided  thousands  of larvicide  treatments  to
mosquito  breeding grounds reducing the population of adult mosquitoes and their
eggs. The Company intends  to expand the mosquito  control program in Canada and
other U.S.  markets in the spring of 2004. As another sign of  strengthening  in
the commercial  market,  the Company  achieved a monthly record high of sales to
national accounts in September 2003.

Termite  revenues  increased in the fourth quarter as a result of higher new job
completions and continued growth in recurring  revenues from bait monitoring and
renewal revenues, although termite revenues for the twelve months ended December
31, 2003  decreased  slightly,  mainly as a result of the unusually wet and cold
weather  in parts of the  U.S.  in the  first  half of  2003.  Per the  National
Climatic Data Center's 109 years of tracking  weather data,  temperatures in the
Northeast  Region  of the  country  were the 10th  coldest  on  record,  and the
Southeast  experienced  the  second  wettest  six month  period on  record.  The
Company's  foreign  operations  accounted for approximately 6% of total revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2003.


The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal  nature of the Company's
pest and termite control services as evidenced by the following chart.

                                           Total Net Revenues
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               2003               2002              2001
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First Quarter                 $155,122          $153,302           $150,280
Second Quarter                 185,105           184,189            180,731
Third Quarter                  178,262           174,063            169,223
Fourth Quarter                 158,524           153,871            149,691
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cost of Services  Provided for the year ended  December 31, 2003  increased $1.1
million or 0.3%,  although  the expense  margin  expressed  as a  percentage  of
revenues improved by 0.8 percentage  points,  representing 53.5% of revenues for
the year ended  December  31,  2003  compared  to 54.3% of revenues in the prior
year. The dollar increase was mainly due to an increase in fleet expenses,  as a
result of higher fuel costs and a temporary spike in vehicle counts in the first
quarter as the Company transitioned to a new fleet agreement, and an increase in
fringe benefit costs due to higher  pension and group medical  costs,  partially
offset  by  improvements  in  service  salaries,  administrative  salaries,  and
materials  and  supplies.   Service  technician  productivity  and  average  pay
continued  to  improve,  which  leads  to  better  employee  retention  and,  in
Management's opinion, improved customer retention.

Sales, General and Administrative for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased
$1.7  million  or  0.7%  and,  as a  percentage  of  revenues,  improved  by 0.9
percentage  points or 2.5%,  averaging 34.9% of total revenues compared to 35.8%
for the prior year. The improvement for the year was a result of the home office
process improvement initiative started in 2002, lower field administrative costs
as a result of technology and  organizational  investments,  lower sales payroll
due to lower  staffing and partly from the  formation of in-bound  call centers,
and lower bad debt expenses due to better  collections  and  improvement  in the
receivables  aging  statistics.  These were  partially  offset by higher  fringe
benefit costs, advertising, and an increase in the summer sales program costs.

Depreciation and Amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were
$1.5 million or 6.7% lower than the prior year.  The decrease was due to certain
technology  assets  becoming fully  depreciated  in the last twelve months.  The
Company had approximately $10.6 million in capital  expenditures during the year
ended December 31, 2003 compared to $10.4 million in 2002.

In  addition,  the Company  realized a net gain of $1.7 million from the sale or
disposal of assets in the fourth quarter of 2003.

The  Company's  effective tax rate was 38.0% for the periods prior to the fourth
quarter  of 2003.  The  effective  tax rate  was  increased  to 40.4% in 2003 to
reflect an increase in the effective state income tax rate for the year, as well
as "true up" adjustments in the fourth quarter of approximately $1.1 million. As
a result, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter increased to 52.4%.

Results of Operations - 2002 Versus 2001

Revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2002 increased to $665.4  million,  an
increase  of $15.5  million or 2.4% from 2001  revenues of $649.9  million.  The
Company's  foreign  operations  made up less  than 6.0% of the  Company's  total
revenues in 2002 and 2001.  The revenue  increase was mainly  attributable  to a
modest increase in revenues from pest control services, as termite revenues were
flat with the prior  year.  The growth in pest  control  revenues  reflects  the
beneficial  impact of better  customer  retention  and a successful  residential
summer  sales  program,  factors  that  combined  to  produce  a net gain in the
customer base as well as higher  average  selling  prices.  Within the U.S., the
Company had an improvement in customer retention, a modest increase in new sales
units and an overall  improvement  in average  selling  prices,  resulting  in a
higher ending customer base at the end of the year.  Every-other-month  service,
our primary  residential  pest control  service  offering,  continued to grow in
importance,  comprising almost 50% of our residential pest control customer base
at the end of 2002. Our commercial  revenues grew,  mainly as a result of better
pricing  on new  sales,  a  successful  price  increase  campaign  for  existing
customers in 2002, and the  introduction of new products and services during the
year.  Although  termite revenues were flat in 2002 as a result of a decrease in
sales to new  customers,  the Company  experienced  an  improvement in recurring


revenues  mainly from  enhanced  renewal  retention  and higher bait  monitoring
services.  Despite the decrease in termite sales dollars, the Company managed to
achieve a slight improvement in average selling prices.

Cost of  Services  Provided  for the year  ended  December  31,  2002  decreased
$603,000 or 0.2% and margins  improved by 1.4  percentage  points,  representing
54.3% of  revenues  in 2002  compared  to 55.7% of  revenues  in the prior year.
Improvement for the year ended December 31, 2002 can be mainly attributed to the
Company's recent service initiatives that have increased  productivity,  reduced
headcount,  and created other  efficiencies  and better asset  utilization.  The
Company achieved  reductions in service  salaries,  personnel  related expenses,
materials and supplies, travel and fleet expense, which were partially offset by
slightly  higher  insurance  and  claims  charges.   Pest  control  and  termite
technician  productivity  improved,  as  did  employee  retention.  The  Company
believes  that  better  employee  retention  has a  direct  impact  on  customer
retention.  Better fleet  management  led to a decrease in the average number of
vehicles and an improvement in revenues per vehicle.

Sales, General and Administrative for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased
$2.4 million or 1.0%, and improved by 1.2 percentage  points in 2002,  averaging
35.8% of total revenues  compared to 37.0% for the prior year.  Improvement  for
the year was mainly  attributed to reduced  personnel  related  expenses,  fleet
expense,   telephone  expense,  travel  expense,  bad  debt  expense  and  sales
promotions,  partially  offset by higher  summer  selling  program  expense  and
advertising expense.

Depreciation and Amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were
approximately  $1.3 million or 6.6% higher than the prior year. The increase was
primarily  due to the  depreciation  associated  with FOCUS,  the  Company's new
proprietary  branch  computer  system.  The rollout of FOCUS to the branches was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2001. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No.
142, the  amortization of goodwill has been  discontinued as of January 1, 2002,
causing a  decrease  in  goodwill  amortization  expense of  approximately  $2.2
million partially offset by an increase in amortization  expense of $2.0 million
due to a change in the expected life of customer contracts.

The Loss on Sale of Assets for the year ended  December 31, 2002 of $762,000 was
mainly due to the write-off of obsolete field IT equipment.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes the effects of adopting
SFAS No.  142,  which did not have a material  impact on the  Company's  overall
results of operations. In addition, if SFAS No. 142 had been adopted in the year
ended  December 31, 2001, it would not have had a material  impact on net income
previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2001.

The Company's  tax  provision of $16.6  million for the year ended  December 31,
2002 reflects  increased  taxable  income over the prior year. The effective tax
rate of 38% was consistent between periods presented.

Related Party Transactions

     At the  Company's  October  22,  2002  Board  of  Directors'  meeting,  the
independent directors of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee approved
three  related  party  transactions.  The Audit  Committee  and the  independent
directors  were furnished with full  disclosure of the  transactions,  including
independent  appraisals,  and determined that the terms of each transaction were
reasonable  and fair to the Company.  The first approval was the purchase of the
Rollins  Training  Center on October 31, 2002 for $3.1 million from RTC,  LLC, a
company controlled by R. Randall Rollins, Chairman of the Board of Rollins, Inc.
The second approval was the purchase of hand-held computer software  development
known as PowerTrak Version 1.0 from RRR Associates,  a company  controlled by R.
Randall  Rollins.  The purchase was made during the fourth quarter of 2002 at an
approved  purchase price of $250,000.  The third approval was a lease  agreement
effective  July 1, 2002 that  expires  June 30, 2007 for company  real estate in
Okeechobee  County,  Florida to be leased to Rollins  Ranch,  a division of LOR,
Inc., a company  controlled  by R. Randall  Rollins and Gary W.  Rollins,  Chief
Executive  Officer,  President and Chief Operating Officer of Rollins,  Inc. The
annual lease rate on this real estate is $131,939. In the opinion of Management,
these related party  transactions  were  reasonable  and fair to the Company and
will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position,  results of
operations or liquidity.

     At the  Company's  January  28,  2003  Board  of  Directors'  meeting,  the
independent directors of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee approved
four  related  party  transactions.  The  Audit  Committee  and the  independent
directors  were furnished with full  disclosure of the  transactions,  including
independent  appraisals,  and determined that the terms of each transaction were
reasonable  and fair to the Company  and will not have a material


effect on the Company's financial position,  results of operations or liquidity.
The first  approval  was the  ratification  of the current  arrangement  between
Rollins, Inc. and LOR, Inc., a company controlled by R. Randall Rollins and Gary
W.   Rollins,   related  to  sharing  the   aviation   hangar   located  at  the
Dekalb-Peachtree Airport as well as the usage of a JetStar II, owned by Rollins,
Inc., and the  Gulfstream III N30WR,  owned by LOR, Inc. The Jetstar II was sold
by Rollins,  Inc. in October 2003 and Rollins,  Inc.  purchased a Gulstream  III
N330WR to replace it in October 2003 (see  discussion  below).  LOR, Inc. leases
half of the  hangar  from  Rollins,  Inc.  for a total  annual  lease  amount of
$14,873.  This lease expires on January 24, 2008.  The hangar  currently  houses
three airplanes,  two of which are not owned by Rollins,  Inc. and reside on the
portion of the hangar  leased by LOR,  Inc.  All other  expenses  related to the
hangar are also shared equally by Rollins, Inc. and LOR, Inc. Total expenses for
2003 were approximately $116,000, which includes rental, utilities,  maintenance
and repairs,  depreciation,  property tax and miscellaneous expense. Pursuant to
this  arrangement  the usage is billed on a monthly  basis.  The  Jetstar II was
charged  at a rate of  $5,250  before  it was sold and the  Gulstream  III's are
charged  at a rate of $12,745  each,  per month.  All  expenses  related to each
respective aircraft are paid for by the owner of each aircraft, except for fuel.
Fuel is paid for by Rollins,  Inc. and billed  monthly to the company  using the
aircraft. Additionally, when Mr. R. Randall Rollins and Mr. Gary W. Rollins used
the JetStar II, prior to its sale, or use the Gulfstream III N330WR for personal
use  they  are  billed  for  such use at the  rate of  $1,000  per  hour,  which
approximates  the fuel cost.  The total hourly usage for 2003 was  approximately
5.4 hours or $5,400.  The Company on occasion uses the  Gulfstream III N30WR and
is also billed for its use at a rate of $1,000 per hour, which  approximates the
fuel  cost.  The  second  approval  was  the  ratification  of  the  arrangement
concerning the rental of office space to LOR, Inc. located at 2170 Piedmont Road
N.E.,  Atlanta,  Georgia  30324.  The property  located at 2170 Piedmont Road is
owned by Rollins  Continental,  Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Rollins,  Inc.
Currently LOR, Inc.  occupies  approximately  360 square feet of office space in
the building  located at 2170 Piedmont  Road.  The annual rental rate is $3,924.
The third approval was the ratification of the arrangement concerning the rental
of office space to LOR, Inc. located at 710 Lakeshore Circle,  Atlanta,  Georgia
30324.  The property  located at 710  Lakeshore  Circle is also owned by Rollins
Continental,  Inc. Currently LOR, Inc. occupies  approximately 3,344 square feet
of office  space in the building  located at 710  Lakeshore  Circle.  The annual
rental rate is $40,800.  The fourth approval was the ratification of the current
arrangement   related   to  the   payment  of  fees  for  the   services   of  a
programmer/analyst  that was employed by LOR,  Inc.  but has become  employed by
Rollins, Inc. in the first quarter of 2003. The programmer/analyst is being used
to further  develop  the  PowerTrak  Version  1.0  hand-held  computer  software
purchased in the fourth  quarter of 2002 (as discussed in the above  paragraph).
The hourly wage paid to LOR, Inc. was $32 per hour, which equated to $66,560 per
year,  including  overhead.  In the opinion of  Management,  these related party
transactions  were  reasonable  and  fair to the  Company  and  will  not have a
material effect on the Company's  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity.

     At the  Company's  October  28,  2003  Board  of  Directors'  meeting,  the
independent directors of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee approved
an amendment  to the  arrangements  with LOR,  Inc.  regarding  the usage of the
aircrafts,  as  discussed  above,  to  provide  that they would  substitute  the
Gulfstream  III  N330WR  for the  Jetstar  II,  that was  sold,  with all  other
provisions  remaining the same except that the  Gulfstream III N330WR is charged
at a rate of  $12,745  per  month.  The  decision  was based on full  disclosure
including  independent  appraisals.  In the opinion of Management,  this related
party  transaction  was  reasonable  and fair to the Company and will not have a
material effect on the Company's  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity.

     Employees  of Rollins,  Inc.  confer with  employees  of LOR,  Inc. and RRR
Associates and vice versa.  No fees are charged for these services  because,  in
the opinion of Management, the activity is mutually beneficial and offsetting.

Critical Accounting Policies

     We view  critical  accounting  policies to be those  policies that are very
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations,
and that require Management's most difficult,  complex or subjective  judgments.
The circumstances  that make these judgments  difficult or complex relate to the
need for  Management  to make  estimates  about the effect of  matters  that are
inherently  uncertain.  We believe  our  critical  accounting  policies to be as
follows:

     Accrual  for  Termite  Contracts  - The  Company  maintains  an accrual for
     termite  contracts  representing  the  estimated  costs of  reapplications,
     repair  claims,  associated  labor and chemicals,  settlements,  awards and
     other costs relative to termite  control  services  performed  prior to the
     balance  sheet  date.  The Company  contracts  an  independent  third party
     actuary  on an annual  basis to provide  the  Company  an  estimate  of the
     liability based


     upon historical claims  information for the largest portion of the accrual.
     In addition,  Management  estimates and accrues for costs outside the scope
     of the  actuarial  study  including the  estimated  costs of  retreatments,
     representing costs to be incurred that are estimatable at the balance sheet
     date, as well as liability and costs  associated with claims in litigation.
     The actuarial study and historical  experience are major  considerations in
     determining  the accrual  balance,  along with  Management's  knowledge  of
     changes in  business  practices,  contract  changes,  ongoing  claims,  and
     termite  remediation  trends. The accrual is established based on all these
     factors.  Management makes judgments  utilizing these operational and other
     factors  but  recognizes  that they are  inherently  subjective  due to the
     difficulty in  predicting  settlements  and awards.  Other factors that may
     impact  future  cost  include   chemical  life  expectancy  and  government
     regulation.  It is  significant  that  the  actual  number  of  claims  has
     decreased  in  recent  years  due  to  changes  in the  Company's  business
     practices.  However,  it is  not  possible  to  accurately  predict  future
     significant  claims.  Positive  changes to our business  practices  include
     revisions made to our  contracts,  more  effective  treatment  methods that
     include a directed-liquid baiting program, more effective termiticides, and
     expanded training methods and techniques.

     Accrued  Insurance  - The Company  self-insures,  up to  specified  limits,
     certain  risks  related to general  liability,  workers'  compensation  and
     vehicle liability.  The estimated costs of existing and future claims under
     the  self-insurance  program are accrued  based upon  historical  trends as
     incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement
     of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently
     revised  based  on  developments  relating  to  such  claims.  The  Company
     contracts an independent  third party actuary on an annual basis to provide
     the  Company  an  estimated   liability   based  upon   historical   claims
     information.  The  actuarial  study is a major  consideration,  along  with
     Management's knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims
     compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these
     factors.  Management's  judgment is inherently  subjective  and a number of
     factors are  outside  Management's  knowledge  and  control.  Additionally,
     historical  information  is not  always an  accurate  indication  of future
     events.  It should be noted that the  number of claims has been  decreasing
     due to the  Company's  proactive  risk  management  to develop and maintain
     ongoing programs.  However, it is not possible to accurately predict future
     significant   claims.   Initiatives  that  have  been  implemented  include
     pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all
     its drivers, utilization of a Global Positioning System that has been fully
     deployed to our Company vehicles,  post-offer  physicals for new employees,
     and  pre-hire,  random and  post-accident  drug  testing.  The  Company has
     improved  the time  required  to report a claim by  utilizing a "Red Alert"
     program that provides serious accident  assessment  twenty four hours a day
     and seven days a week and has  instituted  a  modified  duty  program  that
     enables employees to go back to work on a limited-duty basis.

     Revenue  Recognition  - The  Company's  revenue  recognition  policies  are
     designed to  recognize  revenues at the time  services are  performed.  For
     certain revenue types,  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of
     cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates
     are  utilized.   Residential  and  commercial  pest  control  services  are
     primarily  recurring  in nature on a monthly  or  bi-monthly  basis,  while
     certain  types of  commercial  customers  may receive  multiple  treatments
     within a given month.  In general,  pest control  customers sign an initial
     one-year  contract,  and revenues are  recognized  at the time services are
     performed.  For pest control  customers,  the Company offers a discount for
     those customers who prepay for a full year of services.  The Company defers
     recognition  of these advance  payments and  recognizes  the revenue as the
     services are rendered.  The Company classifies the discounts related to the
     advance  payments as a reduction in revenues.  Termite baiting revenues are
     recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting.  At
     the  inception of a new baiting  services  contract  upon  quality  control
     review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery
     of the monitoring stations,  initial directed liquid termiticide  treatment
     and  installation  of the monitoring  services.  The amount deferred is the
     fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service.
     The  amount  deferred  for  the  undelivered  monitoring  element  is  then
     recognized as income on a straight-line  basis over the remaining  contract
     term,   which  results  in   recognition  of  revenue  in  a  pattern  that
     approximates the timing of performing  monitoring  visits.  Baiting renewal
     revenue is deferred and  recognized  over the annual  contract  period on a
     straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required
     monitoring visits. Traditional termite treatments are recognized as revenue
     at the time services are performed.  Traditional  termite contract renewals
     are  recognized  as  revenues  at the  renewal  date in order to match  the
     revenue with the approximate timing of the corresponding  service provided.
     Interest  income on  installment  receivables  is accrued  monthly based on
     actual loan balances and stated interest rates.  Franchise fees are treated
     as unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial Position for the duration
     of the initial contract period. Royalties from Orkin franchises are


     accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly  basis.  Gains on
     sales of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at the
     time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.

     Contingency  Accruals - The  Company is a party to legal  proceedings  with
     respect to matters in the ordinary  course of business.  In accordance with
     Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  5,  Accounting  for
     Contingencies,  the Company  estimates  and accrues for its  liability  and
     costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined
     in  consultation  with outside  counsel.  It is not possible to  accurately
     predict the ultimate result of the litigation.  However,  in the opinion of
     Management,  the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse
     impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Flow

     The Company  believes  its current  cash  balances,  future cash flows from
operating  activities and available  borrowings  under its $55.0 million line of
credit will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and
fund  expansion  of the  business  for the  foreseeable  future.  The  Company's
operations generated cash of $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
compared with cash provided by operating activities of $53.7 million in 2002 and
$29.6 million in 2001. The 2003 results were achieved  primarily from higher Net
Income and strong  advance  payments  received from  customers.  The decrease in
Long-Term  Accrued  Liabilities  in 2003  was due to a $5.0  million  and a $9.8
million  contribution to the defined  benefit  retirement plan made in April and
December of 2003, respectively.

     The Company invested  approximately  $10.6 million in capital  expenditures
during the year ended  December  31,  2003.  Capital  expenditures  for the year
consisted  primarily of equipment  replacements and upgrades and improvements to
the Company's  management  information  systems.  The Company  expects to invest
between $10.0 million and $12.0 million in 2004 in capital expenditures.  During
the year, the Company made several  acquisitions  totaling $1.5 million compared
to $1.8 million during 2002. The Company  continues to seek new acquisitions and
will give consideration to any unusually  attractive  acquisition  opportunities
presented. A total of $9.0 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.05 per share a
quarter) during the year, compared to $6.0 million or $0.033 per share a quarter
during 2002.  The Company did not  repurchase any shares of Common Stock in 2003
and there remain 649,684 shares authorized to be repurchased. At the January 27,
2004  Board of  Directors'  Meeting  the Board  approved a 20%  increase  in the
quarterly  dividend,  from  $0.05 to $0.06  per  share to  holders  of record on
February 10, 2004 payable March 10, 2004. The Company has increased the dividend
for the second consecutive year. The capital expenditures,  acquisitions,  stock
repurchases  and cash  dividends  were funded  entirely  through  existing  cash
balances and operating activities.  The Company maintains a $55.0 million credit
facility  with a commercial  bank,  of which $32.0  million in Letters of Credit
were outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and February 27, 2004.

     On March 8, 2004,  the  Company  entered  into a  definitive  agreement  to
acquire,  through a purchase of assets,  the pest  control  business and certain
ancillary  operations  of  Western  Industries,  Inc.  and its  affiliates.  The
aggregate  consideration  will be paid in a combination  of cash and  marketable
securities,  on hand as well as borrowings  from an outside party to be arranged
in  connection  with the purchase,  and is expected to range from  approximately
$105.0 to


$110.0 million.  The amount to be financed has not been determined at this time.
The Company is  anticipating  closing on the  purchase in the second  quarter of
2004.

     Orkin, one of the Company's subsidiaries, is aggressively defending a class
action lawsuit filed in  Hillsborough  County,  Tampa,  Florida.  In early April
2002, the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County certified the class action status
of Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc. et al. Orkin is also a
defendant in Helen Cutler and Mary Lewin v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et
al pending in the District  Court of Houston  County,  Alabama.  Other  lawsuits
against  Orkin,  and in some  instances the Company,  are also being  vigorously
defended,  including the Warren,  Allen,  Petsch, and Stevens cases. For further
discussion,  see Note 7 to the accompanying financial statements.

     The Company  made a required  contribution  of $5.0 million and a voluntary
contribution of $9.8 million to its defined benefit retirement plan (the "Plan")
during 2003 as a result of the Plan's  funding  status.  Upon  evaluation of the
plan as of December  31, 2003,  it was  determined  that the plan's  accumulated
benefit  obligation  was funded and therefore the  previously  recorded  minimum
pension  liabilities  were  reversed.  The  Company  believes  that it will make
contributions  in the amount of  approximately  $3.0 to $6.0 million in 2004. In
the  opinion  of  Management,  additional  Plan  contributions  will  not have a
material effect on the Company's  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity.

     The decline in the Accrual for Termite  Contracts  of $2.6 million or 5.5%
reflects  improvement in the  experience  rate. The number of new termite claims
declined  for the fifth year in a row and was 10.9% lower than 2002,  which is a
result of improved treatment techniques,  more effective  termiticides,  shorter
term guarantees and quality assurance  initiatives.  Accrued Insurance decreased
$2.9  million or 6.9% during the year as a result of improved  experience  rate,
attributable  to the Company's  proactive  management of issues  associated with
self-insured risks.

Contractual Obligations

     The impact that the Company's  contractual  obligations  as of December 31,
2003 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as
follows:

(1)  Minimum pension funding  requirements are not included as such amounts have
     not  been  determined.  The  Company  estimates  that  it  will  contribute
     approximately $3.0 to $6.0 million to the plan in fiscal 2004.

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 00-21, Revenue
Arrangements  with  Multiple  Deliverables,   which  is  effective  for  revenue
arrangements  entered into in fiscal periods  beginning after June 15, 2003. The
Company adopted EITF 00-21 in the third quarter of 2003. This EITF addresses how
to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple
products,  services,  and/or rights to use assets. The Company's termite baiting
service involves multiple deliverables, consisting of an initial directed liquid
termiticide   treatment,   installation  of  termite  monitoring  stations,  and
subsequent periodic monitoring  inspections.  The portion of the termite baiting
service sales price applicable to subsequent  periodic  monitoring  inspections,
which is determined  based on fair value,  is deferred and  recognized  over the
first year of each  contract.  The portion of the sales price  applicable to the
termiticide  treatment and installation of the monitoring services is determined
under the  residual  method  (the total  sales  price less the fair value of the
monitoring   inspections).   Revenues   from  the   termiticide   treatment  and
installation of the termite monitoring  stations are recognized upon performance
of the  service  and  installation.  The  adoption  of this  EITF did not have a
significant effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.


     In December 2002, the FASB issued  Interpretation No. 46,  Consolidation of
Variable  Interest  Entities  ("FIN 46").  The  Interpretation  requires  that a
variable interest entity be consolidated by a company if that company is subject
to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities
or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's  residual returns or both. The
consolidation  requirements  of FIN 46 are effective  for all variable  interest
entities  created or acquired  after  January 31, 2003.  In December  2003,  the
Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued a revision to FIN 46 referred to as
Interpretation  No. 46 (R).  Among other  provisions,  the revision  extends the
adoption date of FIN 46 (R) to the first  quarter of 2004 for variable  interest
entities created prior to February 1, 2003. The Company believes the adoption of
the Interpretation,  with respect to variable interest entities created prior to
February  1, 2003 will not have a  material  impact on the  financial  position,
results of  operations  or liquidity of the  Company.  During 2003,  the Company
adopted FIN 46 with  respect to franchise  entities  created  after  January 31,
2003. The adoption did not have a significant effect on the Company's  financial
position  or results of  operations  (see Note 1 to the  accompanying  financial
statements).

Forward-Looking Statements

     This Annual Report contains  forward-looking  statements within the meaning
of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such  forward-looking
statements include statements  regarding the expected impact of potential future
pension  plan  contributions,   related  party  transactions,   the  outcome  of
litigation  arising in the  ordinary  course of business  and the outcome of the
Helen  Cutler  and Mary  Lewin  v.  Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc.  et al.
("Cutler") and the Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc. et al.
("Butland")   litigation  on  the  Company's  financial  position,   results  of
operations  and  liquidity;  the  adequacy of the  Company's  resources  to fund
operations and obligations;  the Company's projected 2004 capital  expenditures;
the impact of recent  accounting  pronouncements;  the  expected  outcome of the
growth of national  account  revenue;  and the impact of expected  pension  plan
contributions in the near future. The actual results of the Company could differ
materially from those  indicated by the  forward-looking  statements  because of
various risks,  timing and  uncertainties  including,  without  limitation,  the
possibility of an adverse  ruling against the Company in the Cutler,  Butland or
other litigation;  general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry
practices  or  technologies;  the  degree of success  of the  Company's  termite
process  reforms and pest control selling and treatment  methods;  the Company's
ability  to  identify  potential  acquisitions;   climate  and  weather  trends;
competitive  factors and pricing practices;  potential increases in labor costs;
and changes in various government laws and regulations,  including environmental
regulations. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability
of the Company to  control,  and in many cases the  Company  cannot  predict the
risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially
from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market Risk

     As of December 31, 2003,  the Company  maintained an  investment  portfolio
subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company has been affected
by the impact of lower  interest  rates on interest  income from its  short-term
investments.  The Company is also subject to interest rate risk exposure through
borrowings  on its $55.0  million  credit  facility.  Due to the absence of such
borrowings as of December 31, 2003, this risk was not significant in 2003 and is
not expected to have a material effect upon the Company's  results of operations
or  financial  position  going  forward.  However,  the  Company  does  maintain
approximately $32.0 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is also exposed to
market  risks  arising  from  changes in foreign  exchange  rates.  The  Company
believes that this foreign  exchange  rate risk will not have a material  effect
upon the Company's results of operations or financial position going forward.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business  Description  - Rollins,  Inc. (the  "Company")  is a national  service
company  with  headquarters  located in  Atlanta,  Georgia,  providing  pest and
termite control services to both residential and commercial customers.

     Orkin, Inc. ("Orkin"),  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company founded in
1901,  is one of the world's  largest  pest and termite  control  companies.  It
provides  customized  services  from over 400  locations  to  approximately  1.6
million  customers.  Orkin serves  customers in the United States,  Canada,  and
Mexico, providing essential pest control services and protection against termite
damage,  rodents and insects to homes and  businesses,  including  hotels,  food
service  establishments,   food  manufacturers,   retailers  and  transportation
companies.   Orkin  operates  under  the  Orkin(R)  and  PCO  Services,  Inc.(R)
trademarks and the AcuridSM service mark.

     The Company has only one reportable  segment,  its pest and termite control
business.  The Company's  results of operations and its financial  condition are
not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company's foreign
operations.

Principles of  Consolidation - In accordance with SFAS 94 and with Rule 3A-02(a)
of Regulation S-X, the Company's  policy is to consolidate all  subsidiaries and
investees  where  it  has  voting  control.   The  Company  does  not  have  any
subsidiaries  or investees where it has less than a 100% equity interest or less
than 100% voting  control,  nor does it have any  interest  in other  investees,
joint ventures, or other entities that require consolidation.

Estimates Used in the  Preparation of  Consolidated  Financial  Statements - The
preparation  of  the  consolidated   financial  statements  in  conformity  with
accounting   principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the  accompanying  notes and financial  statements.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Revenues - The Company's revenue recognition  policies are designed to recognize
revenues at the time services are performed.  For certain revenue types, because
of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing
services, certain accounting estimates are utilized.  Residential and commercial
pest  control  services  are  primarily  recurring  in nature  on a  monthly  or
bi-monthly  basis,  while  certain  types of  commercial  customers  may receive
multiple  treatments  within a given month. In general,  pest control  customers
sign an initial  one-year  contract,  and  revenues are  recognized  at the time
services  are  performed.  For pest  control  customers,  the  Company  offers a
discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company
defers  recognition of these advance  payments and recognizes the revenue as the
services are  rendered.  The Company  classifies  the  discounts  related to the
advance  payments as a reduction  in  revenues.  Termite  baiting  revenues  are
recognized based on the delivery of the individual  units of accounting.  At the
inception of a new baiting services  contract upon quality control review of the
installation,  the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring
stations,  initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the
monitoring  services.  The  amount  deferred  is the fair  value  of  monitoring
services to be rendered after the initial  service.  The amount deferred for the
undelivered  monitoring  element is then recognized as income on a straight-line
basis over the remaining  contract term, which results in recognition of revenue
in a pattern  that  approximates  the timing of  performing  monitoring  visits.
Baiting  renewal  revenue is deferred and  recognized  over the annual  contract
period on a straight-line  basis that  approximates the timing of performing the
required  monitoring  visits.  Traditional  termite treatments are recognized as
revenue  at the  time  services  are  performed.  Traditional  termite  contract
renewals  are  recognized  as revenues at the renewal date in order to match the
revenue  with the  approximate  timing of the  corresponding  service  provided.
Interest  income on installment  receivables is accrued  monthly based on actual
loan balances and stated interest rates.  Franchise fees are treated as unearned
revenue in the  Statement of Financial  Position for the duration of the initial
contract  period.  Royalties from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as
revenues as earned on a monthly basis.  Gains on sales of pest control  customer
accounts to franchises are recognized at the time of sale and when collection is
reasonably assured.

Advertising  -  Advertising  expenses  are charged to income  during the year in
which they are incurred.  The total advertising costs were  approximately  $31.9
million, $30.0 million and $30.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Cash and Short-Term  Investments - The Company  considers all investments with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Short-term investments
are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.


Marketable  Securities  - The Company  maintains  investments  held with several
large, well-capitalized financial institutions.  The Company's investment policy
does not allow investment in any securities  rated less than "investment  grade"
by national rating services.

Management  determines the appropriate  classification of debt securities at the
time of purchase and  re-evaluates  such  designations  as of each balance sheet
date. Debt securities are classified as  available-for-sale  because the Company
does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity.  Available-for-sale
securities  are  stated at their  fair  values,  with the  unrealized  gains and
losses,  net of tax, reported as a separate  component of stockholders'  equity.
Realized  gains  and  losses  and  declines  in value  judged  to be other  than
temporary on  available-for-sale  securities  are  included in interest  income.
Realized losses on sales of marketable  securities  totaled $24,900 for the year
ended  December 31, 2003.  The cost of securities  sold is based on the specific
identification  method.  Interest and  dividends  on  securities  classified  as
available-for-sale are included in interest income. As of December 31, 2003, the
fair value of marketable  securities  approximates $22.0 million and includes an
unrealized  loss of $108,787.  The  Company's  marketable  securities  generally
consist of United States  government,  corporate and municipal debt  securities.
All of the Company's  marketable  securities at December 31, 2003 mature in less
than twelve months.

Materials  and  Supplies - Materials  and  supplies are recorded at the lower of
cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Income  Taxes - The Company  provides  for income  taxes based on  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 109,  Accounting  for Income Taxes,
which  requires  recognition  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and assets for the
expected  future  tax  consequences  of events  that have been  included  in the
consolidated financial statements or tax returns.

Equipment  and Property -  Depreciation  and  amortization,  which  includes the
amortization of assets recorded under capital leases,  are provided  principally
on a straight-line  basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Annual  provisions for  depreciation of $13.6 million in 2003,  $15.0 million in
2002 and  $13.6  million  in  2001,  have  been  reflected  in the  Consolidated
Statements of Income in the line item entitled  Depreciation  and  Amortization.
These annual  provisions for depreciation are computed using the following asset
lives:  buildings,  ten to forty years; and furniture,  fixtures,  and operating
equipment,  three to ten years.  Expenditures for additions,  major renewals and
betterments  are capitalized  and  expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred.  The cost of assets  retired or otherwise  disposed of and
the related  accumulated  depreciation  and amortization are eliminated from the
accounts in the year of disposal  with the  resulting  gain or loss  credited or
charged to income.

Insurance - The Company  self-insures,  up to specified  limits,  certain  risks
related to general liability,  workers' compensation and vehicle liability.  The
estimated costs of existing and future claims under the  self-insurance  program
are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or
unreported  (although  actual  settlement  of the  claims  may not be made until
future periods) and may be subsequently  revised based on developments  relating
to such claims.  The Company  contracts an independent third party actuary on an
annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical
claims  information.  The actuarial study is a major  consideration,  along with
Management's  knowledge  of changes in business  practice  and  existing  claims
compared  to current  balances.  The reserve is  established  based on all these
factors.  Management's judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors
are  outside  Management's  knowledge  and  control.  Additionally,   historical
information is not always an accurate indication of future events.

Accrual for Termite  Contracts  - The Company  maintains  an accrual for termite
contracts  representing  the estimated costs of  reapplications,  repair claims,
associated labor and chemicals,  settlements, awards and other costs relative to
termite control services  performed prior to the balance sheet date. The Company
contracts an  independent  third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the
Company an estimate of the liability  based upon historical  claims  information
for the largest portion of the accrual.  In addition,  Management  estimates and
accrues  for  costs  outside  the scope of the  actuarial  study  including  the
estimated  costs of  retreatments,  representing  costs to be incurred  that are
estimatable at the balance sheet date, as well as liability and costs associated
with claims in litigation.  The actuarial  study and  historical  experience are
major considerations in determining the accrual balance, along with Management's
knowledge of changes in business  practices,  contract changes,  ongoing claims,
and termite  remediation  trends.  The accrual is established based on all these
factors.  Management  makes  judgments  utilizing  these  operational  and other
factors but recognizes that they are inherently subjective due to the difficulty
in predicting  settlements and awards. Other factors that may impact future cost
include  chemical life expectancy and government  regulation.  It is significant
that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes


in the Company's business  practices.  However, it is not possible to accurately
predict future  significant  claims.  Positive changes to our business practices
include revisions made to our contracts,  more effective  treatment methods that
include a  directed-liquid  baiting program,  more effective  termiticides,  and
expanded training methods and techniques.

Contingency  Accruals - The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect
to matters in the ordinary  course of business.  In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies,  the Company
estimates  and  accrues  for  its  liability  and  costs   associated  with  the
litigation.  Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation  with outside
counsel.  It is not possible to  accurately  predict the ultimate  result of the
litigation. However, in the opinion of Management, the outcome of the litigation
will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's  financial condition or
results of operations.

Earnings  Per  Share - In  accordance  with  SFAS No.  128,  Earnings  Per Share
("EPS"),  the Company  presents basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed
on the basis of weighted-average shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS is computed on
the basis of  weighted-average  shares  outstanding  plus common  stock  options
outstanding  during the year, which, if exercised,  would have a dilutive effect
on EPS.  Basic  and  diluted  EPS in 2002 and 2001 have  been  restated  for the
three-for-two  stock split in March of 2003. A  reconciliation  of the number of
weighted-average shares used in computing basic and diluted EPS is as follows:


Stock-Based  Compensation  - As  permitted  by  SFAS  No.  123,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation,  the Company accounts for employee stock compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion  No.  25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees.  No  stock-based
employee  compensation  cost is reflected in net income,  as all options granted
under  those  plans  had an  exercise  price  equal to the  market  value of the
underlying  common stock on the date of grant.  The following table  illustrates
the effect on net income and  earnings  per share if the Company had applied the
fair value  recognition  provisions of FASB  Statement No. 123,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.



     The per share  weighted-average  fair value of stock options granted during
2003, 2002, and 2001 was $4.05, $2.53, and $3.57,  respectively,  on the date of
grant,  using  the  Black-Scholes   option-pricing   model  with  the  following
weighted-average assumptions:


                                         2003            2002            2001

Comprehensive  Income (Loss) - Other  Comprehensive  Income (Loss)  results from
foreign  currency  translations,   minimum  pension  liability  adjustments  and
unrealized loss on marketable securities.

New  Accounting  Standards - In November  2002,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force
issued EITF 00-21,  Revenue  Arrangements with Multiple  Deliverables,  which is
effective  for revenue  arrangements  entered into in fiscal  periods  beginning
after June 15,  2003.  The Company  adopted  EITF 00-21 in the third  quarter of
2003.  This EITF  addresses  how to account for  arrangements  that  involve the
delivery or performance  of multiple  products,  services,  and/or rights to use
assets.  The Company's termite baiting service involves  multiple  deliverables,
consisting of an initial directed liquid termiticide treatment,  installation of
termite monitoring stations, and subsequent periodic monitoring inspections. The
portion of the termite  baiting  service  sales price  applicable  to subsequent
periodic  monitoring  inspections,  which is determined  based on fair value, is
deferred and recognized over the first year of each contract. The portion of the
sales price  applicable to the  termiticide  treatment and  installation  of the
monitoring  services is  determined  under the residual  method (the total sales
price  less the fair value of the  monitoring  inspections).  Revenues  from the
termiticide  treatment and installation of the termite  monitoring  stations are
recognized  upon  performance of the service and  installation.  The adoption of
this EITF did not have a significant effect on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued  Interpretation No. 46,  Consolidation of
Variable  Interest  Entities  ("FIN 46").  The  Interpretation  requires  that a
variable interest entity be consolidated by a company if that company is subject
to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities
or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's  residual returns or both. The
consolidation  requirements  of FIN 46 are effective  for all variable  interest
entities  created or acquired  after  January 31, 2003.  In December  2003,  the
Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued a revision to FIN 46 referred to as
Interpretation  No. 46 (R).  Among other  provisions,  the revision  extends the
adoption date of FIN 46 (R) to the first  quarter of 2004 for variable  interest
entities created prior to February 1, 2003. The Company believes the adoption of
the Interpretation,  with respect to variable interest entities created prior to
February 1, 2003,  will not have a material  impact on the  financial  position,
results of  operations  or liquidity of the


Company.  During  2003,  the Company  adopted FIN 46 with  respect to  franchise
entities created after January 31, 2003. The adoption did not have a significant
effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Franchising Program - Orkin has 44 franchises as of December 31, 2003, including
international franchises in Mexico, established in 2000, and Panama, established
in 2003.  Transactions  with franchises  involve sales of customer  contracts to
establish new  franchises,  initial  franchise fees and royalties.  The customer
contracts and initial  franchise  fees are typically  sold for a combination  of
cash and notes due over periods  ranging up to 5 years.  As of December 31, 2003
and 2002,  notes  receivable  from  franchises  aggregated $3.9 million and $2.6
million,  respectively.  The Company  recognizes gains from the sale of customer
contracts at the time they are sold to franchises and collection on the notes is
reasonable  assured,  which amounted to approximately $2.2 million in 2003, $1.1
million in 2002,  and $0.3 million in 2001,  and are included as revenues in the
accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of Income.  Initial  franchise  fees are
deferred  for the  duration of the initial  contract  period and are included as
unearned revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  Deferred
franchise  fees  amounted to $1.4  million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively.  Royalties from franchises are accrued and recognized as
revenues as earned on a monthly basis. Revenues from royalties were $1.4 million
in 2003,  $1.2 million in 2002, and $0.9 million in 2001. The Company's  maximum
exposure to loss  relating to the  franchises  aggregate  $2.5  million and $1.5
million in December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Fair  Value of  Financial  Instruments  - The  Company's  financial  instruments
consist of cash, short-term investments,  marketable securities, trade and notes
receivables,  accounts  payable and other short-term  liabilities.  The carrying
amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values.

Reclassifications - Certain amounts for previous years have been reclassified to
conform with the 2003 consolidated financial statement presentation.

Three-for-Two Stock Split - The Board of Directors,  at its quarterly meeting on
January 28,  2003,  authorized  a  three-for-two  stock split by the issuance on
March 10, 2003 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of
record at  February  10,  2003.  All share and per share  data for 2002 and 2001
appearing in the consolidated  financial  statements and related notes have been
retroactively adjusted for this stock split.

2.   TRADE RECEIVABLES
     Trade receivables, net, at December 31, 2003, totaling $48.5 million and at
December 31, 2002,  totaling $48.7  million,  are net of allowances for doubtful
accounts  of $4.6  million and $5.4  million,  respectively.  Trade  receivables
include  installment  receivable  amounts,  which are due subsequent to one year
from the balance sheet dates.  These amounts were approximately $6.2 million and
$6.4 million at the end of 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  Trade receivables also
include notes  receivable due from  franchises  which amount to $3.9 million and
$2.6 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The carrying amount
of notes receivable  approximates  fair value as the interest rates  approximate
market  rates.  The Allowance For Doubtful  Accounts is  principally  calculated
based on the  application  of estimated loss  percentages  to delinquency  aging
totals,  based on contractual  terms, for the various categories of receivables.
Bad debt  write-offs  occur  according to company  policies that are specific to
pest control,  commercial and termite  accounts.  At any given time, the Company
may have  immaterial  amounts due from related  parties,  which are invoiced and
settled on a regular basis. Receivables due from related parties were $55,000 as
of December 31, 2003, as compared to $64,000 as of December 31, 2002.

3.   EQUIPMENT AND PROPERTY
     Equipment and property are presented at cost less accumulated  depreciation
and are detailed as follows:

4.   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
     Intangibles  consist primarily of goodwill and customer  contracts and also
includes  trademarks  and  non-compete  agreements,  all  related to  businesses
acquired.  Goodwill  represents  the excess of the purchase  price over the fair
value of net assets of businesses acquired.  The carrying amount of goodwill was
$72.5 million as of December 31, 2003 and $72.4 million as of December 31, 2002.
Goodwill  arising  from  acquisitions  prior to  November  1970 has  never  been
amortized for financial statement purposes, since, in the opinion of Management,
there has been no decrease  in the value of the  acquired  businesses.  Prior to
2002,  the values  assigned to all  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill for
acquisitions  completed  subsequent to November 1970 and prior to June 30, 2001,
were amortized on a straight-line  basis over the estimated  useful lives of the
assets, not exceeding 40 years.

     On January 1, 2002, the Company  adopted FASB  Statement No. 142,  Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. As of January 1, 2002, amortization of goodwill and
trademarks  was  terminated,  and  instead  the assets are  subject to  periodic
testing for impairment.  The Company completed its annual impairment analyses as
of September 30, 2003. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has
concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or trademarks has occurred.

     Customer   contracts  and   non-compete   agreements  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis over the period of the agreements,  as  straight-line  best
approximates  the ratio that current  revenues  bear to the total of current and
anticipated revenues,  based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance
with  Statement 142, the expected  lives of customer  contracts and  non-compete
agreements were reviewed,  and it was determined that customer  contracts should
be amortized over a life of 8 to 12 1/2 years  dependent upon customer type. The
impact  of this  review  in 2002 was an  increase  in  amortization  expense  on
customer  contracts  of  $2.0  million.  The  carrying  amount  and  accumulated
amortization for customer contracts are as follows:

                                                                December 31,

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Had the Company  adopted the  provisions of Statement 142 as of January 1, 2001,
the effects on net income would have been as follows:


Total intangible  amortization  expense was approximately  $6.9 million in 2003,
$6.7  million  in 2002  and  $6.6  million  in 2001.  Amortization  of  customer
contracts and non-competes was approximately  $6.9 million in 2003, $6.7 million
in 2002 and $4.4 million in 2001 and goodwill  amortization  was $2.2 million in
2001.  Estimated  amortization  expense for each of the five  succeeding  fiscal
years is as follows:

              2008                                       5,101


5.   INCOME TAXES
     The Company's income tax provision consisted of the following:

     The primary  factors  causing  income tax expense to be different  than the
federal statutory rate for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are as follows:



     The Provision  for Income Taxes  resulted in an effective tax rate of 40.4%
on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003. For 2002 and
2001,  the effective tax rate was 38.0%.  The effective  income tax rate differs
from the  annual  federal  statutory  tax rate  primarily  because  of state and
foreign income taxes.  During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid income taxes
of $20.2 million, $10.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively, net of refunds.

     Deferred  income  taxes  reflect  the  net  tax  effects  of the  temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting  purposes  and  income tax  purposes.  Significant  components  of the
Company's  deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003 and 2002 are
as follows:

                                                                December 31,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Total rental expense under operating leases charged to operations was $28.0
million,  $27.4 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

     The  Company  maintains  a credit  facility  with a bank that  allows it to
borrow up to $55.0  million on an  unsecured  basis at the bank's  prime rate of
interest or the indexed London Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR) under which $32.0
million  in  Letters  of Credit  were  outstanding  at  December  31,  2003.  No
borrowings were outstanding  under this credit facility as of December 31, 2003,
2002 or 2001.

     Orkin,  one of the Company's  subsidiaries,  is a named  defendant in Helen
Cutler and Mary Lewin v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al. pending in the
District Court of Houston County, Alabama. The plaintiffs in the above mentioned
case filed suit in March of 1996 and are seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief  for  alleged  breach  of  contract  arising  out of  alleged  missed  or
inadequate reinspections. The attorneys for the plaintiffs contend that the case
is suitable for a class action and the court has ruled that the plaintiffs would
be permitted to pursue a class action lawsuit against Orkin. Orkin believes this
case to be without merit and intends to defend itself  vigorously at trial.  The
trial is currently set for early June 2004.  At this time,  the final outcome of
the litigation cannot be determined.  However, in the opinion of Management, the
ultimate  resolution of this action will not have a material  adverse  effect on
the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     Orkin is also a named  defendant  in Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating
Company, Inc. et al. pending in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Tampa,
Florida.  The  plaintiffs  filed suit in March of 1999 and are seeking  monetary
damages and injunctive relief.  The Court ruled in early April 2002,  certifying
the class  action  lawsuit  against  Orkin.  Orkin  appealed  this ruling to the
Florida  Second  District  Court of Appeals which  remanded the case back to the
trial court for further  findings.  Orkin believes this case to be without merit
and intends to defend itself  vigorously  through trial,  if necessary.  At this
time, the final outcome of the litigation cannot be determined.  However, in the
opinion of  Management,  the ultimate  resolution of this action will not have a
material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  financial  position,  results  of
operations or liquidity.


     Orkin is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the
normal course of business. In the opinion of Management, the Company's liability
under any of these matters would not materially  affect its financial  condition
or results of operations.

     Additionally,  in the normal course of business,  Orkin is a defendant in a
number of lawsuits,  which allege that  plaintiffs have been damaged as a result
of the rendering of services by Orkin personnel and equipment. Orkin is actively
contesting  these  actions.  Some lawsuits have been filed (Ernest W. Warren and
Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc., et al.; Elizabeth
Allen and William Allen et al. v. Rollins, Inc. and Orkin Exterminating Company,
Inc.; Francis D. Petsch, et al. v. Orkin Exterminating Company, Inc. et al.; and
Bob J. Stevens v. Orkin Exterminating  Company, Inc. and Rollins, Inc.) in which
the  Plaintiffs are seeking  certification  of a class.  The cases  originate in
Georgia,  Florida,  and Texas. The Company believes them to be without merit and
intends to vigorously contest  certification and defend itself through trial, if
necessary.  In the opinion of Management,  the outcome of these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial  position,  results of
operations or liquidity.

8.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
     The  Company  maintains a  noncontributory  tax-qualified  defined  benefit
retirement plan (the "Plan") covering  employees meeting certain age and service
requirements.  The Plan provides benefits based on the average  compensation for
the  highest  five  years  during  the last ten years of  credited  service  (as
defined) in which compensation was received,  and the average anticipated Social
Security covered earnings.  The Company funds the Plan with at least the minimum
amount required by ERISA. The Company made contributions of $14.8 million to the
Plan in 2003.  Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted  amendments to the
Plan  including  a  change  to  the  benefit   calculation   and  limiting  plan
participation to current participants. These amendments are reflected in benefit
obligations below.

     The  funded  status  of the  Plan  and the  net  amount  recognized  in the
statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of December 31:

     The accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plan was
$115,653 and $99,483 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Rollins, Inc.
uses a December 31 measurement date for its Qualified Plan.


     Increases  (decreases) in the minimum pension  liability which were charged
(credited)  to other  comprehensive  income (loss) were $26.1  million,  ($19.9)
million and ($6.2) million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     The  weighted-average  assumptions as of December 31 were used to determine
the projected benefit obligation and net benefit cost:

                                                             2003         2002

     The return on plan assets  reflects  the  weighted-average  of the expected
long-term  rates of return for the broad  categories of investments  held in the
plan.  The  expected  long-term  rate of  return  is  adjusted  when  there  are
fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.

     The  components  of net periodic  benefit cost for the past three years are
summarized as follows:



     At December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the Plan's assets were  comprised of listed
common  stocks and U.S.  government  and corporate  securities.  Included in the
assets of the Plan were shares of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock with a market value
of $10.2 million and $7.7 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     The Plan's weighted  average asset allocation at December 31, 2003 and 2002
by asset category, along with the target allocation for 2004, are as follows:

     Our  investment  strategy for our pension plan is to maximize the long-term
rate of return on plan  assets  within an  acceptable  level of risk in order to
minimize  the  cost  of  providing  pension  benefits.   The  investment  policy
establishes  a target  allocation  for each asset class,  which is rebalanced as
required.  The  plan  utilizes  a number  of  investment  approaches,  including
individual  market  securities,  equity  and  fixed  income  funds in which  the


underlying  securities  are  marketable,  and debt funds to achieve  this target
allocation.  The  Company  expects  to  contribute  $3.0 to $6.0  million to the
pension plan in 2004.

     The Company sponsors a deferred  compensation 401(k) plan that is available
to substantially all employees with six months of service. The plan provides for
a matching  contribution  (made in the form of Common  Stock of the  Company) of
thirty cents ($.30) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions
to the plan  that do not  exceed 6  percent  of his or her  annual  compensation
(which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). The Company match percentage
remained  the same in 2003.  The charges to expense  for the Company  match were
approximately  $2.3  million in 2003,  $2.3  million in 2002 and $2.0 million in
2001. At December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001  approximately,  26.6%, 22.9% and 17%,
respectively of the plan assets consisted of Rollins,  Inc. Common Stock.  Total
administrative  fees for the plan were approximately  $265,000 in 2003, $278,500
in 2002 and $308,000 in 2001.

     The Company has one Employee Stock  Incentive  Plan,  adopted in April 1998
(the "1998 Plan") as a supplement to the 1994 Plan. An aggregate of 2.25 million
shares of Common Stock may be granted  under various  stock  incentive  programs
pursuant  to this  plan,  at a price  not  less  than  the  market  value of the
underlying stock on the date of grant. Options may be issued under the 1998 Plan
through  April 2008.  The majority of options  expire ten years from the date of
grant, if not exercised, and vest 20% each year over 5 years.

     Options are also  outstanding  under prior Employee Stock  Incentive  Plans
(the "1984 Plan" and the "1994 Plan"). Under these plans, 4.05 million shares of
Common Stock were subject to options  granted during the ten-year  periods ended
October  1994 and January  2004,  respectively.  The options were granted at the
fair  market  value of the shares on the date of grant and expire ten years from
the date of grant, if not exercised. No additional options will be granted under
the 1984 Plan and 1994 Plan.

     Option transactions during the last three years for the 1984, 1994 and 1998
plans are summarized as follows:

     10. RELATED PARTY  TRANSACTIONS At the Company's  October 22, 2002 Board of
Directors' meeting, the independent  directors of the Board of Directors and the
Audit Committee approved three related party  transactions.  The Audit Committee
and the  independent  directors  were  furnished  with  full  disclosure  of the
transactions, including independent appraisals, and determined that the terms of
each transaction were reasonable and fair to the Company. The first approval was
the purchase of the Rollins Training Center on October 31, 2002 for $3.1 million
from RTC, LLC, a company controlled by R. Randall Rollins, Chairman of the Board
of Rollins,  Inc. The second  approval  was the  purchase of hand-held  computer
software  development  known as  PowerTrak  Version 1.0 from RRR  Associates,  a
company


controlled  by R.  Randall  Rollins.  The  purchase  was made  during the fourth
quarter of 2002 at an approved  purchase  price of $250,000.  The third approval
was a lease  agreement  effective  July 1, 2002 that  expires  June 30, 2007 for
company real estate in Okeechobee County, Florida to be leased to Rollins Ranch,
a division of LOR, Inc., a company  controlled by R. Randall Rollins and Gary W.
Rollins,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  President and Chief  Operating  Officer of
Rollins,  Inc.  The annual  lease rate on this real estate is  $131,939.  In the
opinion of Management, these related party transactions were reasonable and fair
to the Company and will not have a material  effect on the  Company's  financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

     At the  Company's  January  28,  2003  Board  of  Directors'  meeting,  the
independent directors of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee approved
four  related  party  transactions.  The  Audit  Committee  and the  independent
directors  were furnished with full  disclosure of the  transactions,  including
independent  appraisals,  and determined that the terms of each transaction were
reasonable  and fair to the Company  and will not have a material  effect on the
Company's  financial  position,  results of operations  or liquidity.  The first
approval was the ratification of the current arrangement  between Rollins,  Inc.
and LOR, Inc., a company  controlled by R. Randall  Rollins and Gary W. Rollins,
related to sharing the aviation hangar located at the  Dekalb-Peachtree  Airport
as well as the usage of a JetStar II, owned by Rollins, Inc., and the Gulfstream
III N30WR,  owned by LOR,  Inc.  The  Jetstar II was sold by  Rollins,  Inc.  in
October 2003 and Rollins,  Inc.  purchased a Gulfstream III N330WR to replace it
in October 2003 (see discussion below). LOR, Inc. leases half of the hangar from
Rollins,  Inc. for a total annual lease amount of $14,873. This lease expires on
January 24, 2008. The hangar currently houses three airplanes,  two of which are
not owned by Rollins,  Inc.  and reside on the  portion of the hangar  leased by
LOR, Inc. All other  expenses  related to the hangar are also shared  equally by
Rollins, Inc. and LOR, Inc. Total expenses for 2003 were approximately $116,000,
which  includes  rental,  utilities,   maintenance  and  repairs,  depreciation,
property tax and miscellaneous  expense.  Pursuant to this arrangement the usage
is billed on a monthly  basis.  The  Jetstar II was  charged at a rate of $5,250
before it was sold and the  Gulfstream  III's are  charged  at a rate of $12,745
each, per month. All expenses  related to each respective  aircraft are paid for
by the owner of each  aircraft,  except for fuel.  Fuel is paid for by  Rollins,
Inc. and billed  monthly to the company using the aircraft.  Additionally,  when
Mr. R. Randall Rollins and Mr. Gary W. Rollins used the JetStar II, prior to its
sale, or use the Gulfstream III N330WR for personal use they are billed for such
use at the rate of $1,000 per hour, which  approximates the fuel cost. The total
hourly  usage for 2003 was  approximately  5.4 hours or $5,400.  The  Company on
occasion uses the  Gulfstream III N30WR and is also billed for its use at a rate
of $1,000 per hour,  which  approximates  the fuel cost. The second approval was
the  ratification  of the  arrangement  concerning the rental of office space to
LOR, Inc.  located at 2170  Piedmont  Road N.E.,  Atlanta,  Georgia  30324.  The
property located at 2170 Piedmont Road is owned by Rollins  Continental,  Inc. a
wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Rollins,   Inc.   Currently  LOR,  Inc.  occupies
approximately  360 square feet of office space in the  building  located at 2170
Piedmont  Road.  The annual  rental rate is $3,924.  The third  approval was the
ratification  of the  arrangement  concerning the rental of office space to LOR,
Inc.  located at 710 Lakeshore  Circle,  Atlanta,  Georgia  30324.  The property
located  at 710  Lakeshore  Circle is also owned by  Rollins  Continental,  Inc.
Currently LOR, Inc. occupies  approximately 3,344 square feet of office space in
the building located at 710 Lakeshore Circle. The annual rental rate is $40,800.
The fourth approval was the ratification of the current  arrangement  related to
the payment of fees for the services of a  programmer/analyst  that was employed
by LOR,  Inc. but has become  employed by Rollins,  Inc. in the first quarter of
2003.  The  programmer/analyst  is being used to further  develop the  PowerTrak
Version 1.0 hand-held  computer software purchased in the fourth quarter of 2002
(as discussed in the above paragraph). The hourly wage paid to LOR, Inc. was $32
per hour, which equated to $66,560 per year, including overhead.  In the opinion
of Management,  these related party transactions were reasonable and fair to the
Company and will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

     At the  Company's  October  28,  2003  Board  of  Directors'  meeting,  the
independent directors of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee approved
an amendment  to the  arrangements  with LOR,  Inc.  regarding  the usage of the
aircrafts,  as  discussed  above,  to  provide  that they would  substitute  the
Gulfstream  III  N330WR  for the  Jetstar  II,  that was  sold,  with all  other
provisions  remaining the same except that the  Gulfstream III N330WR is charged
at a rate of  $12,745  per  month.  The  decision  was based on full  disclosure
including  independent  appraisals.  In the opinion of Management,  this related
party  transaction  was  reasonable  and fair to the Company and will not have a
material effect on the Company's  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity.

     Employees  of Rollins,  Inc.  confer with  employees  of LOR,  Inc. and RRR
Associates and vice versa.  No fees are charged for these services  because,  in
the opinion of Management, the activity is mutually beneficial and offsetting.


11.  UNAUDITED QUARTERLY DATA
     All earnings per share data for the quarters prior to the second quarter of
2003 have been restated for the three-for-two stock split on March 10, 2003.


12.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (unaudited)
     On March 8, 2004,  the  Company  entered  into a  definitive  agreement  to
acquire,  through a purchase of assets,  the pest  control  business and certain
ancillary  operations  of  Western  Industries,  Inc.  and its  affiliates.  The
aggregate  consideration  will be paid in a combination  of cash and  marketable
securities,  on hand as well as borrowings  from an outside party to be arranged
in  connection  with the purchase,  and is expected to range from  approximately
$105.0 to $110.0  million.  The amount to be financed has not been determined at
this time.  The Company is  anticipating  closing on the  purchase in the second
quarter of 2004.

Item  9.  Changes  in and  Disagreements  with  Accountants  on  Accounting  and
Financial Disclosures.
     None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
     Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of our  Management,
including our principal  executive officer and principal  financial officer,  we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our
disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,  as of December 31, 2003.  Based on
this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded  that,  except as set forth in the  paragraph  below,  our  disclosure
controls  and  procedures  were  effective  such that the  material  information
required  to be included  in our  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")
reports is recorded, processed,  summarized and reported within the time periods
specified  in SEC rules and forms  relating  to  Rollins,  Inc.,  including  our
consolidated  subsidiaries,  and was made known to them by others  within  those
entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared.

     We have  identified  the following  significant  deficiency in our internal
control  framework:  There was a deficiency  with respect to the  accounting for
deferred income tax assets and liabilities, federal and state income tax payable
accounts and the provision for income taxes.


     The Company has  evaluated  the  deficiencies  and  established  additional
reconciliation  and review  policies and procedures to ensure proper  accounting
for all income tax activity. The Company has revised its reconciliation policies
and procedures to reconcile activity and prove cumulative temporary  differences
balances. Furthermore, the Company has established additional accounts to better
track income tax activity.

     The  deficiency  resulted in "true up"  adjustments  recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2003 of  approximately  $1.1 million,  as discussed in  "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations".  The
adjustments did not have a material impact on previously reported periods.

     In addition, there were no significant changes in our internal control over
financial  reporting  during the  quarter  ended  December  31,  2003 that could
significantly affect these controls.

               MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

     The  management  of Rollins,  Inc. is  responsible  for the  integrity  and
objectivity  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  other  financial
information  presented in this report.  These  statements  have been prepared in
conformity with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States
consistently  applied  and  include  amounts  based  on the best  estimates  and
judgments of management.

     Rollins  maintains a system of  internal  accounting  controls  designed to
provide reasonable assurance,  at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded
against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and
can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States. The internal control system
is augmented by written  policies and procedures,  an internal audit program and
the selection and training of qualified personnel. This system includes policies
that require  adherence to ethical  business  standards and compliance  with all
applicable laws and regulations.

     The consolidated  financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors,  and the
financial  statements  for the year ended December 31, 2001 have been audited by
other  auditors.  In  connection  with its  audit,  Ernst & Young  develops  and
maintains an  understanding  of Rollins'  accounting and financial  controls and
conducts tests of Rollin's accounting systems and other related procedures as it
considers necessary to render an opinion on the financial statements.

     The Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors,  composed solely of outside
directors,  meets periodically with Rollins'  management,  internal auditors and
independent  auditors to review  matters  relating  to the quality of  financial
reporting and internal accounting controls,  and the independent nature,  extent
and  results  of the  audit  effort.  The  Committee  recommends  to  the  Board
appointment  of the  independent  auditors.  Both the internal  auditors and the
independent  auditors  have access to the Audit  Committee,  with or without the
presence of management.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Rollins, Inc.

     We have  audited the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  financial
position of Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and
the related  consolidated  statements of income,  stockholders'  equity and cash
flows for the years then ended. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,  listed in the Index at
Item 15(a).  These financial  statements and schedule are the  responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial  statements  and  schedule  based  on  our  audits.  The  consolidated
financial statements and schedule of Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries for the year
ended  December  31,  2001  were  audited  by other  auditors  who  have  ceased
operations  and whose report dated  February 15, 2002  expressed an  unqualified
opinion on those  statements  and schedule  before the  restatement  adjustments
described in Notes 1, 4, 5 and 6.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the 2003 and 2002 financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Rollins,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  at  December  31,  2003  and  2002,  and  the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United
States.  Also, in our opinion,  the related financial statement schedule for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole,  presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

     As discussed above, the consolidated  financial  statements and schedule of
Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2001 were audited
by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 1, on January
28, 2003, the Company's board of directors  approved a 3-for-2 stock split,  and
all references to number of shares and per share information in the consolidated
financial  statements  have  been  adjusted  to  reflect  the  stock  split on a
retroactive  basis. We audited the adjustments  that were applied to restate the
number of shares and per share  information  reflected in the 2001  consolidated
financial statements. Our procedures included (a) agreeing the authorization for
the 3-for-2  stock  split to the  Company's  underlying  records  obtained  from
management,  and (b) testing the mathematical accuracy of the restated number of
shares,  earnings  per  share,  common  stock  stated  at par  value  and  other
applicable  disclosures such as stock options.  Also as discussed in Note 4, the
consolidated financial statements of Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries for the year
ended  December  31,  2001  have  been  revised  to  include  the   transitional
disclosures  required by Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 142,
Goodwill and Other  Intangibles,  which was adopted by the Company as of January
1, 2002.  Our audit  procedures  with respect to the  disclosures in Note 4 with
respect to 2001 included (a) agreeing the previously  reported net income to the
previously issued financial statements, (b) agreeing the adjustments to reported
net income representing amortization expense (including any related tax effects)
recognized  in  those  periods  related  to  goodwill  that is no  longer  being
amortized as a result of initially  applying  Statement No. 142  (including  any
related  tax  effects)  to  the  Company's   underlying  records  obtained  from
management,  (c) agreeing all 2001 separate asset and  accumulated  amortization
balances as disclosed for  individual  intangibles  to the Company's  underlying
accounting records obtained from management,  (d) agreeing all 2001 amortization
expense disclosures to the Company's underlying accounting records obtained from
management and (e) testing the mathematical  accuracy of the  reconciliation  of
pro forma net income to reported  net income.  Also as  discussed in Note 6, the
consolidated financial statements of Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries for the year
ended  December  31,  2001  have  been  revised  to  include  the   transitional
disclosures  required by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's  Accounting and
Disclosure   Requirements  for  Guarantees,   Including  Direct   Guarantees  of
Indebtedness  of Others,  which were  adopted by the Company as of December  31,
2002.  Our audit  procedures  with  respect  to the  disclosures  in Note 6 with
respect to 2001  included (a) agreeing the  previously  reported  beginning  and
ending  balances of the accrual for termite  contracts to the previously  issued
financial statements and (b) agreeing the provisions and settlements, claims and
expenditures made during the year to the Company's  underlying  records obtained
from  management.  The  disclosures  in  Note  5 of the  consolidated  financial
statements of Rollins,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  for the year ended  December 31,
2001 have been  revised  to  disclose


additional  detail with respect to the  components  of the  provision for income
taxes  and  certain  components  of  deferred  income  tax  amounts.  Our  audit
procedures  with  respect  to the  disclosures  in Note 5 with  respect  to 2001
included  agreeing the components of the provision for income taxes and deferred
tax amounts to the Company's underlying records obtained from management. In our
opinion, such adjustments and disclosures are appropriate and have been properly
applied.  However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures
to the 2001  consolidated  financial  statements  of the Company other than with
respect to such  adjustments and,  accordingly,  we do not express an opinion or
any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated  financial statements taken
as a whole.
