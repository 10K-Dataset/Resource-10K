1.	Business

General

Rollins,
Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting,
Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control
services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America, Australia, and Europe
with international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, Canada,
Australia, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

For
a listing of the Company’s Subsidiaries, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the Financial
Statements (Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K).

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable
assets for this segment, which includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle
East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico are included in Item 8 of this document, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” on pages 26  and 27. The Company’s results of operations and its financial
condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company’s foreign operations.

Three-for-Two
Stock Split

All
share and per share data presented have been adjusted to account for the three-for-two stock split effective December 10, 2018.

Common
Stock Repurchase Program

At
the July 24, 2012 Quarterly Board of Directors’ meeting, the Board authorized the purchase of 11.3 million shares of the
Company’s common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not repurchase shares on the
open market. In total, there are 7.6 million additional shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. The repurchase
program does not have an expiration date.

Backlog

Backlog
services and orders are usually provided within the month following the month of order receipt, except in the area of prepaid
pest control and bait monitoring services, which are usually provided within twelve months of order receipt. The Company does
not have a material portion of its business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the
election of a governmental entity.

Franchising
Programs

Orkin
Franchises

The
Company continues to expand its growth through Orkin’s franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets
where it is currently not economically feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are subject to a contractual
buyback provision at Orkin’s option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise.
International franchise agreements also contain an optional buyback provision; however, the franchisee has the prior right of
renewal of agreement. The Company, through its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary, began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in
1994, and established its first international franchise in 2000. It has since been expanded to Central America, South America,
the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico.

Critter
Control Franchises

The
Company expands its animal control growth through Critter Control’s franchise program. The Company has purchased several
Critter Control locations from its franchise owners while renaming and converting several Trutech locations to Critter Control.
The majority of Critter Control’s locations are franchised. Critter Control has franchises in the United States and two
in Canada as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Seasonality

The
business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase
in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined
by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the Company’s pest and
termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The
Company has relationships with a national pest control product distributor and other vendors for pest and termite control treatment
products. The Company maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing
needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers.

Competition

The
Company believes that Rollins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, Orkin Canada, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest
Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, Trutech, PermaTreat, Orkin Australia, Critter
Control, Safeguard Pest Control, Northwest Pest Control, OPC Services, and Aardwolf Pestkare competes favorably with competitors
as the world’s largest pest and termite control company. The Company’s competitors include Terminix, Ecolab, Rentokil
and Anticimex.

The
principal methods of competition in the Company’s pest and termite control markets are quality of service, customer proximity
and guarantee terms, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, and price.

Research
and Development

Expenditures
by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the
new and improved service methods and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies.
Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.

The
Company maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material
selection.

The
Company conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products. The Company also works closely with leading
scientists, educators, industry consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.

Environmental
and Regulatory Considerations

The
Company’s pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect
the environment, public health and consumers. Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Federal
Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”)

This
federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which
pest control companies operate. Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the
following: licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This allows
each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens’
wishes in each state. The pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food
Quality Protection Act of 1996 (“FQPA”)

The
FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts
its business.


Environmental
Remediation

The
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, is the primary
Federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible
parties. Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous
substances, and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will
work with the EPA and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation.
Consistent with the Company’s responsibilities under these regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments
and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As
these situations arise, the Company accrues management’s best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management’s
current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the Company’s financial condition
or operating results.

number of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2019 was approximately 14,000.

Item
1.A.    Risk Factors

Our
business depends on our strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands could hurt our ability to retain and expand
our base of customers.

Our
strong brands, Rollins, Orkin, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest Services, Northwest Pest Control, The Industrial Fumigant Company,
Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, Trutech, PermaTreat, Critter Control, Allpest, Safeguard Pest Control, Aardwolf Pestkare,
OPC Services, and other strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing
our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our
customers. Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues and product/technical
failures. Further, if our brands are significantly damaged, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially
and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and
continue to provide high-quality, pest control products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people’s
lives.

Economic
conditions may adversely affect our business.

Pest
and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers. As consumers restrict their discretionary
expenditures, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect
our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly
sensitive to adverse economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or
cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.

Expanding
into international markets presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations may not
be successful.

An
element of our strategy includes further expansion into international markets. Our ability to successfully operate in international
markets may be adversely affected by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and
legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption and currency laws and regulations, of the
countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in our existing and
future international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, difficulties
in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or
the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual
property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the
financial results of our international operations.


Our
inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our
ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our
ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees
is high, and the supply is very limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction
in our skilled labor force, increases in wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and
profitability could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

We
may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.

We
operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices, and
general economic issues. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies,
for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service
quality, and product availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe
that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent, we cannot assure investors that we will be able
to maintain our competitive position.

Our
operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.

In
the normal course of business, some of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations,
which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation,
either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position; however, it is
possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material
to the results of an individual year.

Our
operations could be affected if there is unauthorized access of personal, financial, or other data or information about our customers,
employees, third parties, or of Company’s proprietary of confidential information. We could be subject to interruption of
our business operations, private litigation, reputational damage and costly penalties.

Our
information technology systems, as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service
providers, can contain personal, financial, health, or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees.
Our information technology systems also contain Company’s and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ proprietary and other
confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and product development initiatives. We rely on, among
other things, commercially available vendors, cyber protection systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for
processing, transmission and storage of this information and data. The systems currently used for transmission and approval of
payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at
risk, meet standards set by the payment card industry (“PCI”). We continue to evaluate and modify our systems and
protocols for data security compliance purposes, and such standards may change from time to time. Activities by third parties,
advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments
may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our systems. Any compromises, breaches or errors in applications related
to our systems or failures to comply with applicable standards could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations,
including our customers’ ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our
services and products and could result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations, orders, industry standards or agreements
and subject us to costs, penalties and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. Also, a breach of data security could expose us to customer litigation and costs
related to the reporting and handling of such a breach.


Our
operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our
business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes
in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and
regulations, how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, or whether additional
laws and regulations will be adopted. We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state
environmental laws and regulations. We also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations
to date. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in
the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include
cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.

We
may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions
have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure investors that we will be able
to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure investors that
we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Any inability
on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

Our
operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

Our
operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide. The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal
nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis
of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically
resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods.
The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for
extended periods.

Our
franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could take actions that could harm our business.

Our
franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards
set forth in our agreements with them. Each franchising brand also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees,
subcontractors, and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control, and who own, operate and oversee the daily operations
of their businesses. As a result, the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do
not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely
affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed. This could adversely impact our business, financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. Similarly, if subcontractors, vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their
businesses in a manner consistent with required laws, standards and regulations, we could be subject to claims from regulators
or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third-party distributors, subcontractors, vendors and franchisees. In addition,
our relationship with our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could become strained (including resulting in litigation) as
we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required standards. These strains in our
relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations
and cash flows.

From
time to time, we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints, disputes or questions about our practices and
standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements. If franchisees or
groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us, we would vigorously defend against the claims in any
such proceeding. Our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely
impacted and the price of our common stock could decline.


Our
brand recognition could be impacted if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights
that are material to our business.

Our
ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual
property rights we own or license, particularly our registered brand names and service marks, Orkin

and others. We have not sought to register or protect every one of our marks either in the United States
or in every country in which they are or may be used. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and
other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would
in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand names, we could suffer a material adverse
impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation may be necessary to enforce
our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our
products, services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights.

The
Company’s management has a substantial ownership interest; public stockholders may have no effective voice in the Company’s
management.

The
Company has elected the “Controlled Company” exemption under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
Listed Company Manual. The Company is a “Controlled Company” because a group that includes the Company’s Chairman
of the Board, R. Randall Rollins, and his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and
a director of the Company, and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company’s
voting power. As a “Controlled Company,” the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.

Rollins,
Inc.’s executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly, or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the
aggregate, approximately 56 percent of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will
effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions
such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the
effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Our
management has a substantial ownership interest, and the availability of the Company’s common stock to the investing public
may be limited.

The
availability of Rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive
officers, directors and their affiliates, which could negatively impact Rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability
of minority stockholders to sell their shares. Future sales by executive officers, directors and their affiliates of all or a
portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.

Provisions
in Rollins, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the Company.

Rollins,
Inc.’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements
for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the Board of Directors. These provisions may make a tender offer, change in
control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company’s Board of Directors more difficult or expensive.

None

Item
2.    Properties.

The
Company’s administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia
30324. The Company owns or leases over 500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins
Training Center located in Atlanta, Georgia, the Rollins Customer Service Center located in Covington, Georgia, and the Pacific
Division Administration and Training Center in Riverside, California. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents
a materially important physical property of the Company. The facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably
anticipated future needs of the Company.


Item
3.    Legal Proceedings.

In
the normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage. In addition, the Company defends employment related cases and
claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business.
We are actively contesting each of these matters.

Management
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual quarter or year.

General
Operating Comments

marked the Company’s 21st consecutive year of improved revenues and profits. Revenues for the year rose 8.8 percent to $1.822
billion compared to $1.674 billion for the prior year. Income before income taxes increased 5.5% to $310.7 million compared to
$294.5 million the prior year. Net income increased 29.3% to $231.7 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.71 compared
to $179.1 million, or $0.55 per diluted share for the prior year.

All
of the Company’s business lines experienced growth for the year, with residential pest control revenues up 9.1%, commercial
pest control revenues up 6.0% and termite and ancillary services revenues up 12.8%, each compared to 2017.

Results
of Operations—2018 Versus 2017

Overview

The
Company’s revenues increased to $1.822 billion in 2018, an 8.8% increase compared to 2017. Gross margin decreased to 50.9%
for 2018 from 51.0% in 2017. Sales, general and administrative expense were 30.2% of revenues in 2018 compared to 30.1% in 2017.
The Company’s depreciation and amortization margin increased 0.3 percentage points to 3.7% in 2018 compared to 3.4% in 2017.
Rollins’ net income of $231.7 million in 2018 was an increase of $52.5 million or 29.3% over $179.1 million in 2017. Net
profit margin improved to 12.7% in 2018 from 10.7% in 2017. Rollins continued to expand our global brand recognition with acquisitions
in the United States, Canada, Singapore, and Australia as well as expanding our Orkin international franchise program in numerous
countries around the globe. The Company is now in 57 countries and continues to seek new international opportunities.


Revenues

Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.822 billion, an increase of $147.6 million or 8.8% from 2017 revenues of $1.674 billion.
Growth occurred across all service lines with our Canadian and Australian companies being hindered by unfavorable foreign currency
exchange rates. Growth and pricing accounted for approximately 5.3% of our increase and our acquisitions contributed the remaining
revenue growth. Commercial pest control represented approximately 39% of the Company’s revenue in 2018 and grew 6.0%. Acquisitions
from foreign companies, which are primarily commercial, contributed to the increase, as well as increases in sales, an emphasis
on closing leads, and better cancellation rates. Commercial pest control was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange
rates as our foreign companies are heavily commercial. Residential pest control, which represented approximately 42% of the Company’s
revenue, increased 9.1% driven by an increase in sold units, lead closure, a better cancellation rate, and pricing, as well as
increased TAEXX

®

homebuilder installations, and acquisitions. The Company’s termite business, which represented
approximately 18% of the Company’s revenue, grew 12.8% in 2018 due to acquisitions, increases in termite baiting and pretreatments,
and ancillary service sales (such as moisture control, insulation and deck and gutter work).

The
Company implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2018. Around 1% of the Company’s revenue increase is
attributable to pricing actions. Approximately 80% of the Company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2018, as well
as 2017.

The
Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively. The Company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2018 for
a total of 86 Orkin international franchises, two Canadian Critter Control franchises, and ten Orkin Australia franchises at December
31, 2018, compared to 81 Orkin international franchises, two Canadian Critter Control franchises and eleven Orkin Australia Franchises
at December 31, 2017.

International
and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the Company’s revenues for 2018. Orkin had 133 and 128 franchises (domestic
and international) at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company had 80 Critter Control franchises at December 31,
2018, down 9 from 2017. Critter Control Operations, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has begun the process of purchasing
Critter Control franchises. Revenue from franchising was up 30.4% in 2018 compared to 2017 as we expand Orkin’s international
footprint and recognition of initial franchise fees, partially offset by the decreases associated with acquired franchises from
Critter Control.

Cost
of Services Provided

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, cost of services provided increased $74.5 million or 9.1%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2017. Gross margin for the year decreased to 50.9% for 2018 compared to 51.0% for 2017 due to unfavorable personnel
related costs as we increased our 401k match to employees and experienced an increase in group insurance premiums in 2018 and
an increase in payroll taxes and FICA taxes. Administrative Salaries were up due to increased office wages as well as an increase
in restricted share amortization as we granted our long-term employees time-lapse restricted stock which is amortized over one
year. The Company experienced higher fleet costs as gasoline prices per gallon rose and miles driven increased with acquisitions
and additional work, which was partially offset by the usage of our routing and scheduling system. Leased vehicle costs increased as we added to our fleet and leased vehicle prices increased. Professional
services and Maintenance and repairs increased due to outside consultants and maintenance contracts on various IT projects and
equipment.

Depreciation
and Amortization

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, depreciation and amortization increased $10.2 million, or 18.0% compared to the twelve
months ended December 31, 2017. The dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing $3.0 million or 10.9% as we depreciate
acquired and purchased assets and depreciation from various IT related projects. Amortization of intangible assets increased $7.2
million or 24.8% for 2018 due to the additional amortization of customer contracts of several acquisitions over the last year
including a full year of Northwest Pest Control, acquired late 2017, and the 2018 acquisition of OPC Services as well as several
smaller foreign and domestic companies.

Sales,
General and Administrative

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $47.3 million, or 9.4%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. SG&A increased to 30.2% of revenues for the year ended December 31,
2018 compared to 30.1% in 2017. The Company increased its 401k match to employees and granted a one-time vested stock grant during
the year which increased personnel related costs and administrative salaries, respectively. Group insurance premiums were up for
the year as well as payroll taxes. The company’s acquisitions and rising gasoline costs and lease expenses raised our fleet
costs and the Company had increased use of outside professional services in IT projects as well as other projects.


Gain
on Sales of assets, Net

Gain
on sales of assets, net increased to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.2 million in 2017. The Company
recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and owned property in 2018 and 2017.

Interest
Income, Net

Interest
income, net for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Interest income
for each year is due to interest received on cash balances in the Company’s various cash accounts.

Taxes

The
Company’s 2018 net income was positively affected by the TCJA which was signed in to law on December 22, 2017. The estimated
positive impact of the enactment of the TCJA was a $38.4 million decrease to tax expense, which was a direct increase to net income.
2017 had an $11.6 million increase in tax as follows: $8.0 million from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million from
the revaluation of deferred tax assets, and $0.7 million from reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation. This resulted
in a $0.05 per diluted share decrease in net income for the 2018 fiscal year.

Results
of Operations—2017 Versus 2016

Overview

The
Company’s revenues increased to $1.674 billion in 2017, a 6.4% increase compared to 2016. Gross margin increased to 51.0%
for 2017 from 50.9% in 2016. Sales, general and administrative expense were 30.1% of revenues in 2017 compared to 31.2% in 2016.
The Company’s depreciation and amortization margin increased 0.2 percentage points to 3.4% in 2017 compared to 3.2% in 2016.
Rollins’ net income of $179.1 million in 2017 was an increase of $11.7 million or 7.0% over $167.4 million in 2016. Net
profit margin improved to 10.7% in 2017 from 10.6% in 2016. Rollins continued to expand our global brand recognition with acquisitions
in the United States and Canada as well as expanding our Orkin international franchise program in numerous countries around the
globe. The Company was in 53 countries at the end of 2017 and continues to seek new international opportunities.

Revenues

Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.674 billion, an increase of $100.5 million or 6.4% from 2016 revenues of $1.573 billion.
Growth occurred across all service lines and brands with our Canadian and Australian companies being hindered by unfavorable foreign
currency exchange rates. Organic growth and pricing accounted for approximately 4.5% of our increase and our acquisitions contributed
the remaining revenue growth. Commercial pest control represented approximately 40% of the Company’s revenue in 2017 and
grew 5.1% due to increases in sales, an emphasis on closing leads, increased bed bug revenue, and acquisitions. Commercial pest
control was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange as Orkin Canada and Rollins Australia are heavily commercial. Residential
pest control, which represented approximately 42% of the Company’s revenue, increased 6.4% driven by an increase in lead
closure, pricing, as well as increased TAEXX

®

homebuilder installations, and acquisitions. The Company’s
termite business, which represented approximately 18% of the Company’s revenue, grew 9.7% in 2017 due to acquisitions, increases
in drywood fumigations and ancillary service sales (such as moisture control and insulation).

The
Company implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2017. Less than 2% of the Company’s revenue increase
is attributable to pricing actions. Approximately 80% of the Company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2017 as well
as 2016.


The
Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% and 7% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively. The Company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2017 for
a total of 81 Orkin international franchises, two Canadian Critter Control franchises, and eleven Australian franchises operated
by Murray Pest Control and Scientific Pest Management at December 31, 2017, compared to 70 Orkin international franchises, two
Canadian Critter Control franchises and seven Australian Franchises at December 31, 2016.

International
and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the Company’s revenues for 2017. Orkin had 128 and 120 franchises (domestic
and international) at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company had 89 Critter Control franchises at December 31,
2017, down 5 from 2016. Critter Control Operations, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has begun the process of purchasing
Critter Control franchises. Revenue from franchises was down 2.9% in 2017 compared to 2016 as we acquire franchises from Critter
Control.

the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 cost of services provided increased $47.6 million or 6.2%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2016. Gross margin for the year increased to 51.0% for 2017 compared to 50.9% for 2016 due to favorable service
salary cost as we utilize BOSS, our CRM and operating system and VRM to improve our customer routing and scheduling to maximize
efficiencies. We had lower administrative salaries as we maximize our efficiencies and lower insurance and claims as we saw reductions
in our actuarial calculations on future losses and lower vehicle loss expenses. The favorable margins were partially offset by
higher fleet costs as gasoline prices rose and leased vehicle costs as we replace our fleet and materials and supplies as we increase
termite treatments. We experienced good cost controls across most spending categories during 2017 compared to 2016.

Depreciation
and Amortization

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization increased $5.7 million, or 11.2% compared to the twelve
months ended December 31, 2016. The dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing $2.7 million or 10.7% as we continue
to depreciate our CRM software BOSS, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.0 million or 11.5% for 2017 due to the
additional amortization of customer contracts of Northwest Pest Control, as well as several other acquisitions over the last year.

Sales,
General and Administrative

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $12.9 million, or 2.6%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. SG&A decreased to 30.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31,
2017 compared to 31.2% in 2016. The Company had a one-time tax event to dissolve its subsidiary, Kinro Investment Inc. in 2016.
This increased SG&A expense $9.1 million or 0.6 percentage points due to the one-time tax event that was offset as a credit
in income tax expense. Administrative salaries were relatively flat to prior year as we reduced the number of temporary personnel
working on the BOSS system. Personnel related costs were marginally lower as we experienced leveling of our premiums. Gains in
these areas were partially offset by higher sales salaries, fleet expense, and contractor expenses for various projects as well
as the aforementioned 2016 foreign tax withholding expense.

Gain
on Sales of assets, Net

Gain
on sales of assets, net decreased to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.8 million in 2016. The Company
recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and owned property in 2017 and 2016.

Interest
Income, Net

Interest
income, net for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Interest income
for each year is due to interest received on cash balances in the Company’s various cash accounts.

Taxes

The
Company’s effective tax rate increased to 39.2% in 2017 compared to 35.8% in 2016, due primarily to the effects of the TCJA
in 2017, a one-time tax event in 2016 and differences in state and foreign income taxes. The estimated impact of the enactment
of the TCJA was an $11.6 million increase to tax expense, which was a direct decrease to net income. The $11.6 million increase
in tax was as follows: $8.0 million from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million from the revaluation of deferred tax
assets, and $0.7 million from reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation. The increase due to the TCJA was partially offset
by a reduction related to the implementation of ASU 2016-09 that was a $4.0 million benefit.


Liquidity

Cash
and Cash Flow

Cash
from operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses.

The
most significant source of cash in Rollins’ cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which
is collecting cash resulting from services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees,
tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.

The
Company’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $115.5 million, $107.1 million, and $142.8
million, respectively.

Cash
Provided by Operating Activities

The
Company’s operations generated cash of $286.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily from net income of
$231.7 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $235.4 million in 2017 and $226.5 million in 2016. The
Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating
activities, available borrowings under its $175.0 million credit facility, and access to additional financing as needed, will
be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the
foreseeable future.

The
Company’s made no contributions to the Rollins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ defined benefit retirement
plans (the “Plans”) during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Plans were fully-funded with a prepaid balance. No
contributions were made in 2017 and $3.3 million was made during 2016, respectively, as a result of the Plans’ funding status.
The Company’s management is not expecting to make a contribution during fiscal year 2019. In the opinion of management,
additional Plan contributions, if any, will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
or liquidity.

The
Company has initiated the process to transition its Pension Plan to an Insurance provider. The timeline will take approximately
6-9 months from December 31, 2018. The Company’s Pension Plan is currently more than 100% funded.

Cash
Used in Investing Activities

The
Company used $101.4 million on investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $154.2 million and $76.8
million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, and of that, invested approximately $27.2 million in capital expenditures during 2018
compared to $24.7 million and $33.1 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily
of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology related projects. The Company expects to invest between $25 million
and $30 million in 2019 in capital expenditures. During 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries acquired several small to mid-sized
companies for a total of $76.8 million compared to $130.2 million and $46.3 million in acquisitions during 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The expenditures for the Company’s acquisitions were funded with cash on hand. The Company continues to seek new acquisitions.


Cash
Used in Financing Activities

The
Company used cash of $162.3 million on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $130.3 million and
$136.4 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. A total of $152.7 million was
paid in cash dividends ($0.47 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2018 including a special dividend paid in December
2018 of $0.09 per share, compared to $122.0 million in cash dividends paid ($0.37 per share) during the year ended December 31,
2017, including a special dividend paid in December 2017 of $0.07 per share and
$109.0 million paid in cash dividends ($0.33 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2016, including a special dividend
paid in December 2016 of $0.07 per share.

The
Company did not purchase shares on the open market during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 while using $22.7 million
to repurchase 1.3 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $18.13 per share during 2016. There remain
7.6 million shares, adjusted for the December 10, 2018 three-for-two stock split, authorized to be repurchased under prior Board
approval. The Company repurchased $9.5 million, $8.2 million, and $8.4 million of common stock for the years ended December 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.

The
Company’s $115.5 million of total cash at December 31, 2018 is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately
$53.6 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $61.9 million is primarily held in
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which
at times may exceed federally insured amounts.

The
Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future
through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash
from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The
Company maintains a large cash position in the United States while having no third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate
liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and
obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business.

The Company expects to close on the acquisition of Clark Pest Control of Stockton, Inc. during the first or
second quarters of 2019. The Company intends to fund purchase of the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, use of its
revolving credit agreement and a new term loan. The Closing of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions,
including the truth and accuracy of the representations and warranties of the sellers, the performance of the obligations of the
sellers and the receipt of regulatory clearance.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
Company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition
and results of operations, and that require management’s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances
that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual
for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors
that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number
of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible
to precisely predict future significant claims. Accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term
accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Accrued
Insurance—

The Company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’
compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued
based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may
not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts
with an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical
claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge
of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective
and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always
an accurate indication of future events. The Company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing
programs to reduce claims. Initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle
report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing,
increased driver training and a post-injury nurse triage program for employees.

Revenue
Recognition—

the Company’s Revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of
promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those
products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are
distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes
collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

More
on the Company’s revenue recognition policy can be found in the Company’s Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 1., Summary of Significant Accounting Policies with the heading Revenue Recognition.

Contingency
Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the
litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately
predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation
are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management,
the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.

Defined
benefit pension plans

— In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. defined
benefit plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005. The Company also
includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan to the Company’s financial statements. Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employees Pension Plan was amended, effective September 1, 2018, to freeze future
benefit accruals for all participants. The Company accounts
for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715

“Compensation- Retirement Benefits”

,
and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates
the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate,
and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.


The
Company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes,
the investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets
and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects
future pension expense. The Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from
the prior year.

In regards to the Rollins, Inc. Defined Benefit plan the company utilizes a termination liability approach.
This approach reflects the estimated impact of the distribution of benefits due to a standard termination. Plan liabilities will
be settled through the purchase of annuities from an insurance provider or through the distribution of lump sum payments to eligible
participants that elect to receive such a form of payment. Discount rates of 3.90% per year for participants in pay status and
4.11% per year for participants with deferred benefits were selected by the Plan Sponsor to determine the benefit obligation resulting
from plan termination annuity purchases. The discount rates reflect the single effective interest rate that produces the same present
value as that produced when the expected future cash flows for participants expected to elect an annuity are discounted with the
FTSE Yield Curve (formerly Citigroup) as of the measurement date. To determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination
lump sum payments, the expected future cash flows for lump sum eligible participants, determined with the IRC 417(e) Mortality
Table for 2019, were discounted with the IRC 417(e) segment interest rates for the month of November 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88%).
Only 50% of active, 30% of deferred vested, and 25% of retired participants that will be eligible to receive a lump sum distribution
of their pension benefit upon plan termination, are assumed to elect this form of payment.

The discount rate of 4.00% as of December 31, 2017 was updated as of December 31, 2018 to:

i)

3.90%, based on current market conditions, for participants in pay status expected to elect a plan termination
annuity,

ii)

4.11%, based on current market conditions, for active and terminated participants with deferred benefits expected
to elect a plan termination annuity,

iii)

The IRC 417(e) interest rates for the month of November 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88), based on plan provisions,
for all lump sum eligible expected to elect a plan termination lump sum.

Waltham
Services, LLC Hourly Employees Pension Plan utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the
Company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate
bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates
the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum
as the payments from the corporate bonds. The discount rate was 4.05% as of December 31, 2018 compared to 4.05% in 2017 and 4.35%
in 2016. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.

As
set forth in Note 16 to the Company’s financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan’s investments
are real estate, and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These
investments are categorized as investments at net asset value (“NAV”) and are valued using significant non-observable
inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2009-12 “

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),”

these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These
valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect
valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’
judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

As
of December 31, 2018, the defined benefit plans were fully-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive
income increased stockholders’ equity by $14.8 million before tax and $11.0 million after tax.

Item
7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
Risk

On
October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured
line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline
subfacility. The Credit Agreement was amended on October 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2018 and add three
optional one year extensions. On October 27, 2015 the Company exercised a one year extension option to extend the maturity date
to October 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility.
The Company maintains approximately $32.9 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company’s
fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured status, to secure various workers’
compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources
and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.


MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To
the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The
management of Rollins, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for the Company. Rollins, Inc. maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at
a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and
can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection
and training of qualified personnel. This system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting,
as of December 31, 2018 based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management’s assessment is that Rollins,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.

The
independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2018, and has also issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting, included in this report on page 24.

reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE

Board of Directors and Stockholders’

Rollins, Inc.

Opinion on the financial statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial position of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and financial statement schedule
included under item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in the 2013

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report
dated March 1, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Basis for opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP

We have served as the Company’s
auditor since 2004.

1.    SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business
Description

—Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the
state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control
services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America, Australia, and Europe
with international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, Canada,
Australia, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin,
LLC. (“Orkin”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite
control company. It provides customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin either serves customers directly or through franchise
operations, in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa,
and Mexico providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses,
including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under
the Orkin

®

, and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand
name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin
Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada’s largest
pest control provider and a leader in the development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western
Pest Services (“Western”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin
offers, focusing on the northeastern United States.

The
Industrial Fumigant Company (“IFC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins,
Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam
Pest Defense (“HomeTeam”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins,
Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx

®

tubes in the wall pest control
system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services
home builders nationally.

Rollins
Australia (“Rollins Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”),
in February 2014. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional commercial,
residential, and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity
program and provides specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.


Critter
Control, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. on February 27, 2015. Critter Control was established
in 1983 and is headquartered in Traverse City, Michigan. The business is primarily franchised, operating in 40 states and 2 Canadian
provinces.

Rollins
UK was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to acquire Safeguard Pest Control (“Safeguard”). Safeguard,
which was acquired in June 2016, is a pest control company established in the United Kingdom in 1991 with a history of providing
superior pest control, bird control, and specialist services to residential and commercial customers.

Northwest
Pest Control, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1951, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in August 2017. Northwest
specializes in residential and commercial termite control, pest control, mosquito control, wildlife services, lawn care, insulation,
and HVAC services, focusing on the Southeast United States.

The
Company has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets
for this segment, includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean,
Europe, Africa, and Mexico. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single
customer, few customers or foreign operations.

Principles
of Consolidation

—The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Rollins, Inc. and
our wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).
The Company does not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership interest of 50% or
less. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest
entity. Accordingly, the Company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. The Company reclassified certain prior period
amounts, none of which were material, to conform to the current period presentation. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.

Subsequent
Events

—The Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued.

On January 7, 2019, Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”) and certain of its affiliates entered into certain
agreements providing for the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of a pest control business as follows: (a) a Stock Purchase
Agreement among the Company, Clark Pest Control of Stockton, Inc. (“Clark Pest Control”), JJT King, Inc., and the stockholders
of Clark Pest Control pursuant to which the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Clark Pest Control,
(b) a Real Estate Purchase Agreement between RCI-King, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Clarkson California
Properties pursuant to which an affiliate of the Company will acquire certain real estate used in Clark Pest Control’s business,
and (c) an Asset Purchase Agreement between King Distribution, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Geotech Supply
Co., LLC pursuant to which an affiliate of the Company will acquire certain assets used in the business of distributing certain
equipment and supplies related to the pest control business of Clark Pest Control. Subject to post-closing adjustments, the final
purchase is expected to be in the area of $400 million including the real estate assets. The purchase price was negotiated at arm’s-length
and the agreement contains customary representations, warranties, noncompetition agreements and holdback provisions.

The Closing of the Acquisition is subject
to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the truth and accuracy of the representations and warranties of the sellers,
the performance of the obligations of the sellers and the receipt of regulatory clearance. The Company intends to fund purchase
of the Acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, use of its revolving credit agreement and a new term loan. The Company
expects the acquisition to close during the first or second quarters of 2019.

Estimates
Used in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

—The Company’s Revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised
products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products
or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct
and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected
from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.


Nature
of Goods and Services and Performance Obligations

The
Company contracts with its customers to provide the following goods and services, each of which is a distinct performance obligation:

Pest
control services - Rollins provides pest control services to protect residential and commercial properties from common pests,
including rodents and insects. Pest control generally consists of assessing a customer’s property for conditions that invite
pests, tackling current infestations, and stopping the life cycle to prevent future invaders. Revenue from pest control services
is recognized as services are rendered.

The
Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues upon satisfaction of the performance obligation
at the time services are performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus
the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services
are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may
receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues
are recognized at the time services are performed. The Company defers recognition of advance payments and recognizes the revenue
as the services are rendered. The Company classifies discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite
control services (including traditional and baiting) - Rollins provides both conventional and baiting termite protection services.
Traditional termite protection uses “Termidor” liquid treatment and/or dry foam and Orkin foam to treat voids and
spaces around the property, while baiting termite protection uses baits to disrupt the molting process termites require for growth
and offers ongoing protection. Revenue from initial termite treatment services is recognized as services are provided.

Maintenance/monitoring/inspection
- In connection with the initial service offerings, Rollins provides recurring maintenance, monitoring or inspection services
to help protect consumer’s property for any future sign of termite activities after the original treatment. This recurring
service is a service-type warranty under ASC 606 as it is routinely sold and purchased separately from the initial treatment services
and is typically purchased or renewed annually.

Termite
baiting revenues are recognized based on the transfer of control of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a
new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation
of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion
of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring performance obligation. This portion is recognized as income
on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue that depicts the Company’s
performance in transferring control of the service. The allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the
relative stand-alone selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified
performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line
basis that depicts the Company’s performance in transferring control of the service.

Revenue
received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term
that depicts the Company’s performance in transferring control of the service; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications
and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs
to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance of reinspections
tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts,
these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications
and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues
for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and
a provision is made for any expected losses.


Miscellaneous
services (e.g., cleaning, etc.) - In certain agreements with customers, Rollins may offer other miscellaneous services, including
restroom cleaning (e.g., eliminating foul odors, grease and grime which could attract pests), training (e.g., seminars covering
good manufacturing practices and product stewardship), etc. Revenue from miscellaneous services is recognized when services are
provided.

Products
- Depending on customer demand, Rollins may separately sell pest control and/or termite protection products, such as traps. Revenue
from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of the asset.

Equipment
rental (or lease) - Depending on customer demand, Rollins may lease certain pest control and/or termite protection equipment.
Revenue from equipment rentals are recognized over the period of the rental/lease. Revenue from equipment rentals represent less
than 1.0% of the Company’s revenues for each reported period.

Right
to access intellectual property (Franchise) - The right to access Rollins’ intellectual property is an essential part of
Orkin’s franchising agreements. These agreements provide the franchisee (the customer) a license to use the Rollins’
name and trademark when advertising and selling services to end customers in their normal course of business. Orkin Franchise
agreements contain a clause allowing Orkin to purchase certain assets of the franchisee. This is only an offer for Orkin to re-purchase
the assets originally provided by Orkin to the franchisee and is not a performance obligation or a form of consideration. International
and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1.0% of the Company’s annual revenues.

All
Orkin domestic franchises have a guaranteed repurchase clause that the Orkin franchise may be repurchased by Orkin at a later
date once it has been established. The Company amortizes the initial franchise fee over the initial franchise term. Deferred Orkin
franchise fees were $1.6 million at December 31, 2018 and $3.4 million December 31, 2017.

Royalties
from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues are earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from Orkin franchises was
$8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $5.4 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively.

Contract
Balances

Timing
of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record unearned revenue when revenue is recognized
subsequent to billing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage
period. The balance of long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $28.2 million as of December
31, 2018 and $20.4 million at December 31, 2017 and is included in financed receivables as a long-term asset on our consolidated
statements of financial position.

The
allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We
determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity
in the allowance for doubtful accounts can be found on Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.

Unearned
revenue is comprised mainly of unearned revenue related to the Company’s termite baiting offering, conventional renewals,
and year-in-advance pest control services for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control
of the product or service.

Refer
to Note 12 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including changes in unearned revenue for the year.

Payment
terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In
instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally
do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified
and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers
with financing.


Practical
Expedients and Exemptions

We
generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs
are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.

We
do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year
or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
All revenues are reported net of sales taxes.

The
Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability
of accounts receivable. Management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine
the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Substantially all of the Company’s receivables are due from pest control
and termite services in the United States and selected international locations. The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts
is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The Company’s
established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. Provisions
for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written-off against the allowance
for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written
off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery.
Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. There were no large recoveries
in 2018, 2017, and 2016. We record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial
obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial
position. If circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted,
either upward or downward.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

— The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates
fair market value.

The
Company’s $115.5 million of total cash at December 31, 2018, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions.
Approximately $53.6 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $61.9 million is primarily
held in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks
which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.

The
Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future
through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash
from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The
Company maintains a large cash position in the United States while having no third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate
liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and
obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business for the foreseeable future.

Marketable
Securities

— From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial
institutions. The Company’s investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than “investment
grade” by national rating services.

Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of
each balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to
hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and
losses reported as in earnings. Realized gains and losses and declines
in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included as a component of interest income.

The
Company had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined benefit pension plan and the non-qualified deferred
compensation plan at December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 16 for further details.

Materials
and Supplies

— Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is
determined on the first-in, first-out method.

Income
Taxes

—The Company provides for income taxes based on FASB ASC topic 740 “Income Taxes”, which requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The Company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it determines
that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. The Company establishes additional provisions
for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not
meet the minimum probability threshold. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters
in income tax expense.

Equipment
and Property

— Equipment and Property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are provided principally
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are computed
using the following asset lives: buildings, 10 to 40 years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, 2 to 10 years. Expenditures
for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from
the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. The annual provisions for
depreciation, below, have been reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

— In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 350,

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”

,
the Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization;
(2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. The Company does not amortize intangible
assets with indefinite lives or goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic
downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the Company
level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with
its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, then the Company will compare the
implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill
is less than its carrying value. The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the
fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge if
the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its most recent annual impairment analysis
as of September 30, 2018. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill
or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated.


Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets -

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 360,

“Property, Plant and Equipment”

,
the Company’s long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair
value of the asset. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets,
including customer contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Insurance

—The
Company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’ compensation and vehicle liability.
The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as
incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods)
and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts with an independent third
party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The
actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in business
practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of
factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication
of future events.

Accrual
for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors
that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual
number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible
to precisely predict future significant claims. An accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and
long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Contingency
Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.
In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

management estimates and accrues for its liability
and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because
it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities
and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued.
However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued
liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Three-for-two
stock split

—The Board of Directors at its quarterly meeting on October 23, 2018, authorized a three-for-two stock
split by the issuance on December 10, 2018 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at November
9, 2018. All share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are restated for the
three-for-two stock split.

Earnings
Per Share

—the FASB ASC Topic 260-10

“Earnings Per Share-Overall,”

requires a basic earnings per
share and diluted earnings per share presentation. Further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is
required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.

The
Company has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are
considered participating securities. See Note 17 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.


The
basic and diluted calculations are the same as there were no stock options included in diluted earnings per share as we have no
stock options outstanding. Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the respective periods.

A
reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common
stock (participating securities) is as follows (in thousands except per share data). All share and per share information in the
following chart are restated for the stock split effective December 10, 2018:

Translation
of Foreign Currencies

—Assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated
into U.S. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates
for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from
foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign
currency are included in the earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based
Compensation

— The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718 “

Compensation
– Stock Compensation

.” Time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management
employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain
stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. Outstanding TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments
starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive
all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued
provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.
The fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years.

Comprehensive
Income (Loss)

—Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) results from foreign currency translations and minimum pension liability
adjustments.


Franchising
Program

– Rollins’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, had 47, 47 and 50 domestic franchises as of December 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Transactions with Orkin’s domestic franchises involve sales of customer contracts to
establish new Orkin franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts and initial Orkin franchise fees
are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods ranging up to five years. Notes receivable from Orkin
franchises were $6.5 million at December 31, 2018 and $5.9 million at December 31, 2017. These amounts are included
as financing receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Right
to access intellectual property (Franchise) - The right to access Rollins’ intellectual property is an essential part of
Orkin’s franchising agreements. These agreements provide the franchisee (the customer) a license to use the Rollins’
name and trademark when advertising and selling services to end customers in their normal course of business. Orkin Franchise
agreements contain a clause allowing Orkin to purchase certain assets of the franchisee. This is only an offer for Orkin to re-purchase
the assets originally provided by Orkin to the franchisee and is not a performance obligation or a form of consideration. International
and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1.0% of the Company’s annual revenues.

The
Company amortizes the initial franchise fee over the initial franchise term. Deferred Orkin franchise fees of $1.6 million at
December 31, 2018 and $3.4 million December 31, 2017.

Royalties
from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues are earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from Orkin franchises was
$8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $5.4 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Orkin had 86, 81, and 70 international franchises, respectively. Orkin’s international
franchise program began with its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America,
the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico.

The
Company’s maximum exposure to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to the Orkin
franchises was $4.9 million, $2.5 million, and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Rollins’
wholly-owned subsidiary, Critter Control, had 80 and 89 franchises in the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively. Transactions with Critter Control franchises involve sales of territories to establish new franchises,
initial franchise fees and royalties. The territories and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash
and notes. Notes receivable from Critter Control franchises were $0.6 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017,
respectively. These notes are not guaranteed. The Company anticipates that should there be any losses from franchisees these losses
would be recouped by removing the individual franchisee and re-selling the abandoned territory. These amounts are included as
financing receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Recent
Accounting Guidance

Recently
adopted accounting standards

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and International Accounting Standards Board issued their
converged standard on revenue recognition Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers: Topic 606. This ASU replaces nearly all existing U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The standard prescribes
a five-step model for recognizing revenue, the application of which will require significant judgment. The FASB issued ASU 2015-14
in August 2015 which resulted in a deferral of the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. During 2016, the FASB issued four ASUs
that address implementation issues and correct or improve certain aspects of the new revenue recognition guidance, including ASU
2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-20, Technical
Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These ASUs do not change the core principles
in the revenue recognition guidance outlined above. ASU No. 2014-09 and the related ASUs referenced above are effective for Rollins,
Inc. beginning January 1, 2018. The Company has completed its detailed review of all global revenue arrangements in accordance
with these ASUs and the adoption of these ASUs January 1, 2018 has had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.


In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flow Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,
which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are
effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
periods within annual periods. Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual reporting period. The Company
adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 it had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Recently
issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2019 or later

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), which requires a lessee to recognize right-of-use assets (ROUs)
and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance
or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the statement of income.

ASU
2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. An entity may
elect to adopt the new standard using either 1) a modified retrospective approach with restated comparative period financial statements
or 2) a prospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment recognized to the opening balance of retained earnings on the
date of adoption. We anticipate adopting this standard on January 1, 2019, using the prospective approach. Consequently, the reporting
for the comparative periods presented in the financial statements in which the new leases standard has been adopted will continue
to be presented in accordance with current GAAP (Topic 840, Leases).

The
new standard provides certain practical expedients in transition. We have elected the transition package of practical expedients,
which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification
and initial direct cost. The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We elected
the short-term lease recognition exemption. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize right of use assets or lease liabilities,
for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.

The
Company expects the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its assets and liabilities due to the recognition of
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets. The recognition and measurement of expenses and
cash flows will not be materially impacted by the new standard. Upon adoption, the Company expects to recognize operating lease
ROUs and liabilities of between $175.0 million and $195.0 million. The new standard has enhanced disclosure requirements, including
additional disclosures regarding the nature of an entity’s leases, significant judgments and assumptions made when applying
the standard, and the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The disclosure requirements will have a material impact
on our financial statements.

In
June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The updated accounting guidance requires changes to the recognition of credit losses
on financial instruments not accounted for at fair value through net income. The guidance is effective for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated
financial statements.

In
January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,
which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment
test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting
unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on the current Step 1). The standard in this
update is effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning in 2020. Early adoption is
permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which provides new guidance intended to improve
the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities
in its financial statements. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2020. The adoption of this ASU is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


2.    ACQUISITIONS

The
Company has made 38 and 23 acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively, that are not material
individually or in the aggregate to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The largest acquisition made during
these periods is as follows:

The
Company completed the acquisition of Northwest Pest Control effective August 1, 2017. Northwest was established in 1951 and services
approximately 120,000 customers in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and North Carolina. Northwest Pest Control is
the 17th largest pest control operator in the country, making it the largest Rollins acquisition since the Company acquired HomeTeam
Pest Defense in 2008.

Total
cash purchase price for the Company’s acquisitions in 2018 and 2017 were $76.8 million and $130.2 million, respectively.

The
fair values of major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed along with the contingent consideration liability recorded

3.    REVENUE

Adoption
of ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. On January 1, 2018, and the Company adopted ASC 606 using the
modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2017. Results for reporting
periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue
to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC 605.

There
was no material impact on the Company’s financial statements as a result of adopting ASC 606 for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

4.    DEBT

On
October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured
line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline
subfacility. The Credit Agreement was amended on October 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2018 and add three
optional one year extensions. On October 27, 2015 the Company exercised a one year extension option to extend the maturity date
to October 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility.
The Company maintains approximately $32.9 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company’s
fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured status, to secure various workers’
compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources
and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

The
Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement
is October 31, 2019, subject to up to two optional extensions of the Credit Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under
the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company’s election:

·

the
                                         Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative
                                         Agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal
                                         Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals
                                         LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the
                                         U.S. Federal Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month,

plus

1.0% per annum.

·

with
                                         respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus an additional amount,
                                         which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon Rollins’ then-current debt-to-EBITDA
                                         ratio. As of December 31, 2018, the additional rate allocated was .75%.


The
Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants
including covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate
with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants
restricting the Company’s ability to permit the ratio of the Company’s consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain
limits.

The
Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2018 and expects to maintain compliance throughout
2019.

5.    TRADE
RECEIVABLES

The
allowance for doubtful accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency
aging totals, based on contractual terms, for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company
policies that are specific to pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

6.    FINANCING
RECEIVABLES

Rollins
manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. The Company’s credit
risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising Rollins’ customer base and dispersion across many different
geographical regions. The credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an assessment of
the individual’s Beacon/credit bureau score. Rollins requires a potential obligor to have good credit worthiness with low
risk before entering into a contract. Depending upon the individual’s credit score the Company may accept with 100% financing
or require a significant down payment or turndown the contract. Delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. Financing
receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.

Total
financing receivables, net were $46.7 million and $37.7 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Financing
receivables are generally charged-off when deemed uncollectable or when 180 days have elapsed since the date of the last full
contractual payment. The Company’s charge-off policy has been consistently applied during the periods reported. Management
considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Gross charge-offs
as a percentage of average financing receivables were 3.8% and 4.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and December
31, 2017, respectively. Due to the low percentage of charge-off receivables and the high credit worthiness of the potential obligor,
the entire Rollins, Inc. financing receivables portfolio has a low credit risk.


The
Company offers 90 days same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their credit worthiness. Interest is not recognized until
the 91st day at which time it is recognized retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. In
certain circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest
when they reach 180 days past due. As of December 31, 2018, there were six accounts that are greater than 180 days past due, which
have been fully reserved.

Included
in financing receivables are notes receivable from franchise owners. The majority of these notes are low risk as the repurchase
of these franchises is guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, Inc., and the repurchase price of the
franchise is currently estimated and has historically been well above the receivable due from the franchise owner. Also included
in notes receivables are franchise notes from other brands which are not guaranteed and do not have the same historical valuation.

The
carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of
contracts. Long-Term Installment receivables, net were $28.2 million and $20.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Rollins
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to insure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The
allowance balance is comprised of a general reserve, which is determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance,
and a specific reserve, which is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy
or other events, that make it unlikely that Rollins will recover its investment. The general reserve percentages are based on
several factors, which include consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted-average
risk rating of the portfolio and information derived from competitive benchmarking.

Total
depreciation expense was approximately $30.4 million in 2018, $27.4 million in 2017 and $24.7 million in 2016.

8.    FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENT

The
Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables,
accounts payable, and other short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair
values. The Company has financial instruments related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed
in Note 16.

The
fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair
values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using
significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.

The
following table presents our non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31,
2018.

The
Company has contingent considerations from acquisitions that approximate fair value and are Level 3.

At
December 31, 2018 the Deferred Compensation Plan had 70 life insurance policies with a net face value of $43.4 million. The
cash surrender value of these life insurance policies had a net realizable value of $18.3 million and $18.3 million at December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The total deferred compensation plan assets, recorded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated
statements of financial position, were $18.4 million and $18.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

9.    GOODWILL

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill
was $368.5 million at December 31, 2018 and $346.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Goodwill increased for the year ended
December 31, 2018 due primarily to acquisitions, partially offset by currency conversion of foreign goodwill. The carrying
amount of goodwill in foreign countries was $54.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and $46.3 million as of December 31, 2017.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

10.    CUSTOMER
CONTRACTS, TRADENAMES AND TRADEMARKS, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Customer
contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio
that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance
with the FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles - Goodwill and other”, the expected lives of customer contracts were reviewed,
and it was determined that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of 7 to 20 years dependent upon customer type. The
carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:

11.    DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Risk
Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The
Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. To manage this risk, the
Company enters into derivative financial instruments from time to time. Certain of the Company’s foreign operations expose
the Company to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of the Company’s
cash receipts and payments in terms of the Company’s functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments
from time to time to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional currency, the U.S.
dollar.


Hedges
of Foreign Exchange Risk

The
Company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency, the US dollar. The Company uses
foreign currency derivatives, specifically vanilla foreign currency forwards, to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the USD-CAD
and AUD-USD exchange rates. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the foreign currency exchange rate for delivery of a specified
amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in US dollars for their
fair value at or close to their settlement date.

The
Company does not currently designate any of these foreign exchange forwards under hedge accounting, but rather reflects the changes
in fair value immediately in earnings. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company’s
exposure to foreign exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded
directly in earnings and were equal to a net gain of $0.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and a net
loss of $0.3 million in 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had the following outstanding derivatives that were not
designated as hedges in qualifying hedging relationships (in thousands except for number of instruments):

On
December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law. The TCJA reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%
and made numerous other tax law changes. In 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 which permitted the recording
of provisional amounts related to the impact of the TCJA during a measurement period not to exceed one year. A provisional amount
based on reasonable estimates was made with respect to the tax implications associated with the deemed repatriated earnings on
foreign subsidiaries based on the initial analysis of the TCJA. Certain tax effects of the TCJA were recognized in year ended
December 31, 2017 resulting in the recording of $11.6 million of additional tax expense. The additional tax of $11.6 million related
to the following components: $8 million related to the imposition of a tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries
due to implementation of a territorial tax system, $2.9 million related to re-measurement of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax
rate, and $0.7 million related to reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation. During 2018 the Company completed the analysis
the earnings and profits of foreign investments. This resulted in the recognition at year ended December 31, 2018 of an additional
$1.2 million related to the imposition of a tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected
to include the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) as part of tax expense in the year incurred.


The
Provision for Income Taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.4% on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December
31, 2018. The effective rate differs from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes
and adjustments due to the TCJA.

For
2017 and 2016 the effective tax rate was 39.2% and 35.8%, respectively. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual
federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes, adjustments due to the TCJA partially offset by
tax benefits associated with restricted stock, and the increase of available foreign tax credits.

During
2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company paid income taxes of $77.3 million, $90.7 million and $88.8 million, respectively, net of refunds.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities
at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

As
of December 31, 2018, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately
$111.6 million, which will be available to offset future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between
2019 and 2031. Management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $0.4 million of foreign net operating
losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards.
The valuation allowance increased by $0.1 million due to foreign net operating leases.


Earnings
from continuing operations before income tax included foreign income of $22.7 million in 2018, $22.1 million in 2017 and $6.4
million in 2016. The Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign
markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisition of unrelated companies.
Repatriation of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not part of the Company’s current business plan.

The
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $0.0
million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The
Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various state and international jurisdictions that are currently under audit for
years ranging from 2012 through 2015. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S.,
income tax examinations for years prior to 2012.

It
is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next 12 months.

The
Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest
and penalties were $1.0 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. During 2018 the
Company recognized interest and penalties of $0.1 million.

14.    ACCRUAL
FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In
accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims
representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other
costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government
regulation.

In
the normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage. In addition, the Company defends employment related cases and
claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business.
We are actively contesting each of these matters.

Management
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual quarter or year.

16.    EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS

Defined
Benefit Pension Plans

Rollins,
Inc. Retirement Income Plan

The
Company maintains several noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”) covering employees
meeting certain age and service requirements. The Plans provide benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five
years during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated
Social Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plans with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company
made no contribution for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and $3.3 million to the Plans during the year 2016.

In
2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan, although the Company remains
obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005. In 2016, the Plan was amended to allow certain vested participants
the ability to elect for a limited time the commencement of their benefit in the form of a single-sum payment, not to exceed $35,000,
or an annuity starting date of December 1, 2016. In total $8.8 million was paid by the Plan during the year ended December 31,
2016, under this program. The Plan did not offer any options for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.


The
Company includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan in the Company’s financial statements. The Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan was amended, effective September 1, 2018, to freeze
future benefit accruals for all participants. The
Company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation- Retirement
Benefits”, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary,
the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan
assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.

The
Company has initiated the process to transition its Pension Plan to an Insurance provider and does not expect to amortize a net
loss in 2019. The timeline will take approximately 6-9 months from December 31, 2018. The Company’s Pension Plan is currently
more than 100% funded.

In
June 2005, the Company froze the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit pension plan. The Company currently uses December 31 as the
measurement date for its defined benefit post-retirement plans. The funded status of the Plans and the net amount recognized in
the statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans were $203.4 million and $202.3 million at December 31,
2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially
the same for the Plans. Pre-tax (increases)/decreases in the pension liability which were (charged, net of tax) credited to other
comprehensive income/(loss) were ($14.8) million, $19.0 million, and $3.0 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

In 2018, the Company used a termination liability approach in calculating the 2018 discount rate for the Rollins, Inc.
Pension plan. The following assumptions were used 1) 3.90%, based on current market conditions, for participants in pay
status expected to elect a plan termination annuity; 2) 4.11%, based on current market conditions, for active and
terminated participants with deferred benefits expected to elect a plan termination annuity; 3) The IRC 417(e) interest rates
for the month of November 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88), based on plan provisions, for all lump sum eligible expected to
elect a plan termination lump sum. The Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan applied 4.05% discount rate based
on yield curve analysis.

The
return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of
investments held in the plan. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the
expected returns on the plan investments.

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled
at the end of the year.  In estimating this rate, the Company utilized a termination liability approach for fiscal year 2018
and a yield curve analysis for fiscal year’s 2017, and 2016.

For
each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of
return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. The investment
policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans utilize a number of investment
approaches, including individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable,
and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. The Company and management are not considering making contributions to the pension
plans during fiscal 2019.

Some
of our assets, primarily our private equity

,

real estate, and hedge funds, do not have readily
determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. For
the December 31, 2018 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily
determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager statements combined with discussions focusing on underlying
fundamentals and significant events. Additionally, these investments are categorized as NAV investments and are valued using significant
non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with ASU No. 2011-12 “Investments
In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),” these investments are valued based on
the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments
and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments.
The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions
by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

Fair
Value Measurements

Given the funded status of the Rollins, Inc. Plan, the Company has modified the overall investment strategy
to mitigate risk related to volatility with asset types by transitioning to a higher percentage of fixed income securities. As
such, the Company's overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 50 percent of investments to match long-term
pension obligations and 50 percent for near term benefits payments, with a diversification of assets types, fund strategies and
fund managers. With the modification of investment strategy, the Company has transitioned the majority of its assets to Fixed-income
securities. Fixed-income securities include corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds, and U.S. Treasuries.
Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies domiciled domestically and internationally. Other types of investments include real estate funds and private equity funds that follow several different
investment strategies. For each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize
the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension
benefits. The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans
utilize a number of investment approaches, including but not limited to individual market securities, equity and fixed income
funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation.


The
Company has initiated the process to transition its Pension Plan to an Insurance provider and does not expect to amortize a
net loss in 2019. The timeline will take approximately 6-9 months from December 31, 2018. The Company’s Pension Plan
is currently more than 100% funded. Discount rates of 3.90% per year for participants in pay status and 4.11% per year for
participants with deferred benefits were selected by the Plan Sponsor to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan
termination annuity purchases. The discount rates reflect the single effective interest rate that produces the same present
value as that produced when the expected future cash flows for participants expected to elect an annuity are discounted with
the FTSE Yield Curve (formerly Citigroup) as of the measurement date. To determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination lump sum payments, the expected future
cash flows for lump sum eligible participants, determined with the IRC 417(e) Mortality Table for 2019, were discounted with the
IRC 417(e) segment interest rates for the month of November 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88%).

The

Defined
Contribution 401(k) Savings Plan

The
Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) Savings Plan that is available to a majority of the Company’s full-time employees
the first day of the calendar quarter following completion of three months of service. The Plan is available to non-full-time
employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one year of service upon completion of 1000 hours in that year. The
Plan changed to provide for a matching contribution of one dollar ($1.00) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participants contributions
to the Plan that do not exceed 3 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which include commissions, overtime, and bonuses)
and fifty cents ($0.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant’s contributions to the Plan over the initial 3 percent
that do not exceed 6 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses), up
from a matching contribution of fifty cents ($0.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participants contributions to the Plan that
do not exceed 6 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which include commissions, overtime and bonuses) in 2017 and 2016.
The charge to expense for the Company match was approximately $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $12.1
million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2018, 2017,
and 2016 approximately, 41.7%, 38.8%, and 36.4%, respectively of the plan assets consisted of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total
administrative fees paid by the Company for the Plan were less than $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016.

Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan

The
Deferred Compensation Plan provides that participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual bonus
with respect to any given plan year, subject to a $2 thousand per plan year minimum. The Company may make discretionary contributions
to participant accounts. The Company credited accounts of participants of long service to the Company with certain discretionary
amounts (“Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions”) in lieu of benefits that previously accrued under the Company’s
Retirement Income Plan up to a maximum of $245 thousand.

Accounts
will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain “Measurement
Funds.” Account values are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and Company credits had been converted into shares
or other ownership units of selected Measurement Funds by purchasing (or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the
current purchase price of the relevant Measurement Fund at the time of the participant’s selection. Deferred Compensation
Plan benefits are unsecured general obligations of the Company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with
the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company has established a “rabbi trust,”
which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to indirectly fund any obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the
extent that the Company’s obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan exceed assets available under the trust, the
Company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Generally,
the Deferred Compensation Plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant’s
death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment (a “Termination Event”). However, for any deferrals
of salary and bonus (but not Company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is
prior to a Termination Event. Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions
under the Deferred Compensation Plan in installments or lump-sum payments.


At
December 31, 2018, the Deferred Compensation Plan had 70 life insurance policies with a net face value of $42.6 million.
The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies were worth $17.3 million and $18.3 million at December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively.

The
estimated life insurance premium payments over the next five years are as follows:

liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position. The amounts of assets were marked to fair value.

17.    STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION

Stock
Compensation Plans

Time
Lapse Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units

Time
lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company’s Employee
Stock Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding over the remainder
of the service period. The compensation cost recorded for these awards is based on their closing stock price at the grant date
less the cost of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
periods to reflect actual forfeitures. Cash flows related to share-based payment awards to employees that result in tax benefits
in excess of recognized cumulative compensation cost (excess tax benefits) are classified as a financing activity in the accompanying
consolidated statements of cash flows.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain
stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting
with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends
declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that
shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

In April 2018, the Company granted a one-time issuance of TLRSs on a tiered Company tenure basis to U.S. based
employees. The one-time grant vests 100 percent on the first anniversary date of the granted shares. The total shares granted were
less than 0.1 million shares. During the year, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted
shares. The agreements under which the one-time restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise
transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

All
share and per share information has been adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective December 10, 2018.

The
Company issued time lapse restricted shares of 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and
2016, respectively.


The
Company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2018, approximately 5.9 million shares
of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718, “

Compensation
– Stock Compensation,”

the Company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight line basis over the service
periods of each award. The Company estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.
