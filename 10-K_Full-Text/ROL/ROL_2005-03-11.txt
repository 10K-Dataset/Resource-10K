================================================================================



                                     PART I

     Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in 1948 under the
laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

     The Company is a national  service  company  with  headquarters  located in
Atlanta,   Georgia,   providing  pest  and  termite  control  services  to  both
residential  and commercial  customers in North America.  Services are performed
through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

     Orkin, Inc. ("Orkin"),  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company founded in
1901,  is one of the world's  largest  pest and termite  control  companies.  It
provides  customized  services  from over 400  locations  to  approximately  1.6
million  customers.  Orkin  serves  customers in the United  States,  Canada and
Mexico, providing essential pest control services and protection against termite
damage,  rodents and insects to homes and  businesses,  including  hotels,  food
service  establishments,   food  manufacturers,   retailers  and  transportation
companies.   Orkin  operates  under  the  Orkin(R)  and  PCO  Services,  Inc.(R)
trademarks  and the AcuridSM  service mark.  The Orkin(R) brand name makes Orkin
the most recognized  pest and termite  company in the country.  The PCO Services
brand name provides  similar  brand  recognition  in Canada.  The Company is the
largest pest control provider in Canada.

     On April 30, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed  certain  liabilities  of Western  Pest  Services  ("Western"),  and the
Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  include the operating results of
Western from the date of the acquisition.  Since Western's  founding in 1928, it
has been a leader in the pest  control  business and is  recognized  for quality
customer  service.  Western provides pest  elimination  services to over 130,000
customers  from New York to Virginia with  additional  operations in Florida and
Georgia. Many of Western's locations complement Orkin's network, including their
strong commercial presence in the Northeast. A service niche in which Western is
particularly strong is healthcare facilities. Western is the sole vendor for the
New Jersey Hospital  Association and provide  services to over 400 nursing homes
and over 1,400 healthcare facilities.  Western also provides commercial services
to the food processing industry, office buildings and restaurants.

     The Company has only one reportable  segment,  its pest and termite control
business.  Revenue,  operating profit and identifiable  assets for this segment,
which includes the United States,  Canada and Mexico,  are included in Item 8 of
this document, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" on pages 28 and 29.
The Company's results of operations and its financial  condition are not reliant
upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company's foreign operations.

     Orkin's  "every  other  month"  (EOM)  service  continues  to  attract  new
customers,  and we expect this  business  will  likewise  increase in popularity
during  2005.  Currently,  approximately  60% of  Orkin's  existing  residential
customers are  utilizing our EOM service and over 70% of our new customers  have
opted for this service.

     We are expanding  regional call centers covering  multiple branch locations
to improve  leads sold and sales  started more  efficiently  than single  branch
efforts. Initial results suggest better capturing of inbound calls and increased
sales. We are carefully examining the progress of these Call Centers, however we
expect the  majority of our leads will be handled  through  this network of Call
Centers next year. We are  developing  new ways to add  customers  which include
personalized mailers to new homeowners, outbound calls to cancelled accounts and
unsold leads, and offering multi service  discounts for our existing termite and
pest control customers when buying the second service program.

     In 2004, we emphasized selling by our technicians as a means for generating
incremental pest control business and are pleased with our progress. We have the
opportunity for improving and now have the monthly reporting in place to monitor
this program more closely.


     In 2003, Orkin formed a Commercial  Steering  Committee (CSC) to review how
we conduct commercial  business across the entire  organization and to recommend
improvements.  The CSC  presented a course of action to the  Executive  Steering
Committee  in June 2004  which  outlined a plan to enhance  and  streamline  our
business and better serve our commercial  customers.  Additionally,  the CSC was
charged  to  coordinate  the  various  initiatives  which  touch our  commercial
business and to integrate them into a more efficient  whole.  To carry out their
charter provided by the Executive Steering  Committee,  the CSC established five
action  teams to  target  key  business  processes,  Sales,  Product  Packaging,
Customer  Management,  Service  Delivery  and Finance and  Billing.  These teams
designed  related business  processes to improve  efficiency and made technology
requirement  recommendations to support these new processes. The design phase of
the commercial project was completed at year end. An implementation  team is now
in the  process of being  formed and IT  projects  for  Customer  reporting  and
Routing and Scheduling are now being initiated.

     Orkin's  educational  partnerships  also  provided  new  opportunities  and
additional  brand  awareness,  and our  Company  is  especially  proud  of three
outstanding  initiatives.  First,  our  partnership  with the  National  Science
Teachers Association (NSTA), a nationwide organization with over 50,000 members,
offers  teachers the  opportunity to have an Orkin Man visit their  classroom to
teach  children about the  importance of insects in our  environment.  At NSTA's
national  conference  in April  2004,  956  teachers  signed up for an Orkin Man
presentation  and 4,000 Orkin pest  identification  posters were  distributed as
teaching guides.  Second,  the O. Orkin Insect Zoo at the Smithsonian  Museum of
Natural  History in  Washington  D.C.  welcomed  more  visitors  than almost any
exhibit in the  museum.  Upgraded  in 2003,  the  exhibit  continues  to educate
children and adults on the value of insects in their surroundings.  And thirdly,
we have initiated a new collaboration alliance with the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control  and  Prevention  (CDC) to  develop  educational  projects  that  target
health-related  risks.  As we  announced  in July 2004,  Orkin  will  co-develop
materials to help our pest management  professionals  provide more comprehensive
information  to our customers and expand  health-related  information on Orkin's
website.  For the next 12 months,  we will also co-develop and distribute public
information   regarding  pests  and  the  prevention  of  associated  infectious
diseases.

     Orkin's  commercial pest control  programs enable us to deliver  customized
service to industries  such as food  processing and  distribution,  discount and
grocery  retailers,  fast food,  healthcare  and  restaurants.  As the  nation's
largest  commercial pest control provider,  the Company services national chains
(primarily  sold  through the Orkin  National  Accounts  department)  as well as
locally-owned  businesses.  A primary  goal of the  Company is to grow  national
account  revenue  at a pace that will  enable us to  further  expand  our market
share.

     Orkin introduced the Gold Medal Protection  program in the United States in
2003,  which  continues  to attract new  customers.  This  custom-designed  pest
control service is targeted to specific high-end commercial  customers primarily
in the food  manufacturing  and  processing  industry.  The  program  provides a
comprehensive   reporting   system  that  meets  federal  and  state  regulatory
requirements.  When a customer  buys the Gold Medal  program  they are  engaging
Orkin's  quality  assurance  people,   including   professional   entomologists,
sanitarians,  food safety experts and commercial  and industry  specialists,  to
meet the client's expectations.  The pest control assurance program is improving
the service  being  provided  to  commercial  customers  and  building  stronger
relationships.  The Company is also improving our handheld computer capabilities
to support these customers.  The program also guarantees free retreatment if the
customer is not satisfied and Orkin commits to paying any  regulatory  penalties
as a result of a  shortfall  in our  service.  This was the first  pest  control
program of its kind in North America to receive ISO 9002 certification.

     Research has shown that termites  cause more damage to American  structures
than fires and storms combined.  Orkin offers a treatment customized to a home's
needs including inside,  outside and within the foundation.  Our directed liquid
and directed  liquid plus bait programs have been developed in conjunction  with
the entomology departments at leading universities. As a result, our approach to
treating for subterranean  termites has become the standard adopted by most pest
control operators today.

     In 2004, we began promoting our AutoPay  customer  purchase  option,  which
allows new  customers to use their debit or credit card to pay for their service
automatically.  We believe customers will  increasingly  utilize this convenient
option. We are also finding that this offer of convenience is appreciated, as we
have a better retention rate for the AutoPay customers.



     As more people turn to the Internet to help manage their active lives,  the
Orkin website  (www.orkin.com)  provides important online services while gaining
recognition  for the Orkin  brand.  We believe  that the  Internet  presents  an
excellent  opportunity for generating future growth for our company,  and we are
just  beginning to appreciate  this potential and take advantage of it. In 2002,
Orkin  received less than 100 leads from our company  website;  but by 2004, our
focus and  investment  in this area led to over 46,000 leads.  Our  "interactive
capability"  means that  customers can schedule  their  service  online or ask a
technical  question - any time of the day or night.  Almost  2,000  customers or
prospects were visiting our website daily by year end.

     The Global  Positioning  System ("GPS")  technology,  introduced four years
ago, has resulted in improved driver safety and service  production.  Now, newer
generation GPS units are installed that allow 24 / 7 monitoring and reporting of
speed,  location,  and  seatbelt  usage as well as allowing  remote  updating of
mapping  software.  This technology also details the route a service  technician
takes rather than just noting stops.  These units create reports that are easier
to read and allow data to be sent directly to a server.  This equipment is being
utilized in all of our Orkin  branches and we are  optimistic  that it will be a
building block to creating a comprehensive  "routing and  scheduling"  system in
the future.

     The dollar amount of service  contracts and backlog orders as of the end of
the Company's 2004 and 2003 calendar years was up by 38% to approximately  $43.1
million and $31.3 million, respectively. Backlog services and orders are usually
provided within the month following the month of receipt,  except in the area of
prepaid pest control and bait monitoring  services,  which are usually  provided
within twelve months of receipt. The Company does not have a material portion of
its business that may be subject to  renegotiation  of profits or termination of
contracts at the election of a governmental entity.

     Orkin was  recognized by Training  magazine as one of the Top 100 companies
to excel in training  and employee  development  for the third year in a row for
2004. The award is given to select companies that have created positive learning
environments for their workforce. Orkin attained further recognition in 2004 for
its training program by achieving first place honors for the BEST Award given by
the American Society for Training and Development.  The Rollins Training Center,
located in Atlanta,  was  specifically  referenced  as evidence of the Company's
dedication to employee performance improvement.  The Rollins Training Center has
a full-size house and several other real examples of building  structures  where
technicians can see the relationship  between pests and home construction.  They
can also practice  performing pest treatments under the supervision of qualified
instructors.  In  the  classrooms,  technicians  acquire  guidance  in  customer
relations,  pest problem  solving and advanced  technical  skills through highly
interactive instructor-led training.

     In 2004,  we expanded our 27,000 square foot Atlanta  training  facility to
include a 13,000  square foot  commercial  training  center.  This new  facility
includes a commercial kitchen,  bakery,  hotel room, hospital room, locker room,
pharmacy,  restaurant,  supermarket  and warehouse  space. We are confident that
this industry-specialized  training will help ensure that commercial technicians
provide the best integrated pest management  (IPM) service to their customers as
they learn how to both identify and correct  potential pest problems before they
occur.  Training in the commercial section began in August 2004, and the Company
anticipates  that an  increasing  number of  technicians  will receive  training
through our Atlanta commercial or residential centers during 2005.

     Rollins'  business  development  managers,  working  hand-in-hand  with our
division vice presidents and regional managers, continue to add to the Company's
sales  and  marketing  program  success.  As a  result  of  improvement  in lead
generation and increased  sales,  sales  employee  retention has improved in our
branches across the country.

     The Company  continues  to expand its growth  through  the Orkin  franchise
program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently
not  economically  feasible to locate a  conventional  Orkin branch.  There is a
contractual  buyback  provision at the  Company's  option with a  pre-determined
purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise.  There were
49  Company  franchises  at the end of 2004  compared  to 44 at the end of 2003.
Subsequently,  the  Company  opened  two more  franchises  on January 1, 2005 to
expand our total to 51 franchises.



Seasonality

     The  business  of the Company is  affected  by the  seasonal  nature of the
Company's pest and termite control  services.  The increase in pest pressure and
activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the
occurrence of which is  determined by the timing of the change in seasons),  has
historically  resulted in an increase in the revenue of the  Company's  pest and
termite  control  operations  during such periods as evidenced by the  following
chart.  In  addition,  revenues  were  favorably  impacted  in  2004  after  the
acquisition of Western Pest Services on April 30, 2004.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

        * Restated for change in accounting principle.

Inventories

     The Company has  relationships  with multiple  vendors for pest and termite
control  treatment  products  and  maintains a  sufficient  level of  chemicals,
materials  and other  supplies to fulfill its immediate  servicing  needs and to
alleviate any potential  short-term  shortage in availability  from its national
network of suppliers.

     In early  August  2004,  the Company  signed an  agreement  with Univar USA
whereby  Univar will provide  warehouse,  logistical  and delivery  services for
Orkin's  branches  throughout  the United States.  Univar had been  successfully
supplying  Orkin's Pacific  Division and the Western  Commercial  Region for the
past year. This arrangement  enables the Company to concentrate even more on its
core  pest and  termite  control  business.  It will  speed up the  delivery  of
products to all branches, which will result in an improved service support while
lowering branch inventories and freight costs.

     As part of the agreement with Univar,  Univar also acquired  certain assets
of Dettelbach Pesticide Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Orkin.  Dettelbach, a
southeastern  pest  control   materials   distributor,   offered   insecticides,
termiticides,  and  equipment  to  pest  control  professionals  and  previously
contributed approximately $3.0 million in annual revenue to the Company.

Competition

     The Company believes that Rollins, through Orkin and Western Pest Services,
competes  favorably  with  competitors  as one of the world's  largest  pest and
termite control companies, including Terminix and Ecolab.

     The principal  methods of  competition  in the  Company's  pest and termite
control business are quality of service and guarantees, including the money-back
guarantee on pest and termite  control,  and the termite  retreatment and damage
repair guarantee to qualified homeowners.

Research and Development

     Expenditures  by  the  Company  on  research  activities  relating  to  the
development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and
improved service methods and products are researched,  developed and produced by
unaffiliated  universities  and companies.  Also, a portion of these methods and
products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.

     Some of the more recent  studies that have been  conducted on behalf of the
Company include studies on fly pathogens,  ant pathogens,  and other pests found
in the  food-processing  environment by the  University of Florida.  The Company
maintains a close  relationship  with  several  universities  for  research  and
validation of treatment procedures and material selection.



     The  Company  also  conducts  tests  of  new  products  with  the  specific
manufacturers of such products.  These include a new proprietary mousetrap and a
biological  foaming agent for commercial drain cleaning.  The Company also works
closely with  industry  consultants  to improve  service and  establish  new and
innovative methods and procedures.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

     The Company's Pest Control  business is subject to various  legislative and
regulatory  enactments  that are  designed  to protect the  environment,  public
health and consumer protection. Compliance with these requirements has not had a
material  negative  effect  on the  Company's  financial  position,  results  of
operations or liquidity.

Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act ("FIFRA")

     This federal law (as amended) grants the responsibility of the states to be
the  primary  agent in  enforcement  and  conditions  under  which pest  control
companies operate.  Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental
Protection  Agency in  regulating  the  following:  licensing,  record  keeping,
contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This
allows  each  state to  institute  certain  features  that set their  regulatory
programs in keeping  with  special  interests  of the  citizens'  wishes in each
state.  The pest  control  industry  is  impacted  by these  federal  and  state
regulations.

Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 ("FQPA")

     The FQPA governs the manufacture,  labeling, handling and use of pesticides
and does not have a direct impact on how we conduct our business.

Environmental Remediation

     The Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation and Liability Act
("CERCLA"),  also known as Superfund,  is the primary Federal statute regulating
the cleanup of inactive  hazardous  substance  sites and imposing  liability for
cleanup on the responsible  parties.  Responsibilities  governed by this statute
include the management of hazardous substances,  reporting releases of hazardous
substances,  and establishing the necessary  contracts and agreements to conduct
cleanup.  Customarily, the parties involved will work with the EPA and under the
direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site
remediation.

Employees

     The number of persons  employed by the Company as of February  28, 2005 was
approximately 7,800 compared to 7,200 at December 31, 2003. This increase in the
number of employees was due to the addition of approximately  700 employees from
the Western Pest acquisition. This increase in employees was partially offset by
the continued  transition to every-other-month  pest control service,  which has
resulted  in the need for fewer  technicians  along  with  other  organizational
changes, such as the move to regional call centers.

Recent Developments

     The Board of  Directors,  at its  quarterly  meeting on January  25,  2005,
authorized a three-for-two  stock split by the issuance on March 10, 2005 of one
additional  common  share for each two common  shares held of record on February
10,  2005.  Accordingly,  the par value for  additional  shares  issued  will be
adjusted to common stock,  and fractional  shares resulting from the stock split
will be settled in cash. All share and per share data appearing  throughout this
Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted for this split.

     Also, at the same meeting, the Board of Directors authorized a 25% increase
in the Company's quarterly dividend. The increased regular quarterly dividend of
$0.05 per share, as adjusted for the stock split, will be payable March 10, 2005
to  stockholders  of record at the close of  business  February  10,  2005.  The
Company's new annual  dividend rate is $0.20 per share as adjusted for the stock
split.

Risk Factors

We may not be able to compete in the  competitive  and  technical  pest  control
industry in the future.

     We operate in a highly competitive industry.  Our revenues and earnings may
be affected by the following  factors:  changes in competitive  prices,  weather
related issues, general economic issues and governmental regulation.  We compete
with other  large pest  control  companies,  as well as  numerous  smaller  pest
control  companies  for a  finite  number  of  customers.  We  believe  that the
principal  competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are product and
service quality and availability,  reputation for safety,  technical proficiency
and price. Although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and
quality service is excellent,  we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain
our competitive position.

We  may  not  be  able  to  identify,   complete  or  successfully   consolidate
acquisitions.

     Acquisitions  have been and will continue to be an important element of our
business strategy. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire
acceptable  acquisition  candidates on terms  favorable to us in the future.  We
cannot assure that we will be able to  consolidate  successfully  the operations
and assets of any acquired business with our own business.  Any inability on our
part to consolidate and manage the growth from acquired  businesses could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

     Our operations are directly  affected by the weather  conditions across the
United  States and  Canada.  The  business  of the  Company is  affected  by the
seasonal nature of the Company's pest and termite control services. The increase
in pest pressure and activity,  as well as the  metamorphosis of termites in the
spring and summer (the  occurrence  of which is  determined by the timing of the
change in seasons),  has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and
income of the Company's pest and termite control operations during such periods.

Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential
and profitability.

     Our ability to remain  productive and profitable will depend  substantially
on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers.  Our ability to expand our
operations is in part  impacted by our ability to increase our labor force.  The
demand  for  skilled  employees  is high,  and the  supply  is very  limited.  A
significant  increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a
reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates paid by us, or
both. If either of these events occurred,  our capacity and profitability  could
be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

Our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.

     In the  normal  course of  business,  Orkin is a  defendant  in a number of
lawsuits,  including Butland et al. v. Orkin Exterminating  Company, Inc. et al.
pending in the  Circuit  Court of  Hillsborough  County,  Tampa,  Florida  which
alleges  that  plaintiffs  have been  damaged  as a result of the  rendering  of
services by Orkin personnel and equipment.  Orkin is actively  contesting  these
actions.  Some  lawsuits have been filed (Ernest W. Warren and Dolores G. Warren
et al. v. Orkin Exterminating  Company,  Inc., et al.; Francis D. Petsch, et al.
v.  Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc.  et al.;  and Bob J.  Stevens  v. Orkin
Exterminating  Company,  Inc. and  Rollins,  Inc.) in which the  Plaintiffs  are
seeking  certification of a class. The cases originate in Georgia,  Florida, and
Texas.  Additionally,  arbitration has been filed in Jacksonville,  Florida,  by
Cynthia  Garrett  against Orkin  (Cynthia  Garrett v. Orkin,  Inc.) in which the
plaintiff  is seeking  certification  of a class.  The  Company  believes  these
matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest  certification and
defend itself  through  trial or  arbitration,  if necessary.  In the opinion of
Management, the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.



Our  operations  may be  adversely  affected  if we are  unable to  comply  with
regulatory and environmental laws.

     Our  business is  significantly  affected by  environmental  laws and other
regulations  relating to the pest  control  industry and by changes in such laws
and the level of enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of
enforcement of existing laws and regulations,  how such laws and regulations may
be interpreted by enforcement  agencies or court rulings,  or whether additional
laws  and  regulations  will be  adopted.  We  believe  our  present  operations
substantially  comply with applicable  federal and state  environmental laws and
regulations.  We also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material
adverse effect on our operations to date.  However,  such environmental laws are
changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in
the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition.  Penalties
for noncompliance with these laws may include  cancellation of licenses,  fines,
and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial
results.

Item 2. Properties.

     The Company's administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are
located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The Company owns or
leases  several  hundred  branch  offices and operating  facilities  used in its
business as well as the Rollins  Training  Center  located in Atlanta,  Georgia.
None of the branch  offices,  individually  considered,  represents a materially
important  physical  property of the Company.  The  facilities  are suitable and
adequate to meet the  current and  reasonably  anticipated  future  needs of the
Company.  The Company  acquired and now owns 15 new branch  locations as part of
the Western acquisition, as well as 13 that are leased.

     On April 28,  2004,  the  Company  sold real estate in  Okeechobee  County,
Florida to LOR, Inc., a company  controlled by R. Randall  Rollins,  Chairman of
the  Board of  Rollins,  Inc.  and Gary W.  Rollins,  Chief  Executive  Officer,
President  and Chief  Operating  Officer of Rollins,  Inc. for $16.6  million in
cash.  The sale  resulted  in a net gain after tax of $8.1  million or $0.11 per
share since the real estate had appreciated  over  approximately 30 years it had
been owned by the  Company.  The Company  deferred a portion of the gain pending
the  completion  of a survey that may result in the return of a small portion of
the proceeds. The real estate was under a lease agreement with annual rentals of
$131,939  that would have expired June 30,  2007.  On May 28, 2004,  the Company
sold real estate in Sussex  County,  Delaware to LOR, Inc. for $111,000 in cash.
The sale resulted in an  immaterial  net gain after tax. The Board of Directors,
at its  quarterly  meeting on January 27,  2004,  approved  the  formation  of a
committee  (the  "Committee")  made up of Messrs.  Bill J.  Dismuke and James B.
Williams,  who are  independent  directors,  to evaluate  the  transactions.  In
addition,  the Company on October 22, 2004 purchased real estate located at 2158
Piedmont  Road,  N.E.,  Atlanta,   Georgia  30324,  adjacent  to  the  Company's
headquarters,  from LOR, Inc. for $4.6 million. The Committee was furnished with
full  disclosure of the  transactions,  including  independent  appraisals,  and
determined  that the terms of the  transactions  were reasonable and fair to the
Company.  The Company sold an additional  piece of real estate in Sussex County,
Delaware to LOR,  Inc. or an entity  wholly owned by LOR, Inc. for $10.6 million
in cash. The transaction  took place on December 29, 2004 and resulted in a $6.3
million gain, net of costs and after taxes.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

     Orkin, one of the Company's  subsidiaries,  is a named defendant in Butland
et al. v. Orkin Exterminating  Company, Inc. et al. pending in the Circuit Court
of Hillsborough  County,  Tampa,  Florida. The plaintiffs filed suit in March of
1999 and are seeking monetary damages and injunctive  relief. The Court ruled in
early April 2002,  certifying  the class action  lawsuit  against  Orkin.  Orkin
appealed  this ruling to the Florida  Second  District  Court of Appeals,  which
remanded the case back to the trial court for further findings.  In December the
Court issued a new ruling  certifying the class action.  Orkin intends to appeal
this new ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals.  Orkin believes
this case to be without  merit and intends to defend itself  vigorously  through
trial, if necessary. At this time, the final outcome of the litigation cannot be
determined.  However,  in the opinion of Management,  the ultimate resolution of
this action will not have a material  adverse effect on the Company's  financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.



     Orkin was also a named  defendant  in Helen  Cutler and Mary Lewin v. Orkin
Exterminating  Company,  Inc. et al. in the  District  Court of Houston  County,
Alabama.  The plaintiffs in the above mentioned case filed suit in March of 1996
and were seeking  monetary  damages and injunctive  relief for alleged breach of
contract arising out of alleged missed or inadequate reinspections.  The parties
settled this matter and it is now concluded.  In the opinion of Management,  the
ultimate resolution of this action did not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     Orkin is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the
normal course of business. In the opinion of Management, the Company's liability
under any of these matters would not materially affect its financial  condition,
results of operations or liquidity.

     Additionally,  in the normal course of business,  Orkin is a defendant in a
number of lawsuits,  which allege that  plaintiffs have been damaged as a result
of the rendering of services by Orkin personnel and equipment. Orkin is actively
contesting  these  actions.  Some lawsuits have been filed (Ernest W. Warren and
Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating  Company,  Inc., et al.; Francis
D.  Petsch,  et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc.  et al.;  and Bob J.
Stevens v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc. and Rollins,  Inc.) in which the
Plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class. The cases originate in Georgia,
Florida, and Texas. An arbitration has also been filed in Jacksonville, Florida,
by Cynthia Garrett against Orkin (Cynthia  Garrett v. Orkin,  Inc.) in which the
plaintiff  is seeking  certification  of a class.  The  Company  believes  these
matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest  certification and
defend itself  through  trial or  arbitration,  if necessary.  In the opinion of
Management, the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

     The  following  summary  financial  data  of  Rollins  highlights  selected
financial data and should be read in conjunction  with the financial  statements
included elsewhere in this document.







Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
     of Operations.



General Operating Comments

     The  Company's  addition of Western  Pest  Services,  along with  continued
emphasis on customer retention and building recurring revenues,  was the primary
driver of revenue  growth of 16.0% in the fourth  quarter and 10.9% for the year
ended  December 31, 2004 as compared to the prior year periods,  despite  severe
weather from four hurricanes in Florida and other parts of the country in 2004.

     The  financial  results for the fourth  quarter and the twelve months ended
December  31,  2004 were  positively  impacted by the  continued  benefit of our
every-other-month  residential pest control service,  which was 80.8% of all new
residential  sales in the fourth  quarter,  Gold Medal premium  commercial  pest
control services, and termite directed liquid and baiting treatment.

     For the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company had net income of $13.9 million
compared  to net income of $4.8  million in the  fourth  quarter of 2003,  which
represents a 187.4% increase.  In addition to the revenue increase of 16.0%, the
Company  achieved  margin  improvement  in  Cost  of  Services  Provided  of 0.4
percentage  points  and  Sales,  General  and  Administrative  Expenses  of  1.4
percentage  points,  expressed as a percentage  of  revenues.  In addition,  the
effective income tax rate was 38.7% in the fourth quarter of 2004 as compared to
52.4% in fourth quarter of 2003.



     For the year ended  December  31, 2004,  the Company had income  before the
change in accounting  principle of $58.3 million compared to net income of $35.8
million in 2003, which  represents a 62.9% increase.  In addition to the revenue
increase of 10.9%,  the Company  achieved  margin  improvements,  expressed as a
percentage of revenues,  in Cost of Services  Provided of 0.9 percentage  points
and in Sales, General and Administrative of 0.4 percentage points.

     For the year ended  December  31,  2004,  the  Company's  cash,  short-term
investments and marketable  securities declined by $24.7 million,  mainly due to
the $110  million  cash  purchase of Western  Pest  Services in April 2004.  The
Company  had  total  Cash and  Short-Term  Investments  of $56.7  million  as of
December 31, 2004, a 30.3% decrease from December 31, 2003.

     The Company  began its Orkin  franchise  program in the U.S.  in 1994,  and
established its first  international  franchise in Mexico in 2000 and its second
international  franchise in Panama in 2003.  At December 31, 2004,  Orkin had 49
franchises in total as compared to 44 as of December 31, 2003. Subsequently, the
Company opened two more  franchises on January 1, 2005 to expand our total to 51
franchises.

Results of Operations--2004 Versus 2003

     Revenues  for the year ended  December  31,  2004 were $750.9  million,  an
increase of $73.9 million or 10.9% from last year's  revenues of $677.0 million.
The Company's  acquisition of Western Pest Services  increased  Revenue by $49.0
million for the year. The Company's historical business prior to the acquisition
of Western  Pest was $701.4  million for the year, a $23.4  million  increase or
3.5% compared to 2003. The Company's historical business information is included
for core  business  comparisons  to the prior  year.  The  Company's  Commercial
revenue growth  increased 18%, due primarily to the  acquisition of Western Pest
Services,  better  customer  retention  in Orkin's U.S.  operations,  and strong
growth in its  Canadian  business  operations.  The  Company's  commercial  pest
control division  continued to receive favorable  reaction to the rollout of its
premium Gold Medal  service,  which  specifically  targets food  processing  and
manufacturing companies. Residential pest control revenues rose by 9.4% in 2004,
helped by the Western  acquisition  as well growth in the  customer  base,  4.8%
growth in units sold, better average selling prices,  continued  improvements in
customer   retention,   and  successful  price  increase  campaigns  in  Orkin's
operations.  Every-other-month  service,  our primary  residential  pest control
service  offering,  continues to grow in importance,  comprising over 60% of our
residential pest control customer base at December 31, 2004.

     Termite  revenues  increased  by 3.4% for the year ended  December 31, 2004
primarily due to the addition of Western Pest Services. Orkin's termite revenues
declined slightly due to loss in customer base from the expiration of fixed-term
contracts  and lower unit sales,  partially  offset by slightly  higher  average
selling prices.

     The Company's foreign operations  accounted for approximately 6.5% of total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 6.3% in 2003.

     The  business  of the Company is  affected  by the  seasonal  nature of the
Company's  pest  and  termite  control  services.  In  addition,  revenues  were
favorably  impacted in 2004 after the  acquisition  of Western Pest  Services on
April 30, 2004.

     Cost of Services  Provided for the year ended  December 31, 2004  increased
$32.9 million or 9.1%,  although the expense margin expressed as a percentage of
revenues improved by 0.9 percentage  points,  representing 52.6% of revenues for
the year ended  December  31,  2004  compared  to 53.5% of revenues in the prior
year.  The  dollar  increase  was  mainly due to the  addition  of Western  Pest
Services,  which  accounted for $30.2 million of the total, as well as increases
in service salaries, fleet expenses due to higher fuel costs, and fringe benefit
costs due to higher group medical insurance and pension costs,  partially offset
by improvements in insurance and claims costs.  Service technician  productivity
and average pay continued to improve,  which leads to better employee  retention
and, in Management's opinion, improved customer retention.

     Sales,  General and  Administrative  for the year ended  December  31, 2004
increased  $22.4 million or 9.5% while  improving as a percentage of revenues by
0.4 percentage  points,  averaging 34.5% of total revenues compared to 34.9% for
the  prior  year.  The  increase  for the year  was  primarily  a result  of the
acquisition  of  Western  Pest  Services,  which was $16.4  million,  as well as
increases in  administrative  salaries,  fringe benefits,  fleet costs,  travel,
advertising  and  promotions,  bad debts and  maintenance  and repairs and other
expenses.


     Depreciation and Amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004
were $23.0 million or 14.1% higher than the prior year.  The increase was due to
the acquisition of Western Pest Services, which accounted for $4.5 million while
depreciation  decreased  in other  areas as  assets  continue  to  become  fully
depreciated  and amortized at a faster rate than new capital  expenditures.  The
Company had approximately $14.2 million in capital  expenditures during the year
ended December 31, 2004 compared to $10.6 million in 2003.

     In  addition,  the  Company  realized a net gain of $24.7  million,  before
income  taxes,  from the sale or disposal of assets for the year ended  December
31, 2004, as compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

     The  Company's  effective tax rate was 40.5% for the first quarter of 2004,
42.7% for the second  quarter,  40.5% for the third  quarter,  and 38.7% for the
fourth  quarter.  As a result,  the effective tax rate for the year increased to
41.0%, as compared to 40.4% in 2003.

Results of Operations--2003 Versus 2002

     Revenues  for the year ended  December  31,  2003 were $677.0  million,  an
increase  of $11.6  million  or 1.7% from the prior  year's  revenues  of $665.4
million.  The  Company's  revenue  growth was very  similar  across its  primary
services,  which are  residential  pest control,  commercial  pest control,  and
termite  service.  The growth in pest control  revenues  for the year  reflected
growth  in  the  customer  base,   better  average  selling  prices,   continued
improvements in customer  retention,  and successful  price increase  campaigns.
Every-other-month   service,   our  primary  residential  pest  control  service
offering,  continued to grow in importance,  comprising  55% of our  residential
pest control customer base at December 31, 2003. In commercial pest control, the
Company  continued to receive  favorable  reaction to the rollout of its premium
Gold Medal service, which specifically targets food processing and manufacturing
companies,  and also achieved  improvements  in average  prices on new sales and
successful price increases from existing customers. In the summer of 2003, Orkin
began test marketing a mosquito  control  program in the northern  United States
and Canada.  While working to address the threat of  mosquito-borne  diseases in
the U.S.,  a highly  successful  West Nile virus  preventative  program was also
implemented  in Ontario,  Canada.  Two  provinces  were  provided  thousands  of
larvicide  treatments to mosquito  breeding  grounds  reducing the population of
adult  mosquitoes  and their eggs.  The Company  expanded the  mosquito  control
program in Canada and other U.S.  markets in the spring of 2004. As another sign
of strengthening in the commercial market, the Company achieved a monthly record
high of sales to national accounts in September 2003.

     Termite revenues  increased in the fourth quarter as a result of higher new
job completions and continued growth in recurring  revenues from bait monitoring
and renewal  revenues,  although  termite  revenues for the twelve  months ended
December 31, 2003  decreased  slightly,  mainly as a result of the unusually wet
and  cold  weather  in  parts of the U.S.  in the  first  half of 2003.  Per the
National Climatic Data Center's 109 years of tracking weather data, temperatures
in the Northeast Region of the country were the 10th coldest on record,  and the
Southeast  experienced  the  second  wettest  six month  period on  record.  The
Company's foreign operations  accounted for approximately 6.3% of total revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2003.

     Cost of Services  Provided for the year ended  December 31, 2003  increased
$1.1 million or 0.3%,  although the expense margin  expressed as a percentage of
revenues improved by 0.8 percentage  points,  representing 53.5% of revenues for
the year ended  December  31,  2003  compared  to 54.3% of revenues in the prior
year. The dollar increase was mainly due to an increase in fleet expenses,  as a
result of higher fuel costs and a temporary spike in vehicle counts in the first
quarter as the Company transitioned to a new fleet agreement, and an increase in
fringe benefit costs due to higher  pension and group medical  costs,  partially
offset  by  improvements  in  service  salaries,  administrative  salaries,  and
materials  and  supplies.   Service  technician  productivity  and  average  pay
continued  to  improve,  which  leads  to  better  employee  retention  and,  in
Management's opinion, improved customer retention.

     Sales,  General and  Administrative  for the year ended  December  31, 2003
decreased $1.7 million or 0.7% and, as a percentage of revenues, improved by 0.9
percentage  points or 2.5%,  averaging 34.9% of total revenues compared to 35.8%
for the prior year. The improvement for the year was a result of the home office
process improvement initiative started in 2002, lower field administrative costs
as a result of technology and  organizational  investments,  lower sales payroll
due to lower  staffing and partly from the  formation of in-bound  call centers,
and lower bad debt expenses due to better  collections  and  improvement  in the
receivables  aging  statistics.  These were  partially  offset by higher  fringe
benefit costs, advertising, and an increase in the summer sales program costs.


     Depreciation and Amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003
were $1.5  million or 6.7% lower than the prior year.  The  decrease  was due to
certain technology assets becoming fully depreciated in of 2003. The Company had
approximately  $10.6  million  in  capital  expenditures  during  the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to $10.4 million in 2002.

     In addition,  the Company realized a net gain of $1.7 million from the sale
or disposal of assets in the fourth quarter of 2003.

     The  Company's  effective  tax rate was 38.0% for the periods  prior to the
fourth quarter of 2003. The effective tax rate was increased to 40.4% in 2003 to
reflect an increase in the effective state income tax rate for the year, as well
as "true up" adjustments in the fourth quarter of approximately $1.1 million. As
a result, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter increased to 52.4%.

Related Party Transactions

     On April 28,  2004,  the  Company  sold real estate in  Okeechobee  County,
Florida to LOR, Inc., a company  controlled by R. Randall  Rollins,  Chairman of
the  Board of  Rollins,  Inc.  and Gary W.  Rollins,  Chief  Executive  Officer,
President  and Chief  Operating  Officer of Rollins,  Inc. for $16.6  million in
cash.  The sale  resulted  in a net gain after tax of $8.1  million or $0.11 per
share since the real estate had appreciated  over  approximately 30 years it had
been owned by the  Company.  The Company  deferred a portion of the gain pending
the  completion  of a survey that may result in the return of a small portion of
the proceeds. The real estate was under a lease agreement with annual rentals of
$131,939  that would have expired June 30,  2007.  On May 28, 2004,  the Company
sold real estate in Sussex  County,  Delaware to LOR, Inc. for $111,000 in cash.
The sale resulted in an  immaterial  net gain after tax. The Board of Directors,
at its  quarterly  meeting on January 27,  2004,  approved  the  formation  of a
committee  (the  "Committee")  made up of Messrs.  Bill J.  Dismuke and James B.
Williams,  who are  independent  directors,  to evaluate  the  transactions.  In
addition,  the Company on October 22, 2004 purchased real estate located at 2158
Piedmont  Road,  N.E.,  Atlanta,   Georgia  30324,  adjacent  to  the  Company's
headquarters,  from LOR, Inc. for $4.6 million. The Committee was furnished with
full  disclosure of the  transactions,  including  independent  appraisals,  and
determined  that the terms of the  transactions  were reasonable and fair to the
Company.  The Company sold an additional  piece of real estate in Sussex County,
Delaware to LOR,  Inc. or an entity  wholly owned by LOR, Inc. for $10.6 million
in cash. The transaction  took place on December 29, 2004 and resulted in a $6.3
million gain, net of costs and after taxes.

Critical Accounting Policies

     We view  critical  accounting  policies to be those  policies that are very
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations,
and that require Management's most difficult,  complex or subjective  judgments.
The circumstances  that make these judgments  difficult or complex relate to the
need for  Management  to make  estimates  about the effect of  matters  that are
inherently  uncertain.  We believe  our  critical  accounting  policies to be as
follows:

     Accrual  for  Termite  Contracts--  The  Company  maintains  an accrual for
     termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,  repairs
     and  associated  labor and chemicals,  settlements,  awards and other costs
     relative to termite control  services.  Factors that may impact future cost
     include  chemical  life  expectancy  and  government   regulation.   It  is
     significant  that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years
     due to changes in the  Company's  business  practices.  However,  it is not
     possible to precisely predict future significant  claims.  Positive changes
     to our business  practices  include  revisions made to our contracts,  more
     effective  treatment  methods  that include a  directed-liquid  and baiting
     program, more effective termiticides, and expanding training.

     Accrued  Insurance--  The Company  self-insures,  up to  specified  limits,
     certain  risks  related to general  liability,  workers'  compensation  and
     vehicle liability.  The estimated costs of existing and future claims under
     the  self-insurance  program are accrued  based upon  historical  trends as
     incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement
     of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently
     revised  based  on  developments  relating  to  such  claims.  The  Company
     contracts an independent  third party actuary on an annual basis to provide
     the  Company  an  estimated   liability   based  upon   historical   claims
     information.  The  actuarial  study is a major  consideration,  along  with
     Management's knowledge of


     changes in  business  practices  and  existing  claims  compared to current
     balances. The reserve is established based on all these factors. Due to the
     uncertainty  associated  with the  estimation  of future  loss and  expense
     payments and inherent limitations of the data, actual developments may vary
     from the Company's  projections.  This is particularly  true since critical
     assumptions  regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are
     largely  based  upon  judgment.  Therefore,  changes  in  estimates  may be
     sufficiently material. Management's judgment is inherently subjective and a
     number  of  factors  are  outside   Management's   knowledge  and  control.
     Additionally,  historical  information is not always an accurate indication
     of future  events.  It should be noted  that the  number of claims has been
     decreasing due to the Company's  proactive  risk  management to develop and
     maintain ongoing programs.  Initiatives that have been implemented  include
     pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all
     its drivers, utilization of a Global Positioning System that has been fully
     deployed to our Company vehicles,  post-offer  physicals for new employees,
     and  pre-hire,  random and  post-accident  drug  testing.  The  Company has
     improved  the time  required  to report a claim by  utilizing a "Red Alert"
     program that provides serious accident  assessment  twenty four hours a day
     and seven days a week and has  instituted  a  modified  duty  program  that
     enables employees to go back to work on a limited-duty basis.

     Revenue  Recognition--  The  Company's  revenue  recognition  policies  are
     designed to  recognize  revenues at the time  services are  performed.  For
     certain revenue types,  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of
     cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates
     are  utilized.   Residential  and  commercial  pest  control  services  are
     primarily  recurring  in nature on a monthly  or  bi-monthly  basis,  while
     certain  types of  commercial  customers  may receive  multiple  treatments
     within a given month.  In general,  pest control  customers sign an initial
     one-year  contract,  and revenues are  recognized  at the time services are
     performed.  For pest control  customers,  the Company offers a discount for
     those customers who prepay for a full year of services.  The Company defers
     recognition  of these advance  payments and  recognizes  the revenue as the
     services are rendered.  The Company classifies the discounts related to the
     advance  payments as a reduction in revenues.  Termite baiting revenues are
     recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting.  At
     the  inception of a new baiting  services  contract  upon  quality  control
     review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery
     of the monitoring stations,  initial directed liquid termiticide  treatment
     and  installation  of the monitoring  services.  The amount deferred is the
     fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service.
     The  amount  deferred  for  the  undelivered  monitoring  element  is  then
     recognized as income on a straight-line  basis over the remaining  contract
     term,   which  results  in   recognition  of  revenue  in  a  pattern  that
     approximates the timing of performing  monitoring  visits.  Baiting renewal
     revenue is deferred and  recognized  over the annual  contract  period on a
     straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required
     monitoring visits.

          Prior to 2004,  traditional  termite  treatments  were  recognized  as
     revenue at the renewal date and an accrual was  established  for  estimated
     costs of reapplications and repairs to be incurred. Under the newly adopted
     accounting  method,  the revenue  received is deferred and  recognized on a
     straight-line  basis over the  remaining  contract  term;  and, the cost of
     reinspections,   reapplications   and  repairs  and  associated  labor  and
     chemicals are expensed as incurred.  For outstanding claims, an estimate is
     made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current
     factors and historical information.  The performance of reinspections tends
     to be close to the contract  renewal  date and,  while  reapplications  and
     repairs involve an insubstantial  number of the contracts,  these costs are
     incurred over the contract  term.  The newly adopted  accounting  principle
     eliminates the need to obtain actuarial  estimates of the claim costs to be
     incurred  and  management's   estimates  of  reapplication   costs.   Also,
     management  believes  the newly  adopted  accounting  method  more  closely
     conforms  to the  current  pattern  under  which  revenues  are  earned and
     expenses are incurred, and conforms the accounting methodology of Orkin and
     its  recently  acquired  subsidiary,  Western Pest  Services.  The costs of
     providing  termite  services  upon  renewal are  compared  to the  expected
     revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

          Due to this change,  the Company  recorded a cumulative  adjustment of
     $6.2 million (net of income taxes).  As the revenue is being deferred,  the
     future cost of  reinspections,  reapplications  and repairs and  associated
     labor and  chemicals  applicable  to the  deferred  revenue are expensed as
     incurred and no longer  accrued.  The Company  will  continue to accrue for
     noticed claims.


     Contingency  Accruals--  The Company is a party to legal  proceedings  with
     respect to matters in the ordinary  course of business.  In accordance with
     Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  5,  Accounting  for
     Contingencies,  the Company  estimates  and accrues for its  liability  and
     costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined
     in  consultation  with outside  counsel.  It is not possible to  accurately
     predict the ultimate result of the litigation.  However,  in the opinion of
     Management,  the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse
     impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

     Stock-Based  Compensation--  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
     (revised 2004),  "Share-Based  Payment" ("SFAS 123R"),  which replaces SFAS
     No.  123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,"  ("SFAS  123") and
     supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."
     SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,  including grants
     of employee  stock  options,  to be recognized in the financial  statements
     based on their  fair  values  beginning  with the first  interim  or annual
     period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption  encouraged.  The pro forma
     disclosures  previously  permitted  under  SFAS  123 no  longer  will be an
     alternative  to  financial  statement  recognition.  Rollins is required to
     adopt SFAS 123R in the third  quarter  of fiscal  2005,  beginning  July 1,
     2005.  Under SFAS 123R,  Rollins must determine the appropriate  fair value
     model to be used for valuing share-based payments,  the amortization method
     for  compensation  cost  and the  transition  method  to be used at date of
     adoption.  The  transition  methods  include  prospective  and  retroactive
     adoption  options.  Under the  retroactive  option,  prior  periods  may be
     restated  either as of the  beginning  of the year of  adoption  or for all
     periods  presented.  The  prospective  method  requires  that  compensation
     expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted  stock at
     the  beginning  of the first  quarter of adoption  of SFAS 123R,  while the
     retroactive  methods  would  record  compensation  expense for all unvested
     stock  options  and  restricted  stock  beginning  with  the  first  period
     restated.  Rollins is evaluating the  requirements of SFAS 123R and expects
     that the adoption of SFAS 123R will not have a material  impact on Rollins'
     consolidated  results of operations and earnings per share. Rollins has not
     yet  determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R,
     and it has not determined  whether the adoption will result in amounts that
     are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



     The Company  believes  its current  cash  balances,  future cash flows from
operating  activities and available  borrowings  under its $70.0 million line of
credit will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and
fund  expansion  of the  business  for the  foreseeable  future.  The  Company's
operations generated cash of $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004,
compared with cash provided by operating activities of $60.3 million in 2003 and
$53.7 million in 2002.

     The Company invested  approximately  $14.2 million in capital  expenditures
during the year ended  December  31,  2004.  Capital  expenditures  for the year
consisted primarily of the purchase of property at 2158 Piedmont Road as well as
equipment replacements and upgrades and improvements to the Company's management
information  systems.  The Company  expects to invest  between $10.0 million and
$14.0 million in 2005 in capital expenditures. During the year, the Company made
several  acquisitions  totaling  $98.1 million  compared to $1.5 million  during
2003. The acquisitions were funded primarily with cash from operations and a $15
million  loan taken for the Western Pest  acquisition.  The $15 million was paid
within the same month from cash provided from operations.  The Company continues
to seek new  acquisitions  and will also give  consideration  to any  attractive
acquisition  opportunities  presented. A total of $10.9 million was paid in cash
dividends ($0.04 per share a quarter) during the



year,  compared to $9.0 million or $0.03 per share a quarter  during  2003.  The
Company  repurchased  57,000  shares  of Common  Stock in 2004 and there  remain
917,526 shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board authorization. The
Company  maintains $70.0 million of credit  facilities with commercial banks, of
which no  borrowings  were  outstanding  as of December 31, 2004 or February 15,
2005.  The Company  maintains  approximately  $34.5 million in Letters of Credit
which reduced its borrowing capacity under the credit facilities.  These Letters
of Credit are required by the  Company's  fronting  insurance  companies  and/or
certain  states,  due to the Company's  self-funded  status,  to secure  various
workers' compensation and casualty insurance contracts.  These letters of credit
are established by the bank for the Company's  fronting  insurance  companies as
collateral,  although the Company  believes that it has adequate  liquid assets,
funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

     Orkin, one of the Company's subsidiaries, is aggressively defending a class
action lawsuit filed in  Hillsborough  County,  Tampa,  Florida.  In early April
2002, the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County certified the class action status
of Butland et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc. et al. Other  lawsuits
against  Orkin,  and in some  instances the Company,  are also being  vigorously
defended,  including  the  Warren,  Petsch,  and  Stevens  cases and the Garrett
arbitration.  For further discussion,  see Note 7 to the accompanying  financial
statements.

     The Company  made a  contribution  of $3.0  million to its defined  benefit
retirement  plan (the  "Plan")  during  2004 as a result of the  Plan's  funding
status.  The Company  believes that it will make  contributions in the amount of
approximately  $4.0  million  to  $6.0  million  in  2005.  In  the  opinion  of
Management, additional Plan contributions will not have a material effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     The decline in the Accrual for Termite  Contracts of $18.6 million or 42.3%
is reflective of the change in accounting  principle as well as  improvement  in
the experience  rate.  The number of new termite  claims  declined for the sixth
year in a row and was 19.6%  lower  than  2003,  which is a result  of  improved
treatment techniques,  more effective termiticides,  shorter-term guarantees and
quality  assurance  initiatives.  For  further  discussion,  see  Note  6 to the
accompanying  financial statements.  Accrued Insurance decreased $1.4 million or
3.7% during the year as a result of improved  experience  rate,  attributable to
the Company's proactive management of issues associated with self-insured risks.

Contractual Obligations

     The impact that the Company's  contractual  obligations  as of December 31,
2004 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as
follows:



Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

       In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which is effective for revenue
arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The
Company adopted EITF 00-21 in the third quarter of 2003. This EITF addresses how
to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple
products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The Company's termite baiting
service involves multiple deliverables, consisting of an initial directed liquid
termiticide treatment, installation of termite monitoring stations, and
subsequent periodic monitoring inspections. The portion of the termite baiting
service sales price applicable to subsequent periodic monitoring inspections,
which is determined based on fair value, is deferred and recognized over the
first year of each contract. The portion of the sales price



applicable to the  termiticide  treatment  and  installation  of the  monitoring
services is determined under the residual method (the total sales price less the
fair  value  of the  monitoring  inspections).  Revenues  from  the  termiticide
treatment and  installation  of the termite  monitoring  stations are recognized
upon performance of the service and installation.  The adoption of this EITF did
not have a significant effect on the Company's  financial  position,  results of
operations or liquidity.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued  Interpretation No. 46,  Consolidation of
Variable  Interest  Entities  ("FIN 46").  The  Interpretation  requires  that a
variable interest entity be consolidated by a company if that company is subject
to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities
or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's  residual returns or both. The
consolidation  requirements  of FIN 46 are effective  for all variable  interest
entities  created or acquired  after  January 31, 2003.  In December  2003,  the
Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued a revision to FIN 46 referred to as
Interpretation  No. 46 (R). Among other  provisions,  the revision  extended the
adoption date of FIN 46 (R) to the first  quarter of 2004 for variable  interest
entities created prior to February 1, 2003. During 2003, the Company adopted FIN
46 with respect to variable  interest  entities  created after January 31, 2003.
The  Company  adopted  FIN 46 (R) in the  first  quarter  of 2004  for  variable
interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003. The adoption did not have a
significant effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

     In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based
Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,"  ("SFAS 123") and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for
Stock  Issued to  Employees."  SFAS 123R  requires all  share-based  payments to
employees,  including grants of employee stock options,  to be recognized in the
financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim
or annual period after June 15, 2005,  with early adoption  encouraged.  The pro
forma  disclosures  previously  permitted  under  SFAS 123 no longer  will be an
alternative  to financial  statement  recognition.  Rollins is required to adopt
SFAS 123R in the third  quarter of fiscal 2005,  beginning  July 1, 2005.  Under
SFAS 123R,  Rollins must determine the  appropriate  fair value model to be used
for valuing share-based payments,  the amortization method for compensation cost
and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods
include  prospective and  retroactive  adoption  options.  Under the retroactive
option,  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of
adoption or for all periods  presented.  The  prospective  method  requires that
compensation  expense be recorded for all unvested  stock options and restricted
stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R,  while the
retroactive  methods would record  compensation  expense for all unvested  stock
options and restricted stock beginning with the first period  restated.  Rollins
is  evaluating  the  requirements  of SFAS 123R and expects that the adoption of
SFAS 123R will not have a material  impact on Rollins'  consolidated  results of
operations and earnings per share.  Rollins has not yet determined the method of
adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, and it has not determined  whether
the  adoption  will result in amounts  that are similar to the current pro forma
disclosures under SFAS 123.

Forward-Looking Statements

     This Annual Report contains  forward-looking  statements within the meaning
of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such  forward-looking
statements include statements  regarding the expected impact of potential future
pension  plan   contributions,   future   contributions  of  Western,   expected
contributions of the commercial business segment,  and the outcome of litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business and the outcome of the Butland et al.
v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc.  et al.  ("Butland")  litigation  on the
Company's financial position,  results of operations and liquidity; the adequacy
of the Company's  resources to fund  operations and  obligations;  the Company's
projected   2005  capital   expenditures;   the  impact  of  recent   accounting
pronouncements;  the expected outcome of the growth of national account revenue.
The actual results of the Company could differ  materially  from those indicated
by  the  forward-looking   statements  because  of  various  risks,  timing  and
uncertainties  including,  without  limitation,  the  possibility  of an adverse
ruling against the Company in the Butland or other litigation;  general economic
conditions;  market risk;  changes in industry  practices or  technologies;  the
degree of success of the  Company's  termite  process  reforms and pest  control
selling and  treatment  methods;  the  Company's  ability to identify  potential
acquisitions;  climate  and  weather  trends;  competitive  factors  and pricing
practices; potential increases in labor costs; and changes in various government
laws and regulations,  including environmental regulations. All of the foregoing
risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in
many cases the Company  cannot  predict the risks and  uncertainties  that could
cause its  actual  results to differ  materially  from  those  indicated  by the
forward-looking statements.


Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market Risk

     As of December 31, 2004,  the Company  maintained an  investment  portfolio
subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company has been affected
by the impact of lower  interest  rates on interest  income from its  short-term
investments.  The Company is also subject to interest rate risk exposure through
borrowings  on its $70.0  million  credit  facility.  Due to the absence of such
borrowings as of December 31, 2004, this risk was not significant in 2004 and is
not expected to have a material effect upon the Company's  results of operations
or  financial  position  going  forward.  However,  the  Company  does  maintain
approximately $34.5 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is also exposed to
market  risks  arising  from  changes in foreign  exchange  rates.  The  Company
believes that this foreign  exchange  rate risk will not have a material  effect
upon the Company's results of operations or financial position going forward.



Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.


























Supplemental Disclosures of Non-Cash Items

Pension--Non-cash  (increases)  decreases in the minimum pension liability which
were  (charged)  credited to other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  were  $(32.1)
million, $26.1 million and $(19.9) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Significant  Acquisition--  The Company  purchased all of the assets and assumed
certain  liabilities  of Western Pest Services  ("Western").  The fair values of
Western's assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition are presented below:

               Real Estate                 $  11,170

     The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial
statements.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business  Description--Rollins,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is a  national  service
company  with  headquarters  located in  Atlanta,  Georgia,  providing  pest and
termite control services to both residential and commercial customers.

     Orkin, Inc. ("Orkin"),  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company founded in
1901,  is one of the world's  largest  pest and termite  control  companies.  It
provides  customized  services  from over 400  locations  to  approximately  1.6
million  customers.  Orkin serves  customers in the United States,  Canada,  and
Mexico, providing essential pest control services and protection against termite
damage,  rodents and insects to homes and  businesses,  including  hotels,  food
service  establishments,   food  manufacturers,   retailers  and  transportation
companies.   Orkin  operates  under  the  Orkin(R)  and  PCO  Services,  Inc.(R)
trademarks and the AcuridSM service mark.

     On April 30, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed  certain  liabilities  of Western  Pest  Services  ("Western"),  and the
Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  include the operating results of
Western from the date of the acquisition.

     The Company has only one reportable  segment,  its pest and termite control
business.  The Company's  results of operations and its financial  condition are
not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company's foreign
operations.



Principles  of  Consolidation--The   Company's  policy  is  to  consolidate  all
subsidiaries,  investees  or other  entities  where it has  voting  control,  is
subject to a majority  of the risk of loss or is  entitled to receive a majority
of residual  returns.  The Company does not have any  subsidiaries  or investees
where it has less than a 100% equity  interest or less than 100% voting control,
nor does it have any  interest  in other  investees,  joint  ventures,  or other
entities that require consolidation.

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of the Company
and subsidiaries owned by the Company.  All material  intercompany  accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Estimates Used in the  Preparation  of  Consolidated  Financial  Statements--The
preparation  of  the  consolidated   financial  statements  in  conformity  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States  of  America
requires  Management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
reported in the  accompanying  notes and financial  statements.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.

Revenues--The  Company's revenue recognition  policies are designed to recognize
revenues at the time services are performed.  For certain revenue types, because
of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing
services, certain accounting estimates are utilized.  Residential and commercial
pest  control  services  are  primarily  recurring  in nature  on a  monthly  or
bi-monthly  basis,  while  certain  types of  commercial  customers  may receive
multiple  treatments  within a given month. In general,  pest control  customers
sign an initial  one-year  contract,  and  revenues are  recognized  at the time
services  are  performed.  For pest  control  customers,  the  Company  offers a
discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company
defers  recognition of these advance  payments and recognizes the revenue as the
services are  rendered.  The Company  classifies  the  discounts  related to the
advance  payments as a reduction  in  revenues.  Termite  baiting  revenues  are
recognized based on the delivery of the individual  units of accounting.  At the
inception of a new baiting services  contract upon quality control review of the
installation,  the Company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring
stations,  initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the
monitoring  services.  The  amount  deferred  is the fair  value  of  monitoring
services to be rendered after the initial  service.  The amount deferred for the
undelivered  monitoring  element is then recognized as income on a straight-line
basis over the remaining  contract term, which results in recognition of revenue
in a pattern  that  approximates  the timing of  performing  monitoring  visits.
Baiting  renewal  revenue is deferred and  recognized  over the annual  contract
period on a straight-line  basis that  approximates the timing of performing the
required monitoring visits.

     Prior to 2004, traditional termite treatments were recognized as revenue at
the  renewal  date  and an  accrual  was  established  for  estimated  costs  of
reapplications  and repairs to be incurred.  Under the newly adopted  accounting
method, the revenue received is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis
over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications
and repairs and  associated  labor and chemicals  are expensed as incurred.  For
outstanding  claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred  (including
legal  costs)  based  upon  current  factors  and  historical  information.  The
performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and,
while  reapplications  and  repairs  involve  an  insubstantial  number  of  the
contracts,  these costs are incurred over the contract  term.  The newly adopted
accounting  principle  eliminates the need to obtain actuarial  estimates of the
claim costs to be incurred and management's  estimates of  reapplication  costs.
Also,  management  believes  the newly  adopted  accounting  method more closely
conforms to the current pattern under which revenues are earned and expenses are
incurred,  and conforms  the  accounting  methodology  of Orkin and its recently
acquired  subsidiary,  Western Pest  Services.  The costs of  providing  termite
services upon renewal are compared to the expected  revenue to be received and a
provision is made for any expected losses.

     Interest  income on  installment  receivables  is accrued  monthly based on
actual loan balances and stated  interest  rates.  Franchise fees are treated as
unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial  Position for the duration of the
initial  contract  period.  Royalties  from Orkin  franchises  are  accrued  and
recognized  as  revenues  as earned on a monthly  basis.  Gains on sales of pest
control  customer  accounts to franchises are recognized at the time of sale and
when collection is reasonably assured.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts--The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts based on the expected collectibility of accounts receivable.



Advertising--Advertising  expenses  are  charged to  expense  during the year in
which they are incurred.  The total advertising costs were  approximately  $33.4
million, $31.9 million and $30.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Cash and Short-Term  Investments--The  Company considers all investments with an
original  maturity of three  months or less to be cash  equivalents.  Short-term
investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.

Marketable  Securities--The  Company  maintains  investments  held with  several
large, well-capitalized financial institutions.  The Company's investment policy
does not allow investment in any securities  rated less than "investment  grade"
by national rating services.

     Management determines the appropriate  classification of debt securities at
the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet
date. Debt securities are classified as  available-for-sale  because the Company
does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity.  Available-for-sale
securities  are  stated at their  fair  values,  with the  unrealized  gains and
losses,  net of tax, reported as a separate  component of stockholders'  equity.
Realized  gains  and  losses  and  declines  in value  judged  to be other  than
temporary on available-for-sale  securities are included in interest income. The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest
and dividends on securities  classified  as  available-for-sale  are included in
interest income. The Company's marketable securities generally consist of United
States government,  corporate and municipal debt securities.  The Company had no
marketable securities as of December 31, 2004.

Materials and Supplies--Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Income  Taxes--The  Company  provides  for income  taxes based on  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 109,  Accounting  for Income Taxes,
which  requires  recognition  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and assets for the
expected  future  tax  consequences  of events  that have been  included  in the
consolidated financial statements or tax returns.

Equipment  and  Property--Depreciation  and  amortization,  which  includes  the
amortization of assets recorded under capital leases,  are provided  principally
on a straight-line  basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Annual  provisions for  depreciation of $12.1 million in 2004,  $13.3 million in
2003 and  $14.9  million  in  2002,  have  been  reflected  in the  Consolidated
Statements of Income in the line item entitled  Depreciation  and  Amortization.
These annual  provisions for depreciation are computed using the following asset
lives:  buildings,  ten to forty years; and furniture,  fixtures,  and operating
equipment,  three to ten years.  Expenditures for additions,  major renewals and
betterments  are capitalized  and  expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred.  The cost of assets  retired or otherwise  disposed of and
the related  accumulated  depreciation  and amortization are eliminated from the
accounts in the year of disposal  with the  resulting  gain or loss  credited or
charged to income.

Insurance--The  Company  self-insures,  up to specified  limits,  certain  risks
related to general liability,  workers' compensation and vehicle liability.  The
estimated costs of existing and future claims under the  self-insurance  program
are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or
unreported  (although  actual  settlement  of the  claims  may not be made until
future periods) and may be subsequently  revised based on developments  relating
to such claims.  The Company  contracts an independent third party actuary on an
annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical
claims  information.  The actuarial study is a major  consideration,  along with
Management's  knowledge  of changes in business  practice  and  existing  claims
compared  to current  balances.  The reserve is  established  based on all these
factors.  Management's judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors
are  outside  Management's  knowledge  and  control.  Additionally,   historical
information is not always an accurate indication of future events.

Accrual for Termite  Contracts--  The Company  maintains  an accrual for termite
claims   representing  the  estimated  costs  of  reapplications,   repairs  and
associated labor and chemicals,  settlements, awards and other costs relative to
termite  control   services.   Factors  that  may  impact  future  cost  include
termiticide  life expectancy and government  regulation.  It is significant that
the actual  number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the
Company's business  practices.  However, it is not possible to precisely predict
future  significant  claims.  Positive changes to our business practices include
revisions made to our contracts, more effective treatment methods that include a
directed-liquid  and baiting program,  more effective  termiticides and expanded
training.



Contingency  Accruals--The  Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect
to matters in the ordinary  course of business.  In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies,  the Company
estimates  and  accrues  for  its  liability  and  costs   associated  with  the
litigation.  Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation  with outside
counsel.  It is not possible to  accurately  predict the ultimate  result of the
litigation. However, in the opinion of Management, the outcome of the litigation
will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's  financial condition or
results of operations.

Treasury Shares--The Company records treasury stock repurchases at par value and
records the  difference  between cost and par value as a reduction of additional
paid-in-captial.  During 2004 57,000 shares were  repurchased  for $937,000.  No
shares were repurchased in 2003.

Earnings Per Share--In accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share ("EPS"),
the Company  presents  basic EPS and diluted  EPS.  Basic EPS is computed on the
basis of  weighted-average  shares  outstanding.  Diluted EPS is computed on the
basis  of   weighted-average   shares  outstanding  plus  common  stock  options
outstanding  during the year, which, if exercised,  would have a dilutive effect
on EPS.  Basic and  diluted  EPS for all years has been  restated  for the stock
split effective March 10, 2005 and March of 2003. A reconciliation of the number
of  weighted-average  shares  used in  computing  basic  and  diluted  EPS is as
follows:



Translation of Foreign Currencies--Assets and liabilities reported in functional
currencies  other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the year
end  rate  of  exchange.   Revenues  and   expenses   are   translated   at  the
weighted-average   exchange  rates  for  the  year.  The  resulting  translation
adjustments  are  charged or credited to other  comprehensive  income.  Gains or
losses from foreign  currency  transactions,  such as those  resulting  from the
settlement of  receivables  or payables  denominated  in foreign  currency,  are
included in the earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based   Compensation--As   permitted  by  SFAS  No.  123,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation,  the Company accounts for employee stock compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion  No.  25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees.  No  stock-based
employee  compensation  cost is reflected in net income,  as all options granted
under  those  plans  had an  exercise  price  equal to the  market  value of the
underlying  common stock on the date of grant.  The following table  illustrates
the effect on net income and  earnings  per share if the Company had applied the
fair value  recognition  provisions of FASB  Statement No. 123,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.










Comprehensive  Income  (Loss)--Other  Comprehensive  Income (Loss)  results from
foreign   currency   translations,   minimum  pension   liability   adjustments,
Nonqualified Stock Options (NSO) and unrealized loss on marketable securities.

New Accounting  Standards--  In November  2002,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force
issued EITF 00-21,  Revenue  Arrangements with Multiple  Deliverables,  which is
effective  for revenue  arrangements  entered into in fiscal  periods  beginning
after June 15,  2003.  The Company  adopted  EITF 00-21 in the third  quarter of
2003.  This EITF  addresses  how to account for  arrangements  that  involve the
delivery or performance  of multiple  products,  services,  and/or rights to use
assets.  The Company's termite baiting service involves  multiple  deliverables,
consisting of an initial directed liquid termiticide treatment,  installation of
termite monitoring stations, and subsequent periodic monitoring inspections. The
portion of the termite  baiting  service  sales price  applicable  to subsequent
periodic  monitoring  inspections,  which is determined  based on fair value, is
deferred and recognized over the first year of each contract. The portion of the
sales price  applicable to the  termiticide  treatment and  installation  of the
monitoring  services is  determined  under the residual  method (the total sales
price  less the fair value of the  monitoring  inspections).  Revenues  from the
termiticide  treatment and installation of the termite  monitoring  stations are
recognized  upon  performance of the service and  installation.  The adoption of
this EITF did not have a significant effect on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

In  December  2002,  the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 46,  Consolidation  of
Variable  Interest  Entities  ("FIN 46").  The  Interpretation  requires  that a
variable interest entity be consolidated by a company if that company is subject
to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities
or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's  residual returns or both. The
consolidation  requirements  of FIN 46 are effective  for all variable  interest
entities  created or acquired  after  January 31, 2003.  In December  2003,  the
Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued a revision to FIN 46 referred to as
Interpretation  No. 46 (R).  Among other  provisions,  the revision  extends the
adoption date of FIN 46 (R) to the first  quarter of 2004 for variable  interest
entities created prior to February 1,


2003. The adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46 (R) did not have a significant effect on
the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In December  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 123  (revised  2004),  "Share-Based
Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,"  ("SFAS 123") and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for
Stock  Issued to  Employees."  SFAS 123R  requires all  share-based  payments to
employees,  including grants of employee stock options,  to be recognized in the
financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim
or annual period after June 15, 2005,  with early adoption  encouraged.  The pro
forma  disclosures  previously  permitted  under  SFAS 123 no longer  will be an
alternative  to financial  statement  recognition.  Rollins is required to adopt
SFAS 123R in the third  quarter of fiscal 2005,  beginning  July 1, 2005.  Under
SFAS 123R,  Rollins must determine the  appropriate  fair value model to be used
for valuing share-based payments,  the amortization method for compensation cost
and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods
include  prospective and  retroactive  adoption  options.  Under the retroactive
option,  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of
adoption or for all periods  presented.  The  prospective  method  requires that
compensation  expense be recorded for all unvested  stock options and restricted
stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R,  while the
retroactive  methods would record  compensation  expense for all unvested  stock
options and restricted stock beginning with the first period  restated.  Rollins
is  evaluating  the  requirements  of SFAS 123R and expects that the adoption of
SFAS 123R will not have a material  impact on Rollins'  consolidated  results of
operations and earnings per share.  Rollins has not yet determined the method of
adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, and it has not determined  whether
the  adoption  will result in amounts  that are similar to the current pro forma
disclosures under SFAS 123.

Franchising Program--Franchising Program--Orkin had 49 franchises as of December
31, 2004, including international franchises in Mexico, established in 2000, and
Panama,  established  in 2003.  Transactions  with  franchises  involve sales of
customer  contracts to establish  new  franchises,  initial  franchise  fees and
royalties.  The customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically sold
for a combination of cash and notes due over periods  ranging up to 5 years.  As
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, notes receivable from franchises  aggregated $5.2
million and $3.9 million,  respectively.  The Company  recognizes gains from the
sale  of  customer  contracts  at the  time  they  are  sold to  franchises  and
collection on the notes is reasonably  assured,  which amounted to approximately
$1.7 million in 2004,  $2.2 million in 2003,  and $1.1 million in 2002,  and are
included as  revenues in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of Income.
Initial  franchise  fees are deferred  for the duration of the initial  contract
period and are included as unearned  revenue in the  Consolidated  Statements of
Financial  Position.  Deferred  franchise fees amounted to $1.6 million and $1.4
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  Royalties from franchises
are accrued and  recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly  basis.  Revenues
from royalties were $1.7 million in 2004, $1.4 million in 2003, and $1.2 million
in 2002.  The  Company's  maximum  exposure to loss  relating to the  franchises
aggregated  $3.6  million  and $2.5  million  in  December  31,  2004 and  2003,
respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments--The Company's financial instruments consist
of  cash,  short-term  investments,   marketable  securities,  trade  and  notes
receivables,  accounts  payable and other short-term  liabilities.  The carrying
amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values.

Reclassifications--Certain  amounts for previous years have been reclassified to
conform with the 2004 consolidated financial statement presentation.

Three-for-Two  Stock Split--The Board of Directors,  at its quarterly meeting on
January 25,  2004,  authorized  a  three-for-two  stock split by the issuance on
March 10, 2005 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of
record at February 10, 2005.  Accordingly,  the par value for additional  shares
issued will be adjusted to common stock,  and fractional  shares  resulting from
the stock split will be settled in cash.  All share and per share data appearing
in  the   consolidated   financial   statements  and  related  notes  have  been
retroactively adjusted for this split.

The Board of Directors, at its quarterly meeting on January 28, 2003, authorized
a three-for-two  stock split by the issuance on March 10, 2003 of one additional
common share for each two common shares held of record at February 10, 2003. All
share  and per  share  data for 2002  appearing  in the  consolidated  financial
statements  and related  notes have been  retroactively  adjusted for this stock
split.


2.   TRADE RECEIVABLES

     Trade receivables, net, at December 31, 2004, totaling $55.2 million and at
December 31, 2003,  totaling $48.5  million,  are net of allowances for doubtful
accounts  of $5.1  million and $4.6  million,  respectively.  Trade  receivables
include  installment  receivable  amounts,  which are due subsequent to one year
from the balance sheet dates.  These amounts were approximately $7.1 million and
$6.2 million at the end of 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  Trade receivables also
include notes  receivable due from franchises which amounted to $5.2 million and
$3.9 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The carrying amount
of notes receivable  approximates  fair value as the interest rates  approximate
market rates for these types of contracts.  The Allowance For Doubtful  Accounts
is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages
to  delinquency  aging  totals,  based on  contractual  terms,  for the  various
categories  of  receivables.  Bad debt  write-offs  occur  according  to company
policies that are specific to pest control,  commercial and termite accounts. At
any given  time,  the  Company  may have  immaterial  amounts  due from  related
parties, which are invoiced and settled on a regular basis. Receivables due from
related  parties  were  approximately  $46,000  as of  December  31,  2004,  and
approximately $55,000 as of December 31, 2003.

         -----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

     Intangibles  consist primarily of goodwill and customer  contracts and also
include  trademarks  and  non-compete  agreements,  all  related  to  businesses
acquired.  Goodwill  represents  the excess of the purchase  price over the fair
value of net assets of businesses acquired.  The carrying amount of goodwill was
$121.5  million as of  December  31, 2004 and $72.5  million as of December  31,
2003.  Goodwill arising from acquisitions  prior to November 1970 has never been
amortized for financial statement purposes, since, in the opinion of Management,
there has been no decrease  in the value of the  acquired  businesses.  Prior to
2002,  the values  assigned to all  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill for
acquisitions  completed  subsequent to November 1970 and prior to June 30, 2001,
were amortized on a straight-line  basis over the estimated  useful lives of the
assets, not exceeding 40 years.

     On January 1, 2002, the Company  adopted FASB  Statement No. 142,  Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. As of January 1, 2002, amortization of goodwill and
trademarks  was  terminated,  and  instead  the assets are  subject to  periodic
testing for impairment.  The Company completed its annual impairment analyses as
of September 30, 2004. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has
concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or trademarks has occurred.

     Customer   contracts  and   non-compete   agreements  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis over the period of the agreements,  as  straight-line  best
approximates  the ratio that current  revenues  bear to the total of current and
anticipated revenues,  based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance
with  Statement 142, the expected  lives of customer  contracts and  non-compete
agreements were reviewed,  and it was determined that customer  contracts should
be amortized over a life of 8 to 12 1/2 years  dependent upon customer type. The
impact  of this  review  in 2002 was an  increase  in  amortization  expense  on
customer  contracts  of  $2.0  million.  The  carrying  amount  and  accumulated
amortization for customer contracts and non-competes were as follows:




                                                              December 31,

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Customer contracts and Non-Competes                 $102,467    $ 53,550

                                                         $ 73,938    $ 30,333
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Total intangible  amortization  expense was approximately  $10.9 million in
2004,  $6.9 million in 2003 and $6.7 million in 2002.  Amortization  of customer
contracts and non-competes was approximately $10.9 million in 2004, $6.9 million
in 2003 and $6.7 million in 2002. Estimated amortization expense for each of the
five succeeding fiscal years is as follows:

5.   INCOME TAXES

     The Company's income tax provision consisted of the following:

     The Provision  for Income Taxes  resulted in an effective tax rate of 41.0%
on Income Before Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2004. For 2003 the
effective tax rate was 40.4% and for 2002 the effective tax rate was 38.0%.  The
effective  income tax rate differs from the annual  federal  statutory  tax rate
primarily because of state and foreign income taxes. During 2004, 2003 and 2002,
the Company paid income taxes of $29.0 million, $20.2 million and $10.9 million,
respectively, net of refunds.



     Deferred  income  taxes  reflect  the  net  tax  effects  of the  temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting  purposes  and  income tax  purposes.  Significant  components  of the
Company's  deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003 are
as follows:

     As of December 31, 2004, the Company has net operating  loss  carryforwards
for state  income tax  purposes of  approximately  $153  million,  which will be
available  to  offset  future  state  taxable   income.   If  not  used,   these
carryforwards will expire between 2008 and 2023. Due to the current and expected
usage of these loss  carryforwards,  management  believes that it is more likely
than not that these net operating  loss  carryforwards  will be utilized  before
their expiration.

6.   ACCRUAL FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

     The  Company  maintains  an accrual  for termite  claims  representing  the
estimated costs of  reapplications,  repairs and associated labor and chemicals,
settlements,  awards  and other  costs  relative  to termite  control  services.
Factors that may impact  future cost include  termiticide  life  expectancy  and
government  regulation.  It is significant  that the actual number of claims has
decreased in recent years due to changes in the  Company's  business  practices.
However,  it is not possible to accurately  predict future  significant  claims.
Positive  changes  to our  business  practices  include  revisions  made  to our
contracts,  more  effective  treatment  methods that  include a  directed-liquid
baiting program, more effective termiticides, and expanding training methods and
techniques.

     A  reconciliation  of changes in the accrual for termite  contracts for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows:

7.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     The Company has several  operating leases expiring at various dates through
2017.  The minimum lease  payments under  non-cancelable  operating  leases with
terms in excess of one year, in effect at December 31, 2004,  are  summarized as
follows:

                                                                $66,383
             -----------------------------------------------------------

     Total rental expense under operating leases charged to operations was $30.3
million, $28.0 million, and $27.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

     The Company  maintains  credit  facilities  with two banks that allow it to
borrow up to $70.0  million on an  unsecured  basis at the bank's  prime rate of
interest or the indexed London Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR) under which $34.5
million  in  Letters  of Credit  were  outstanding  at  December  31,  2004.  No
borrowings were outstanding  under this credit facility as of December 31, 2004,
2003 or 2002.

     Orkin, one of the Company's  subsidiaries,  is a named defendant in Butland
et al. v. Orkin Exterminating  Company, Inc. et al. pending in the Circuit Court
of Hillsborough  County,  Tampa,  Florida. The plaintiffs filed suit in March of
1999 and are seeking monetary damages and injunctive  relief. The Court ruled in
early April 2002,  certifying  the class action  lawsuit  against  Orkin.  Orkin
appealed  this  ruling to the Florida  Second  District  Court of Appeals  which
remanded the case back to the trial court for further findings.  In December the
Court issued a new ruling  certifying the class action.  Orkin intends to appeal
this new ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals.  Orkin believes
this case to be without  merit and intends to defend itself  vigorously  through
trial, if necessary. At this time, the final outcome of the litigation cannot be
determined.  However,  in the opinion of Management,  the ultimate resolution of
this action will not have a material  adverse effect on the Company's  financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

     Orkin is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the
normal course of business. In the opinion of Management, the Company's liability
under any of these matters would not materially  affect its financial  condition
or results of operations.

     Additionally,  in the normal course of business,  Orkin is a defendant in a
number of lawsuits,  which allege that  plaintiffs have been damaged as a result
of the rendering of services by Orkin personnel and equipment. Orkin is actively
contesting  these  actions.  Some lawsuits have been filed (Ernest W. Warren and
Dolores G. Warren et al. v. Orkin Exterminating  Company,  Inc., et al.; Francis
D.  Petsch,  et al. v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc.  et al.;  and Bob J.
Stevens v. Orkin  Exterminating  Company,  Inc. and Rollins,  Inc.) in which the
Plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class. The cases originate in Georgia,
Florida, and Texas. An arbitration has also been filed in Jacksonville, Florida,
by Cynthia Garrett against Orkin (Cynthia  Garrett v. Orkin,  Inc.) in which the
plaintiff  is seeking  certification  of a class.  The  Company  believes  these
matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest  certification and
defend itself  through  trial or  arbitration,  if necessary.  In the opinion of
Management, the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

8.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

       The Company maintains a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit
retirement plan (the "Plan") covering employees meeting certain age and service
requirements. The Plan provides benefits based on the average compensation for
the highest five years during the last ten years of credited service (as
defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated Social
Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plan with at least the minimum
amount required by ERISA. The Company made contributions of $3.0 million to the


Plan in 2004.  Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted  amendments to the
Plan  including  a  change  to  the  benefit   calculation   and  limiting  plan
participation to current participants. These amendments are reflected in benefit
obligations below.

     The  funded  status  of the  Plan  and the  net  amount  recognized  in the
statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of December 31:

     The accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plan was
$134,291 and $115,653 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Rollins, Inc.
uses a December 31 measurement date for its Qualified Plan.

     (Increases) decreases in the minimum pension liability which were (charged)
credited to other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  were  $(32.1)  million,  $26.1
million and $(19.9) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     The following  weighted-average  assumptions as of December 31 were used to
determine the projected benefit obligation and net benefit cost:

     The return on plan assets  reflects  the  weighted-average  of the expected
long-term  rates of return for the broad  categories of investments  held in the
plan.  The  expected  long-term  rate of  return  is  adjusted  when  there  are
fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.

     The  components  of net periodic  benefit cost for the past three years are
summarized as follows:

     At December 31, 2004 and 2003,  the Plan's assets were  comprised of listed
common  stocks and U.S.  government  and corporate  securities.  Included in the
assets of the Plan were shares of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock with a market value
of $12.0 million and $10.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     The Plan's weighted  average asset allocation at December 31, 2004 and 2003
by asset category, along with the target allocation for 2005, are as follows:



     Our  investment  strategy for our pension plan is to maximize the long-term
rate of return on plan  assets  within an  acceptable  level of risk in order to
minimize  the  cost  of  providing  pension  benefits.   The  investment  policy
establishes  a target  allocation  for each asset class,  which is rebalanced as
required.  The  plan  utilizes  a number  of  investment  approaches,  including
individual  market  securities,  equity  and  fixed  income  funds in which  the
underlying  securities  are  marketable,  and debt funds to achieve  this target
allocation.  The Company  expects to contribute  $4.0 million to $6.0 million to
the pension plan in 2005. The estimated  future  benefit  payments over the next
ten years are as follows:

     The Company sponsors a deferred  compensation 401(k) plan that is available
to substantially all employees with six months of service. The plan provides for
a matching  contribution  (made in the form of Common  Stock of the  Company) of
thirty cents ($.30) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions
to the plan  that do not  exceed 6  percent  of his or her  annual  compensation
(which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). The Company match percentage
remained  the same in 2004.  The charges to expense  for the  Company  match was
approximately  $2.7 million in 2004 and approximately  $2.3 million in both 2003
and 2002. At December 31, 2004,


2003 and 2002  approximately,  28.4%, 26.6% and 22.9%,  respectively of the plan
assets consisted of Rollins,  Inc. Common Stock. Total  administrative  fees for
the plan were approximately  $248,000 in 2004,  $265,000 in 2003 and $278,500 in
2002.

     The Company acquired the assets and related  liabilities  associated with a
Supplemental  Executive  Retirement  Plan  ("SERP") for one retired  employee of
Western Pest Services.  Under this SERP  agreement,  the individual will be paid
$101,000 per annum through 2022.

     The Company has one Employee Stock  Incentive  Plan,  adopted in April 1998
(the "1998 Plan") as a supplement  to the 1994 Plan,  which  expired in 2004. An
aggregate of 3.38 million  shares of Common Stock may be granted  under  various
stock  incentive  programs  pursuant to this plan,  at a price not less than the
market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Options may be issued
under the 1998 Plan through April 2008. The majority of options expire ten years
from the date of grant, if not exercised, and vest 20% each year over 5 years.

     Options are also  outstanding  under prior Employee Stock  Incentive  Plans
(the "1984 Plan" and the "1994 Plan"). Under these plans, 6.08 million shares of
Common Stock were subject to options  granted during the ten-year  periods ended
October 1994 and January  2004,  respectively.  The options under all plans were
granted at the fair  market  value of the shares on the date of grant and expire
ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.  No additional  options will
be granted under the 1984 Plan and 1994 Plan.

     Stock option and restricted shares transactions during the last three years
for the 1984, 1994 and 1998 plans are summarized as follows:

(1) During 2004 the Company granted 156,000  restricted shares of Company common
stock,  which  closed at $17.33 per share on the date of the  grant,  and 72,000
restricted  shares of Company common stock,  which closed at $15.95 per share on
the date of the grant, to employees. The shares vest over six years, 20% a year,
with the first installment vesting on the second anniversary of the grant date.

Restricted Stock -- Rollins has granted employees two forms of restricted stock;
performance  restricted and time lapse  restricted.  The performance  restricted
shares are  granted,  but not  earned  and  issued,  until  certain  performance
criteria are met. The performance  criteria are  predetermined  market prices of
Rollins'  common  stock.   Time  lapse  restricted  shares  vest  after  certain
stipulated  number of years from the grant date,  depending  on the terms of the
issue.  The Company has issued time lapse  restricted  shares that vest over ten
years in prior years and in 2004 issued time lapse  restricted  shares that vest
in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over
six years from the date of grant.  During  these  years,  grantees  receive  all
dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. Compensation
cost on  restricted  shares is recorded at the fair market  value on the date of
issuance  and  amortized  ratably  over  the  respective  vesting  periods.  The
agreements  under  which the  restricted  stock is issued  provide  that  shares
awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions  established
under the plans have  lapsed.  During  the year ended  December  31,  2004,  the
Company recognized $440,752 in compensation costs related to restricted stock.

10.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
     On April 28,  2004,  the  Company  sold real estate in  Okeechobee  County,
Florida to LOR, Inc., a company  controlled by R. Randall  Rollins,  Chairman of
the  Board of  Rollins,  Inc.  and Gary W.  Rollins,  Chief  Executive  Officer,
President  and Chief  Operating  Officer of Rollins,  Inc. for $16.6  million in
cash.  The sale  resulted  in a net gain after tax of $8.1  million or $0.11 per
share since the real estate had appreciated  over  approximately 30 years it had
been owned by the  Company.  The Company  deferred a portion of the gain pending
the  completion  of a survey  that may  result in the return of a portion of the
proceeds.  The real estate was under a lease  agreement  with annual  rentals of
$131,939  that would have expired June 30,  2007.  On May 28, 2004,  the Company
sold real estate in Sussex  County,  Delaware to LOR, Inc. for $111,000 in cash.
The sale resulted in an  immaterial  net gain after tax. The Board of Directors,
at its  quarterly  meeting on January 27,  2004,  approved  the  formation  of a
committee  (the  "Committee")  made up of Messrs.  Bill J.  Dismuke and James B.
Williams,  who are  independent  directors,  to evaluate  the  transactions.  In
addition,  the Company on October 22, 2004 purchased real estate located at 2158
Piedmont  Road,  N.E.,  Atlanta,   Georgia  30324,  adjacent  to  the  Company's
headquarters,  from LOR, Inc. for $4.6 million. The Committee was furnished with
full  disclosure of the  transactions,  including  independent  appraisals,  and
determined  that the terms of the  transactions  were reasonable and fair to the
Company.  The Company sold an additional  piece of real estate in Sussex County,
Delaware to LOR,  Inc. or an entity  wholly owned by LOR,  Inc. The  transaction
took place on December  29, 2004 and resulted in a $6.3  million,  net of costs,
gain after taxes.



11.  UNAUDITED QUARTERLY DATA

     All earnings per share data for the quarters prior to the second quarter of
2003 have been restated for the three-for-two  stock split on March 10, 2003 and
all  earnings  per  share  data for the  quarters  have  been  restated  for the
three-for-two stock split effective March 10, 2005.



12.  STOCK SPLIT

     The Board of  Directors,  at its  quarterly  meeting on January  25,  2005,
authorized a three-for-two  stock split by the issuance on March 10, 2005 of one
additional  common  share for each two common  shares held of record on February
10,  2005.  Accordingly,  the par value for  additional  shares  issued  will be
adjusted to common stock,  and fractional  shares resulting from the stock split
will be settled in cash. All share and per share data appearing  throughout this
Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted for this split.

     Also, at the same meeting, the Board of Directors authorized a 25% increase
in the Company's quarterly dividend. The increased regular quarterly dividend of
$0.05 per share, as adjusted for the stock split, will be payable March 10, 2005
to  stockholders  of record at the close of  business  February  10,  2005.  The
Company's new annual  dividend rate is $0.20 per share as adjusted for the stock
split.




13.  ACQUISITIONS

     On April 30, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Western Pest Services ("Western").  The Company's
consolidated  financial statements include the operating results of Western from
the date of the  acquisition.  Neither  Western nor its principals had any prior
relationship  with the  Company or its  affiliates.  Western  was engaged in the
business of providing pest control and termite  services and the Company intends
to  continue  this  business.  The  acquisition  was made  pursuant  to an Asset
Purchase  Agreement  (the  "Western  Agreement")  dated  March 8, 2004,  between
Rollins, Inc. and Western Industries, Inc. and affiliates. The consideration for
the assets and certain  noncompetition  agreements  (the  "Purchase  Price") was
approximately  $110.2 million,  including  approximately $8.4 million of assumed
liabilities.  The  Purchase  Price was  funded  with  cash on hand,  the sale of
property  located in  Okeechobee  County,  Florida  and a $15.0  million  senior
unsecured revolving credit facility.


     Pursuant to the Western Agreement,  the Company acquired  substantially all
of Western's property and assets,  including accounts receivable,  real property
leases,  seller  contracts,  governmental  authorizations,   data  and  records,
intangible  rights and  property  and  insurance  benefits.  As described in the
Western Agreement, the Company assumed only specified liabilities of Western and
obligations under disclosed assigned contracts.


     The  Company  engaged  an  independent  valuation  firm  to  determine  the
allocation  of the  Western  purchase  price.  Such  valuation  resulted  in the
allocation of $39.6  million to Goodwill and $51.0  million to other  intangible
assets,  principally  customer  contracts.  The finite-lived  intangible assets,
principally  customer  contracts,  are being amortized over periods  principally
ranging  from 8 to 12.5 years on a  straight-lined  basis.  The total  amount of
goodwill  recorded  as a  result  of  the  acquisition  is  expected  to be  tax
deductible over the appropriate periods.


     On April 30, 2004, in a transaction  ancillary to the Western  acquisition,
the Company acquired Residex Corporation ("Residex"), a company that distributes
chemicals and other products to pest  management  professionals,  pursuant to an
Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Residex  Agreement") dated March 8, 2004, between
Rollins,  Inc.  and  Western  Industries,  Inc.,  JBD  Incorporated  and Residex
Corporation.  Subsequently  on April 30,  2004,  the Company  sold Residex to an
industry  distribution group. The amounts involved were not material and no gain
or loss was recognized on the transaction.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

     Evaluation  of  Disclosure  Controls and  Procedures--We  have  established
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure,  among other things, that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
made known to the officers who certify the  Company's  financial  reports and to
other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.

     Based on  management's  evaluation  as of December 31,  2004,  in which the
principal  executive  officer  and  principal  financial  officer of the Company
participated,  the principal  executive officer and principal  financial officer
have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934) are
effective,  at the  reasonable  assurance  level to ensure that the  information
required to be  disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.

     Management's     Report    on    Internal     Control    Over     Financial
Reporting--Management's  Report on Internal Control Over Financial  Reporting is
contained on page 65.



     Changes in  Internal  Controls--  There  were no  changes  in our  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  during  the  fourth  quarter  of 2004  that
materially  affected  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect  these
controls.  As of  December  31,  2004,  we  did  not  identify  any  significant
deficiency  or material  weaknesses in our internal  controls,  and therefore no
corrective actions were taken.

     Western  Pest  Services--We   have  identified   several  internal  control
deficiencies at Western Pest Control,  which was acquired on April 30, 2004, and
the Company has initiated a project to identify  internal  control  deficiencies
and implement changes.  Most of these identified  deficiencies  center around IT
controls  and  organizational  issues that  affect  smaller  companies,  such as
separation of duties,  management  reviews,  and  documentation  of policies and
procedures.

position  of  Rollins,  Inc. (a Delaware  Corporation)  and  subsidiaries  as of
December  31,  2004,  and  the  related   consolidated   statements  of  income,
stockholders'  equity and cash flows for the year then  ended.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audit.

     We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial  statements.  An audit also  includes  assessing  the  accounting
principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Rollins,  Inc. and  subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2004, and the  consolidated
results  of their  operations  and their  cash  flows for the year then ended in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

     Our audit was  conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The Schedule II for the year
ended  December  31, 2004,  listed in the Index at Item 15(a) is  presented  for
purposes  of  additional  analysis  and  is not a  required  part  of the  basic
financial  statements.   This  schedule  has  been  subjected  to  the  auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated  financial  statements
and, in our opinion,  is fairly  stated in all material  respects in relation to
the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

     As described in Note 1, the Company  changed its method of  accounting  for
the revenues and costs associated with conventional termite renewal contracts in
2004.

     We also have  audited,  in  accordance  with the  standards  of the  Public
Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  effectiveness  of
Rollins,  Inc.'s  internal  control over financial  reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria  established in Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway  Commission
(COSO) and our report dated February 25, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion.

        MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

     The  management  of  Rollins,  Inc. is  responsible  for  establishing  and
maintaining  adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.
Rollins maintains a system of internal  accounting  controls designed to provide
reasonable assurance,  at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded against
loss or unauthorized use and that the financial  records are adequate and can be
relied  upon to produce  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  accounting
principles  generally  accepted in the United  States of America.  The  internal
control  system is augmented by written  policies  and  procedures,  an internal
audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel. This system
includes  policies  that require  adherence to ethical  business  standards  and
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

     Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of our  Management,
including our principal  executive officer and principal  financial officer,  we
conducted an evaluation  of the  effectiveness  of the design and  operations of
internal  controls over  financial  reporting,  as of December 31, 2004 based on
criteria  established in Internal  Control--Integrated  framework  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this
evaluation,  management's  assessment is that Rollins, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.

     In  conducting  Rollins,  Inc.'s  evaluation  of the  effectiveness  of its
internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  Rollins,  Inc.  has excluded its
wholly-owned  subsidiary  Western Pest Services which was acquired in 2004. This
acquisition constituted 26% of total assets as of December 31, 2004, and 6.5% of
revenues for the year then ended. Refer to Note 13 in the consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of this acquisition and its impact on Rollins,
Inc.'s financial statements.

     The independent  registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton, who has
audited the  consolidated  financial  statements for the year ended December 31,
2004,  included in the 2004 annual  report,  have also  issued  their  report on
management's  assessment  of  the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial
reporting.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control
                            over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.

     We have audited management's  assessment included in Management's Report on
Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting included in Rollins,  Inc.'s Form 10K
for 2004,  that  Rollins,  Inc. (a Delaware  Corporation)  maintained  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as of December  31, 2004 based on
criteria  established in Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework  issued by the
Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (COSO).
Rollins,  Inc.'s  management is responsible for maintaining  effective  internal
control over financial  reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial  reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's  assessment and an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

     We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and  perform  the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether
effective  internal  control over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all
material  respects.  Our audit included  obtaining an  understanding of internal
control over financial reporting,  evaluating management's  assessment,  testing
and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control,  and
performing   such  other   procedures   as  we   considered   necessary  in  the
circumstances.  We believe that our audit  provides a  reasonable  basis for our
opinions.

     A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the company;  (2)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the Company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

     Because  of its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial
reporting  may not prevent or detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of any
evaluation  of  effectiveness  to future  periods  are  subject to the risk that
controls may become  inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     As indicated in  Management's  Report on Internal  Controls Over  Financial
Reporting,  management's  assessment of and conclusion on the  effectiveness  of
internal control over financial  reporting did not include the internal controls
of its wholly-owned  subsidiary Western Pest Services which was acquired in 2004
and constituted 26% of total assets as of December 31, 2004 and 6.5% of revenues
for  the  year  then  ended.  Refer  to Note  13 to the  consolidated  financial
statements for further discussion of this acquisition and its impact on Rollins,
Inc.'s  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our audit of internal control over
financial  reporting of Rollins,  Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the
internal control over financial reporting of Western Pest Services.

     In our opinion,  management's  assessment  that  Rollins,  Inc.  maintained
effective internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004, is
fairly  stated,  in all  material  respects,  based on criteria  established  in
Internal Control--Integrated  Framework issued by the COSO. Also in our opinion,
Rollins, Inc. maintained,  in all material respects,  effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria  established
in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

     We have also  audited,  in  accordance  with the  standards  of the  Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),  the consolidated  statement
of financial position of Rollins,  Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004
and the related  consolidated  statements of income,  stockholders'  equity, and
cash



flows for the year ended  December  31, 2004 and our report  dated  February 25,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

related consolidated  statements of income,  stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also
included  the  financial  statement  schedule  for each of the two  years in the

     We  conducted  our audits in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public

statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects,  the consolidated  financial position of Rollins, Inc.
and  Subsidiaries  at December 31, 2003, and the  consolidated  results of their
operations  and their cash  flows for each of the two years in the period  ended

principles.  Also, in our opinion,  the related financial statement schedule for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2003,  when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,  presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.
