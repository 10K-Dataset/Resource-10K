Item
1.           	Business

General

Rollins,
Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting,
Inc.

The Company
is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America, Australia, and Europe with
international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, Canada,
Australia, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin,
LLC. (“Orkin”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite
control company. It provides customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin either serves customers, directly or through franchise
operations, in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa,
and Mexico providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses,
including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under
the Orkin

®

, and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand
name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin Canada,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada’s largest pest control
provider and a leader in the development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western
Pest Services (“Western”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service company and its business complements most of the services Orkin
offers focusing on the northeastern United States.

The Industrial
Fumigant Company (“IFC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam Pest
Defense (“HomeTeam”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx

®

tubes in the wall pest control
system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services
home builders nationally.

Rollins Australia
(“Rollins Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”), in February
2014. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional commercial, residential,
and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity program and provides
specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.

Rollins Wildlife
Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Critter Control on February 27, 2015. Critter Control was established
by 1983 and has operations in 40 states and 2 Canadian provinces.

Rollins UK was
formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to acquire Safeguard Pest Control (“Safeguard”). Safeguard, which
was acquired in June 2016, is a pest control company established in the United Kingdom in 1991 with a history of providing superior
pest control, bird control, and specialist services to residential and commercial customers.

The Company
has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The Company
has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for
this segment, which includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the
Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico are included in Item 8 of this document, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” on pages 25 and 26. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any
single customer or a few customers or the Company’s foreign operations.

Common
Stock Repurchase Program

All share
and per share data presented have been adjusted to account for the three-for-two stock split effective March 10, 2015. At the
July 24, 2012 Board of Directors’ meeting, the Board authorized the purchase of 7.5 million shares of the Company’s
common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company repurchased on the open market 0.8 million shares
and 19 thousand shares at a weighted average price of $27.19 and $22.42, respectively. In total, there are 5.1 million additional
shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

Franchising
Programs

Orkin
Franchises

The Company
continues to expand its growth through Orkin’s franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where
it is currently not economically feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are subject to a contractual
buyback provision at Orkin’s option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise.
International franchise agreements also contain an optional buyback provision; however, the franchisee has the prior right of
renewal of agreement. The Company through its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994,
and established its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean,
the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico.

of Critter Control’s locations are franchised. Critter Control had 94 franchises and 108 franchises in the United States
and Canada as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The Company purchased Critter Control in 2015.

Seasonality

The business
of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest
presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined
by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the Company’s pest and
termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The Company
has relationships with a national pest control product distributor and other vendors for pest and termite control treatment products.
The Company maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing needs and
to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers.

Competition

The Company
believes that Rollins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, Orkin Canada, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest Services,
The Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, Trutech, Permatreat, Rollins Australia, Critter Control
and Safeguard Pest Control compete favorably with competitors as the world’s largest pest and termite control company. The
Company’s competitors include Terminix, Ecolab and Rentokil.

The principal
methods of competition in the Company’s pest and termite control markets are quality of service, customer proximity and
guarantee terms, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, and price.

Research
and Development

Expenditures
by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the
new and improved service methods and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies.
Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.


The Company
maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.

The Company
conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products.  The Company also works closely with leading
scientists, educators, industry consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.

Environmental
and Regulatory Considerations

The Company’s
pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment,
public health and consumers. Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Federal
Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act (“FIFRA”)

This
federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which
pest control companies operate. Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the
following: licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This allows
each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens’
wishes in each state. The pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food
Quality Protection Act of 1996 (“FQPA”)

The FQPA
governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts
its business.

Environmental
Remediation

The Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, is the primary Federal
statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties.
Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous substances,
and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will work with the
EPA and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Consistent with
the Company’s responsibilities under these regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments and remediation
of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these situations
arise, the Company accrues management’s best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management’s
current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the Company’s financial condition
or operating results.

Employees

The number
of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2017 was approximately 12,000.

Item
1.A.

Risk Factors

We
may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.

We operate
in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices, and general
economic issues. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a
finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality,
and product availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe that
our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to
maintain our competitive position.

Economic
conditions may adversely affect our business

Pest
and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers. As consumers restrict their discretionary
expenditures, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect
our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly
sensitive to adverse economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or
cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.


Our business
depends on our strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base
of customers.

Our strong brands, Rollins, Orkin, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company,
Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, Trutech, Perma Treat, Critter Control, Allpest, and Safeguard Pest Control have significantly
contributed to the success of our business.  Maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets
and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers.  Our brands may be negatively impacted
by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues and product/technical failures.  Further, if our brands
are significantly damaged, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 
Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide high-quality,
pest control products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people’s lives.

We
may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions
have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure investors that we will be able
to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure investors that
we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Any inability
on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

Our
operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

Our operations
are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide. The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the
Company’s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of
termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically
resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods.
The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for
extended periods.

Our
inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our ability
to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our ability
to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees is high,
and the supply is very limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in
our skilled labor force, increases in wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and profitability
could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

Our
operations could be affected if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, employees and third
parties, we could be subject to interruption of our business operations, private litigation, reputational damage and costly penalties.

We rely on,
among other things, commercially available vendors, cyber protection systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security
for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information of customers, employees and third parties, such as payment
card and personal information. The systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the
technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, meeting standards set by the
payment card industry (“PCI”). We continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for PCI compliance purposes,
and such PCI standards may change from time to time. Activities by third parties, advances in computer and software capabilities
and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise
or breach of our systems. Any compromises, breaches or errors in applications related to our systems or failures to comply with
standards set by the PCI could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations, including our customers’
ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products and could
result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations, orders, industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs, penalties
and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations
and cash flows. Also, a breach of credit card data security could expose us to customer litigation.

Our operations could be affected
by pending and ongoing litigation.

In the
normal course of business, some of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which
allege that plaintiffs have been damaged.  The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation,
either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position; however, it is
possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material
to the results of an individual year

.

Our
operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our business
is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in
such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations,
how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, or whether additional laws and regulations
will be adopted. We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and
regulations. We also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. However,
such environmental laws are changed frequently. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in the future, materially
affect our operations and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses,
fines, and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.


The
Company’s management has a substantial ownership interest; public stockholders may have no effective voice in the Company’s
management.

The Company
has elected the “Controlled Company” exemption under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
Listed Company Manual. The Company is a “Controlled Company” because a group that includes the Company’s Chairman
of the Board, R. Randall Rollins and his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and a
director of the Company and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company’s
voting power. As a “Controlled Company,” the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules.

Rollins,
Inc.’s executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the
aggregate, approximately 57 percent of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will
effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions
such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the
effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Our
management has a substantial ownership interest, and the availability of the Company’s common stock to the investing public
may be limited.

The availability
of Rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive officers, directors
and their affiliates, which could negatively impact Rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders
to sell their shares. Future sales by executive officers, directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could
also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.

Provisions
in Rollins, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the Company.

Rollins,
Inc.’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements
for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the Board of Directors. These provisions may make a tender offer, change in
control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company’s Board of Directors more difficult or expensive.

Item
1.B.       	Unresolved Staff Comments

None


Item
2.           	Properties.

The Company’s
administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The
Company owns or leases over 500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins Training Center
located in Atlanta, Georgia, the Rollins Customer Service Center located in Covington, Georgia, and the Pacific Division Administration
and Training Center in Riverside, California. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important
physical property of the Company. The facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future
needs of the Company.

Item
3.           	Legal Proceedings.

In the
normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases
and claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business.
We are actively contesting each of these matters.

On December
2, 2014, Plaintiff Killian Pest Control sued Rollins, Inc. and its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense alleging that HomeTeam’s
exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, and California’s
Cartwright Act and Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates
the Sherman and Cartwright Acts, and the Business and Professions Code; a permanent injunction against continuing alleged violations;
and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. Because discovery
remains open and there are unresolved questions of fact and law, the Company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, and intends
to defend this matter vigorously.

On December
2, 2014, Plaintiff Jose Luis Garnica, on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated customers, sued Rollins, Inc. and
its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense alleging that HomeTeam’s exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system
violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act. A second Plaintiff, Cora Potter, subsequently was added. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory
judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the Sherman Act; a permanent injunction against continuing violations; and monetary
damages. On February 3, 2017, the Court issued an order denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. At a hearing
on February 9, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffs leave to seek certification of a class of customers limited to their own geographic
market, the Bakersfield, California area. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California.
Because discovery remains open and there are unresolved questions of fact and law, the Company cannot currently estimate the loss,
if any, and intends to defend this matter vigorously.

Management
does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual quarter or year.

As of
January 31, 2017, there were 2,200 holders of record of the Company’s common stock.

shares by the issuance on March 10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at February
10, 2015. The stock split increased the Company’s outstanding shares from 145,783,052 to 218,674,578 shares.

On January
24, 2017 the Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend per common share of $0.115 payable March 10, 2017 to stockholders
of record at the close of business February 10, 2017. On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors declared its regular $0.10 per
share as well as a special year-end dividend of $0.10 per share both payable December 9, 2016 to stockholders of record at the
close of business November 10, 2016. The Company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to the common stockholders, subject
to the earnings and financial condition of the Company and other relevant factors.

discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document.
The following discussion (as well as other discussions in this document) contains forward-looking statements. Please see “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with

The
Company

Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state
of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc. The Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta,
Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers
in North America, Australia, and Europe with international franchises in Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle
East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that specifies the treatment
specifics and the pricing arrangement with the customer.

The Company
has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. The Company’s results of operations and its financial
condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company’s foreign operations.

General Operating Comments

marked the Company’s 19th consecutive year of improved revenues and profits. Revenues for the year rose 5.9 percent to $1.573
billion compared to $1.485 billion for the prior year. Income before income taxes increased 7.2% to $260.6 million compared to
$243.2 million the prior year. Net income increased 10.0% to $167.4 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.77 compared
to $152.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted share for the prior year.

All of
our business lines experienced growth for the year, with residential pest control revenues up 7.3%, commercial pest control revenues
up 4.4% and termite revenues up 6.3%.

The Company
experienced growth in our Specialty Brands, Emerging Opportunity and Wildlife Brands all of which reported impressive growth numbers
for the year. These results underscore the value that the Company is experiencing in selectively acquiring, market-leading specialty
pest control, and wildlife companies.

Rollins
continued to make inroads in expanding brand recognition through growing the Company’s international presence in 2016 both
through expansion in Australia and entry into the United Kingdom. The Company also announced it established 23 new Orkin international
franchises during the year. Twelve of these franchises are located in China, while the others are located in Brazil, Mongolia,
Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Malaysia and the Kingdom of Cambodia. All of these franchises will offer commercial
and residential pest control as well as termite services where applicable. With the addition of these new franchises we have now
established Orkin’s presence in 45 countries through 70 international franchises.


The Company
is pleased with the successful Orkin rollout of the customer relationship management (CRM) system (BOSS), and is benefiting from
the investments made updating this system to improve the customer experience.

Strategic
acquisitions remain a priority for Rollins, and as in the past, we will continue to seek out companies that are a “fit”
for us in both, the pest control and wildlife areas of our business.

Results
of Operations—2016 Versus 2015

Overview

The Company’s revenues increased to $1.573 billion in 2016, a 5.9% increase compared to 2015. Gross
margin increased to 50.9% for 2016 from 50.4% in 2015. Sales, general and administrative expense remained flat at 31.2% of revenues
in 2016 compared to 2015. The Company’s depreciation and amortization margin increased 0.2 percentage points to 3.2% in 2016
compared to 3.0% in 2015. Rollins’ net income of $167.4 million in 2016 was an increase of $15.2 million or 10.0% over $152.1
million in 2015. Net profit margin improved to 10.6% in 2016 from 10.2% in 2015. Rollins continued to expand our global brand recognition
with acquisitions in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom as well as expanding our Orkin international franchise
program in numerous countries around the globe. The Company is now in 47 countries and continues to seek new opportunities.

Revenues

Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.573 billion, an increase of $88.2 million or 5.9% from 2015 revenues of $1.485 billion.
Growth occurred across all service lines and brands with our Canadian and Australian companies being hindered by unfavorable foreign
currency exchange rates. Organic growth and pricing accounted for approximately 5.2% of our increase and our acquisitions contributed
the remaining revenue growth. Commercial pest control represented approximately 40% of the Company’s revenue in 2016 and
grew 4.4% due to increases in sales, increased bed bug revenue, an increase in commercial fumigations, and acquisitions. Commercial
pest control was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange as Orkin Canada and Rollins Australia are heavily commercial.
Residential pest control which represented approximately 42% of the Company’s revenue, increased 7.3% driven by increased
leads, the improved closure and pricing as well as increased TAEXX® homebuilder installations, bed bug revenues and acquisitions.
The Company’s termite business, which represented approximately 17% of the Company’s revenue, grew 6.3% in 2016 due
to acquisitions, increases in drywood fumigations and ancillary service sales, (such as moisture control and insulation).

The Company
implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2016. Less than 2% of the Company’s revenue increase came from
pricing actions. Approximately 80% of the Company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2016 as well as 2015.

The Company’s
foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Foreign currency exchange translation and increased domestic revenues have reduced the percentage in both years. The Company established
new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2016 for a total of 70 Orkin international franchises, two
Canadian Critter Control franchises, and four Australian franchises operated by Murray Pest Control at December 31, 2016, compared
to 48 Orkin international franchises and two Canadian Critter Control franchises at December 31, 2015.

International and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the Company’s revenues for 2016.
Orkin had 120 and 99 franchises (domestic and international) at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company had 94 Critter
Control franchises and 4 Murray Pest Control franchises at December 31, 2016, down 14 from 2015. Critter Control Operations, Inc.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has begun the process of purchasing Critter Control franchises. Revenue from franchises
was up 8.4% in 2016 compared to 2015.

Cost
of Services Provided

For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2016 cost of services provided increased $36.4 million or 4.9%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2015. Gross margin for the year increased to 50.9% for 2016 compared to 50.4% for 2015 due to favorable service
salary cost as we finalized the roll-out of BOSS, our CRM and operating system, improving our routing and scheduling to maximize
efficiencies, lower personnel related expenses as healthcare claims were lower than expected, and insurance and claims were lower
as a percentage of revenues as we continue to focus on efficiency and safety. The favorable margins were partially offset by professional
fees as we used outside sources to roll-out BOSS. We experienced good cost controls across most spending categories during 2016
compared to 2015.

Depreciation
and Amortization

For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization increased $6.4 million, or 14.3% compared to the twelve months ended
December 31, 2015. The dollar increase was due primarily to depreciation increasing $5.4 million as we began to depreciate our
CRM software BOSS, while amortization of intangible assets increased as we acquired 34 companies in 2016.

Sales,
General and Administrative

For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2016, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $26.8 million, or 5.8%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. SG&A remained flat at 31.2% of revenues for each of the years 2016
and 2015. The Company had a one-time tax event to dissolve its subsidiary, Kinro Investment Inc. This increased SG&A expense
$9.1 million or 0.6 percentage points due to the one-time tax event that was offset as a credit in income tax expense. Sales salaries
increased due to the increase in sales commissions and service contracts increased as a result of maintaining the BOSS system.
The increases were offset by decreases as a percentage of revenue by administrative salaries as we continue to grow revenue with
a static headcount, personnel related expense margin decreased due to lower than expected healthcare claims, and decreases in
insurance claims as we continue to focus on efficiency and safety, and telephone costs we negotiate contracts for Internet service.


Gain on Sales
of assets, Net

Gain
on sales of assets, net decreased to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.0 million gain in 2015.
The Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and owned property in 2016 and 2015. The decrease was due to the
Company selling two buildings in 2015.

Interest
(Income)/Expense, Net

Interest
income, net for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.2 million. Interest income for each year is due to interest
received on cash balances in the Company’s various cash accounts.

Taxes

The Company’s
effective tax rate decreased to 35.8% in 2016 compared to 37.4% in 2015, due primarily to a one-time tax event in 2016 and differences
in state and foreign income taxes.

Results
of Operations—2015 Versus 2014

Overview

The Company’s
gross margin increased to 50.4% for 2015 from 49.9% in 2014. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased in 2015 to 31.2%
of revenue versus 31.3% in 2014. The Company’s depreciation and amortization margin decreased 0.1 point to 3.0 % in 2015
compared to 3.1% in 2014. Rollins’ net income of $152.1 million in 2015 was an increase of $14.5 million or 10.5% over $137.7
million in 2014. Net profit margin improved to 10.2% in 2015 from 9.8% in 2014.

Revenues

Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.485 billion, an increase of $73.7 million or 5.2% from 2014 revenues of $1.412 billion.
Growth occurred across all service lines and brands with our foreign companies being hurt by unfavorable exchange rates. Organic
growth and pricing accounted for approximately 4.2% of our increase and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth.
Commercial pest control represented approximately 41% of the Company’s revenue in 2015 and grew 3.3% in 2015 due to increases
in sales, improvements in cancellations, increased bed bug revenue, an increase in commercial fumigations, and acquisitions. Residential
pest control which also represented approximately 41% of the Company’s revenue, increased 6.6% driven by increased leads,
closures and pricing as well as increased TAEXX® homebuilder installations, bed bug revenues and acquisitions. The Company’s
termite business, which represented approximately 17% of the Company’s revenue, grew 4.6% in 2015 due to increases in drywood
fumigations and ancillary service sales, and acquisitions.

The Company
implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2015. Less than 2% of the Company’s revenue increase came from
pricing actions. Nearly 80% of the Company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2015 and 2014.

The Company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% and 8% of total revenues for the years
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Currency exchange translation is the cause of the decreased percentage. The Company
established new franchises in China, El Salvador, Mexico, Colombia, the Republic of Georgia, Bahrain, Qatar, Hong Kong, Macau,
and South Korea in 2015 for a total of 48 international franchises at December 31, 2015 with 37 at December 31, 2014. Orkin had
99 and 92 franchises (domestic and international) at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Cost
of Services Provided

For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2015 cost of services provided increased $28.2 million or 4.0%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2014. Gross margin for the year increased to 50.4% for 2015 compared to 49.9% for 2014 due to reduced fleet
costs due to the drop in gasoline prices, favorable service salaries as we continue to improve our routing and scheduling to maximize
efficiencies and favorable administrative salary margins as we continue to focus on efficiency. The favorable margins were partially
offset by our casualty claim development, increases in supplies as a result of increased sales and increases in personnel related
costs as group premiums continue to increase. We experienced good cost controls across most spending categories.

Depreciation
and Amortization

For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2015, depreciation and amortization increased $1.0 million, or 2.3% compared to the twelve months ended
December 31, 2014. The dollar increase was due primarily to depreciation increasing $2.7 million as we depreciate our customer
relationship management software “BOSS”, while amortization of intangible assets decreased as we fully amortized several
intangible assets during the 12 month period.

Sales, General
and Administrative

For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2015, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $22.0 million, or 5.0%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. SG&A decreased to 31.2% of revenues compared to 31.3% of revenues in
the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased due to the Company’s leveraging our SG&A expenses against
higher revenues, reducing our bad debt expense with our collections efforts and experiencing lower gasoline costs, partially offset
by higher sales salaries.

Gain
on Sales of assets, Net

Gain
on sales of assets, net increased to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $0.6 million gain in 2014.
The Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and property in 2015 and 2014. The increase was due to the Company
selling two buildings in 2015.


Interest
(Income)/Expense, Net

Interest
income, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to $0.3 million in 2014.
Interest income for the year is due to interest received on cash balances in the Company’s various cash accounts.

Taxes

The Company’s
effective tax rate increased to 37.4% in 2015 compared to 37.3% in 2014, due primarily to differences in state and foreign income
taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash
and Cash Flow

Cash
from operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses.

The most
significant source of cash in Rollins’ cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is
collecting cash resulting from services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees,
tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.

The
Company’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $142.8 million, $134.6 million, and $108.4
million, respectively.

Cash Provided
by Operating Activities

The Company’s
operations generated cash of $226.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily from net income of $167.4 million,
compared with cash provided by operating activities of $196.4 million in 2015 and $194.1 million in 2014. The Company believes
its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities and available
borrowings under its $175.0 million credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and
fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future.

The Company
made contributions totaling $3.3 million to the Rollins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ defined benefit retirement
plans (the “Plans”) during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $5.0 million and $5.3 million during the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of the Plans’ funding status. The Company is considering making contributions
to its Plans of approximately $5.5 million during fiscal year 2017. In the opinion of management, additional Plan contributions
will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Cash
Used in Investing Activities

The
Company used $76.8 million on investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $69.9 million and $89.5 million
during 2015 and 2014, respectively, and of that, invested approximately $33.1 million in capital expenditures during 2016 compared
to $39.5 million and $28.7 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of
property purchases, equipment replacements and technology related projects. The Company expects to invest between $25.0 million
and $28.0 million in 2017 in capital expenditures. During 2016, the Company’s subsidiaries acquired several small companies
totaling $46.3 million compared to $33.5 million in acquisitions during 2015 and $63.3 million in 2014. The expenditures for the
Company’s acquisitions were funded with cash on hand. The Company continues to seek new acquisitions.

Cash
Used in Financing Activities

The Company
used cash of $136.4 million on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $97.2 million and $106.5
million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. A total of $109.0 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.50 per share) during the
year ended December 31, 2016 including a special dividend paid in December 2016 of $0.10 per share, compared to $91.8 million
paid in cash dividends ($0.42 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2015, including a special dividend paid in December
2015 of $0.10 per share and $75.8 million ($0.35 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2014, including a special dividend
paid in December 2014 of $0.07 per share.

The Company
used $22.7 million to repurchase on the open market 0.8 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $27.19
per share during 2016 compared to $0.4 million to purchase 19 thousand shares at an weighted average price of $22.42 in 2015 and
$29.3 million to purchase 1.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $19.46 in 2014. There remain 5.1 million shares authorized
to be repurchased under prior Board approval. In addition to the shares purchased on the open market, the Company repurchased
$8.4 million, $7.0 million and $6.2 million of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively,
from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.

The Company’s
$142.8 million of total cash at December 31, 2016, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $54.4
million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $88.4 million is primarily held in Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times
may exceed federally insured amounts.


The Company’s
international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment
of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The Company
maintains a large cash position in the United States while having no third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate liquidity
and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations
and to fund expansion of its domestic business.

On October
31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured
line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline
subfacility. The Credit Agreement was amended on October 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2018 and add three
optional one year extensions. On October 27, 2015 the Company exercised a one year extension option to extend the maturity date
to October 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility.
The Company maintains approximately $35.0 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company’s
fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured status, to secure various workers’
compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources
and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

The Revolving
Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is
October 31, 2019, subject to up to two optional extensions of the Credit Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the
Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company’s election:

·

the
                                         Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative
                                         Agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal
                                         Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals
                                         LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the
                                         U.S. Federal Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month,

plus

1.0% per annum.

·

with
                                         respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus an additional amount,
                                         which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon Rollins’ then-current debt-to-EBITDA
                                         ratio. As of December 31, 2015, the additional rate allocated was .75%.

The Revolving
Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including
covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell
substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants restricting
the Company’s ability to permit the ratio of the Company’s consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The Company
remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2016 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2017.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company
views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
results of operations, and that require management’s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances
that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual
for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors
that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number
of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible
to precisely predict future significant claims. Accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term
accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Accrued
Insurance—

The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’
compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued
based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may
not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts
an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical
claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge
of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective
and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always
an accurate indication of future events. The Company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing
programs to reduce claims. Initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle
report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing,
increased driver training and a post-injury nurse triage program for employees.

Revenue
Recognition—

The Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services
are performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing
services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring
in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments
within a given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the
time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full
year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered.
The Company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite
baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting
services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the
monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the
contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis
over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing
monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There
are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal
revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing
the required monitoring visits.

Revenue received
for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the
cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding
claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information.
The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an
insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the
future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue
are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared
to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

All revenues
are reported net of sales taxes.

Contingency
Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the
litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately
predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation
are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management,
the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.


Defined
benefit pension plans

— In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. defined
benefit plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005. The Company also
includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan to the Company’s financial statements. The Company accounts
for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715

“Compensation- Retirement Benefits”

,
and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates
the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate,
and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.

The Company
chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the
investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets
and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects
future pension expense. The Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from
the prior year.

The discount
rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating
this rate, the Company utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company’s expected
benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at
the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to
apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the
corporate bonds. The discount rate was 4.45% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 4.7% in 2015 and 4.15% in 2014. A lower discount
rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.

As set forth
in note 14 to the Company’s financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan’s investments are
real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These investments
are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable
fair value. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-12 “

Investments In Certain Entities
That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),”

these investments are valued based on the net asset value
per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of
the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to
mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the
financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness

.

As of December
31, 2016, the defined benefit plans were under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased
stockholders’ equity by $3.0 million before tax and $1.7 million after tax.

New Accounting
Standards

Recently
adopted accounting standards

In May
2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for
Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (“ASU 2015-07”). Under
the guidance, investments measured at NAV, as a practical expedient for fair value, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.
Removing investments measured using the practical expedient from the fair value hierarchy is intended to eliminate the diversity
in practice that currently exists with respect to the categorization of these investments. The new guidance is effective in 2017,
however early adoption is permitted. We have elected to early adopt ASU 2015-07 retrospectively for the investments eligible for
the NAV practical expedient.

In November
2015, the FASB issued ASU No. (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update
apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities
and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments
in this update. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application
is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this update may
be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We have
elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 retrospectively in the first quarter of 2016. As a result, we have presented all deferred tax
assets and liabilities as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheets, and have reclassified current deferred tax assets and
liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. There was no net impact on our results of operations as
a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-17.


Recently
issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2017 or later

In May 2014,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount
of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace
most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral
of this standard, with a revised effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted,
although not prior to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits either of the following transition
methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the
option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting
ASU 2014 – 09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). The new standard is effective for the Company in its fiscal year 2018 and permits the use of either the retrospective
or a cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures. The Company anticipates using the modified retrospective approach and intends to engage a consultant to assist the Company
with implementation of this standard.

In August 2015,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of Update
2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit
plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the
guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier
as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. All other entities also may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after
December 15, 2016, and 2 interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting
period in which the entity first applies the guidance in Update 2014-09. The new standard is effective for the Company in its fiscal year 2018 and permits the use of either the retrospective
or a cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures. The Company anticipates using the modified retrospective approach and intends to engage a consultant to assist the Company
with implementation of this standard.

In February
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The ASU also will require disclosures
designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company’s
financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which involve several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. The
amendments in this update are effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods. Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual
reporting period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the
beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments
in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In August
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flow Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,
which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are
effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
periods within annual periods. Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual reporting period. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In January
2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which
requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a
single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities is
not a business. The guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition
of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in ASC 606. The amendments in the update are effective
for the Company’s financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the
Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.


In January
2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill
Impairment, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of today’s
goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based
on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on
today’s Step 1). The standard in this update is effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning in 2020. Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after
January 1, 2017. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of
operations or financial position.

Forward-Looking
Statements

This Annual
Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking
statements include statements regarding management’s belief that the Company maintains sufficient supplies to fulfill its
immediate needs and to alleviate potential short-term shortages in such supplies; environmental remediation costs estimated to
be incurred are not material to the Company’s financial condition or operating results; management’s belief in the
adequacy of the Company’s facilities to meet its future needs; the outcome of litigation, as discussed in the Legal Proceedings
section and elsewhere, and the Company’s belief that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; the Company’s expectation to continue its payment of cash dividends;
plans regarding acquisitions; the adequacy of the Company’s resources and borrowings to fund operations, obligations, and
expansions; management’s belief that any additional pension plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company’s
financial position, results of operation or liquidity; the Company’s projected 2017 capital expenditures; the plans to grow
the business in foreign markets through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings and through acquisitions of unrelated
companies; the Company’s expectation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in its Revolving Credit Agreement
throughout 2017; the impact and amount of the Company’s contractual obligations; management’s expectations regarding
termite claims and factors that impact future costs from those claims; the expected cost of termite renewals; the expected collectability
of accounts receivable; expected tax consequences; expectations and plans regarding any losses from franchisees; the impact of
recent accounting pronouncements; and interest rate risks and foreign exchange currency risk on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and liquidity. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated
by the forward-looking statements because of various risks, timing and uncertainties including, without limitation, the possibility
of an adverse ruling against the Company in pending litigation; general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry
practices or technologies; the degree of success of the Company’s termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment
methods; the Company’s ability to identify potential acquisitions; climate and weather trends; competitive factors and pricing
practices; potential increases in labor costs; and changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental
regulations. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases
the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated
by the forward-looking statements.

Quantitative
                                         and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market
Risk

The Company
maintains an investment portfolio subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company is also subject to interest rate
risk exposure through borrowings on its $175 million credit facility. Currently, the Company has no outstanding borrowings. However,
the Company does maintain approximately $35.0 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is also exposed to market risks arising
from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material effect
upon the Company’s results of operations or financial position going forward. For a discussion of the Company’s activities
to manage risks relative to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, see note 10 to the accompanying financial statements.


MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the
Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The management
of Rollins, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.
Rollins, Inc. maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost,
that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon
to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training
of qualified personnel. This system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting,
as of December 31, 2016 based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management’s assessment is that Rollins,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.

The
independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2016, and has also issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting, included in this report on page 23.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Board of Directors and Stockholders’

Rollins, Inc.

We have audited the internal control over financial
reporting of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016, based
on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established
in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our report dated February 24, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE

Board of Directors and Stockholders’

Rollins, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial position of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. Our audits of the basic consolidated financial statements
included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)2. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rollins, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 24, 2017 expressed
an unqualified opinion.

SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business
Description

—Rollins, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the
state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The Company
is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in North America, Australia, and Europe with
international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, Canada,
Australia, and Mexico. Services are performed through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin,
LLC. (“Orkin”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world’s largest pest and termite
control company. It provides customized services from over 400 locations. Orkin either serves customers, directly or through franchise
operations, in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa,
and Mexico providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses,
including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under
the Orkin

®

, and Orkin Canada

®

trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin

®

brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand
name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin Canada,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada’s largest pest control
provider and a leader in the development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western Pest Services (“Western”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was
acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service company and its business complements
most of the services Orkin offers, focusing on the northeastern United States.

The Industrial
Fumigant Company (“IFC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam Pest
Defense (“HomeTeam”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc.
in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its unique Taexx

®

tubes in the wall pest control
system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services
home builders nationally.

Rollins Australia
(“Rollins Australia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (“Allpest”), in February
2014. Allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in Perth, Australia. Allpest provides traditional commercial, residential,
and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to Australia’s biosecurity program and provides
specialized services to Australia’s mining and oil and gas sectors.

Rollins Wildlife
Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Critter Control on February 27, 2015. Critter Control was established
by 1983 and has operations in 40 states and 2 Canadian provinces.

Rollins UK was
formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to acquire Safeguard Pest Control (“Safeguard”). Safeguard, which
was acquired in June 2016, is a pest control company established in the United Kingdom in 1991 with a history of providing superior
pest control, bird control, and specialist services to residential and commercial customers.

The Company
has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues.

The Company
has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for
this segment, includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean,
Europe, Africa, and Mexico. The Company’s results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single
customer, few customers or foreign operations.

Principles
of Consolidation

— The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Rollins, Inc. and
our wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).
The Company does not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership interest of 50% or
less. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest
entity. Accordingly, the Company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. The Company reclassified certain prior period
amounts, none of which were material, to conform to the current period presentation. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.

Subsequent
Events

—The Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. As of
the filing date, February 24, 2017, there were no subsequent events that would affect the Company’s financial statements.

Estimates
Used in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.


Revenue
Recognition

— The Company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services
are performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing
services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring
in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments
within a given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the
time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full
year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered.
The Company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite
baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting
services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the
monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the
contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis
over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing
monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the estimated relative selling price.
There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting
renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing
of performing the required monitoring visits.

Revenue
received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term;
and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding
claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information.
The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an
insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the
future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue
are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared
to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.

All revenues
are reported net of sales taxes.

The Company’s
foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% of revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and 8% for
the year ended December 2014. Currency exchange translation and increases in $US revenues are the cause of the decreased percentage
from 2014.

Interest
income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. Recognition of initial
franchise fee revenues occurs when all material services or conditions relating to a new agreement have been substantially performed
or satisfied by the Company, and initial franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial Position
until such time. Royalties from franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis. Gains on sales
of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability
of accounts receivable.  Management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine
the expected collectability of accounts receivable.  Substantially all of the Company’s receivables are due from pest
control and termite services in the United States and selected international locations.  The Company’s allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability.
The Company’s established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk
customers. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written-off
against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts
previously written off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the
period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. There were
no large recoveries in 2016, 2015, and 2014.  We record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer’s inability
to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating
results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables
would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

— The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates
fair market value.

The Company’s
$142.8 million of total cash at December 31, 2016, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $54.4
million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $88.4 million is primarily held in Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times
may exceed federally insured amounts.

The Company’s
international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment
of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

The Company
maintains a large cash position in the United States while having no third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate liquidity
and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations
and to fund expansion of its domestic business for the foreseeable future.

Marketable
Securities

— From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial
institutions. The Company’s investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than “investment
grade” by national rating services.

Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of
each balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to
hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in
value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included as a component of interest income.

The Company
had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined benefit pension plan and the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan at December 31, 2016 and 2015. See note 14 for further details.

Materials
and Supplies

—Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Income
Taxes

-The Company provides for income taxes based on FASB ASC topic 740

“Income Taxes”,

which requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The Company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it is
determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. The Company establishes additional
provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions
that do not meet the minimum probability threshold. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income
tax matters in income tax expense.

Equipment
and Property

—Equipment and Property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are provided principally
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are computed
using the following asset lives: buildings, ten to forty years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, two to ten years.
Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are
eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. The annual
provisions for depreciation, below, have been reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item entitled Depreciation
and Amortization.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets -

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 350,

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”

,
the Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization;
(2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. The Company does not amortize intangible
assets with indefinite lives and goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic
downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. The Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the Company
level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with
its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, then the Company will compare the
implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill
is less than its carrying value.  The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing
the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge
if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its most recent annual impairment
analyses as of September 30, 2016. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its
goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated.


Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets -

In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 360,

“Property, Plant and Equipment”

,
the Company’s long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair
value of the asset. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets,
including customer contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Insurance

—The
Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’ compensation and vehicle
liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical
trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future
periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent third
party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The
actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management’s knowledge of changes in business
practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of
factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication
of future events.

Accrual
for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors
that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual
number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible
to precisely predict future significant claims. An accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and
long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Contingency
Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.
In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

management estimates and accrues for its liability
and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because
it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities
and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued.
However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued
liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Three-for-two
stock split

-The Board of Directors at its quarterly meeting on January 27, 2015, authorized a three-for-two stock split
by the issuance on March 10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at February 10, 2015.
All share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are restated for the three-for-two
stock split.

Earnings
Per Share -

the FASB ASC Topic 260-10

“Earnings Per Share-Overall,”

requires a basic earnings per
share and diluted earnings per share presentation. Further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is
required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.

The Company
has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered
participating securities. See note 15 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.

The basic and
diluted calculations are the same as there were no stock options included in diluted earnings per share as we have no stock options
outstanding. Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the respective periods.


A reconciliation
of weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common stock (participating
securities) is as follows (in thousands except per share data). All share and per share information in the following chart are
restated for the stock split effective March 10, 2015:

Translation
of Foreign Currencies

—Assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated
into U.S. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates
for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from
foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign
currency are included in the earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based
Compensation

— The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718 “

Compensation
– Stock Compensation

.” Time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management
employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive Plan.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain
stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. Outstanding TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments
starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive
all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued
provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.
The fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years.

Comprehensive
Income (Loss)

—Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) results from foreign currency translations and minimum pension liability
adjustments.


Franchising
Program

– Rollins’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, had 50, 51 and 55 domestic franchises as of December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Transactions with Orkin’s domestic franchises involve sales of customer contracts to
establish new Orkin franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts and initial Orkin franchise fees
are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods ranging up to five years. Notes receivable from Orkin
franchises were $5.0 million at December 31, 2016 and $4.4 million at December 31, 2015. These amounts are included as financing
receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

All Orkin domestic
franchises have a guaranteed repurchase clause that the Orkin franchise may be repurchased by Orkin at a later date once it has
been established; therefore, initial Orkin domestic franchise fees are deferred in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,” for the duration of the initial contract period and are included as unearned
revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Deferred Orkin franchise fees were $3.0 million, $2.9 million, and
$3.0 million at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Royalties from
Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,”
as revenues are earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from Orkin franchises was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
and $4.9 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

As of December
31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Orkin had 70, 48, and 37 international franchises, respectively. Orkin’s international franchise
program began with its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean,
the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico.

The Company’s
maximum exposure to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to the Orkin franchises was
$2.0 million, $1.5 million, and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Rollins’
wholly-owned subsidiary, Rollins Wildlife Services, had 94 and 108 Critter Control franchises in the United States and Canada
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Transactions with Critter Control franchises involve sales of territories to establish
new franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The territories and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination
of cash and notes. Notes receivable from franchises were $0.3 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
These notes are not guaranteed.  The Company anticipates that should there be any losses from franchisees these losses would
be recouped by removing the individual franchisee and re-selling the abandoned territory. These amounts are included as financing
receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Royalties from
franchises are accrued and recognized in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,”
as revenues are earned on a monthly basis.

New
Accounting Standards

Recently
adopted accounting standards

In May 2015,
the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments
in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (“ASU 2015-07”). Under the guidance,
investments measured at NAV, as a practical expedient for fair value, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Removing investments
measured using the practical expedient from the fair value hierarchy is intended to eliminate the diversity in practice that currently
exists with respect to the categorization of these investments. The new guidance is effective in 2017, however early adoption
is permitted. We have elected to early adopt ASU 2015-07 retrospectively for the investments eligible for the NAV practical expedient.

In November
2015, the FASB issued ASU No. (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update
apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities
and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments
in this update. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application
is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this update may
be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We have
elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 retrospectively in the first quarter of 2016. As a result, we have presented all deferred tax
assets and liabilities as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheets, and have reclassified current deferred tax assets and
liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. There was no net impact on our results of operations as
a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-17.

Recently
issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2017 or later

In May
2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount
of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace
most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral
of this standard, with a revised effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted,
although not prior to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits either of the following transition
methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the
option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting
ASU 2014 – 09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). The new standard is effective for the Company in its fiscal year 2018 and permits the use of either the retrospective
or a cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures. The Company anticipates using the modified retrospective approach and intends to engage a consultant to assist the Company
with implementation of this standard.


In August 2015,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of Update
2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit
plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the
guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier
as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. All other entities also may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after
December 15, 2016, and 2 interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting
period in which the entity first applies the guidance in Update 2014-09. The new standard is effective for the Company in its fiscal year 2018 and permits the use of either the retrospective
or a cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures. The Company anticipates using the modified retrospective approach and intends to engage a consultant to assist the Company
with implementation of this standard.

In February
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The ASU also will require disclosures
designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company’s
financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which involve several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. The
amendments in this update are effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods. Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual
reporting period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the
beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments
in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flow Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which
addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash
receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective
for the Company’s financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within annual periods. Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual reporting period. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In January
2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which
requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a
single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities is
not a business. The guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition
of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in ASC 606. The amendments in the update are effective
for the Company’s financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the
Company’s reported results of operations or financial position.

In January
2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill
Impairment, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of today’s
goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based
on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on
today’s Step 1). The standard in this update is effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning in 2020. Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after
January 1, 2017. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of
operations or financial position.

DEBT

On
October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured
line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline
subfacility. The Credit Agreement was amended on October 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2018 and add three
optional one year extensions. On October 27, 2015 the Company exercised a one year extension option to extend the maturity date
to October 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility.
The Company maintains approximately $35.0 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company’s
fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company’s self-insured status, to secure various workers’
compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources
and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.

The Revolving
Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins’ domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is
October 31, 2019, subject to up to two optional extensions of the Credit Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the
Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company’s election:

·

the
                                         Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative
                                         Agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal
                                         Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals
                                         LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the
                                         U.S. Federal Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month,

plus

1.0% per annum.

·

with
                                         respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus an additional amount,
                                         which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon Rollins’ then-current debt-to-EBITDA
                                         ratio. As of December 31, 2015, the additional rate allocated was .75%.

The Revolving
Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including
covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell
substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants restricting
the Company’s ability to permit the ratio of the Company’s consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The Company
was in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2016 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2017.

TRADE
                                         RECEIVABLES

The Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency aging totals,
based on contractual terms, for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company policies
that are specific to pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

FINANCING
                                         RECEIVABLES

Rollins manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks.
The Company’s credit risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising Rollins’ customer base and dispersion
across many different geographical regions. The credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based
on an assessment of the individual’s Beacon/credit bureau score. Rollins requires a potential obligor to have good credit
worthiness with low risk before entering into a contract. Depending upon the individual’s credit score the Company may accept
with 100% financing or require a significant down payment or turndown the contract. Delinquencies of accounts are monitored each
month. Financing receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet
dates.

Total
financing receivables, net were $32.7 million and $27.5 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Financing
receivables are generally charged-off when deemed uncollectable or when 180 days have elapsed since the date of the last full
contractual payment. The Company’s charge-off policy has been consistently applied during the periods reported. Management
considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Gross charge-offs
as a percentage of average financing receivables were 3.2% and 3.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. Due to the low percentage of charge-off receivables and the high credit worthiness of the potential obligor,
Management considers the entire Rollins, Inc. financing receivables portfolio has a low credit risk.

The
Company offers 90 days same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their credit worthiness. Interest is not recognized until
the 91st day at which time it is recognized retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. In
certain circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest
when they reach 180 days past due. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were ten and seven accounts that are greater than 180
days past due, respectively, which have been fully reserved.

Included
in financing receivables are notes receivable from franchise owners. The majority of these notes are low risk as the repurchase
of these franchises is guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, Inc., and the repurchase price of the
franchise is currently estimated and has historically been well above the receivable due from the franchise owner. Also included
in notes receivables are franchise notes from other brands which are not guaranteed and do not have the same historical valuation.

The carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates
for these types of contracts. Long-term installment receivables, net were $16.7 million and $13.6 million at December 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively.

Rollins’
wholly-owned subsidiary, Rollins Wildlife Services, had 94 and 108 Critter Control franchises in the United States and Canada
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Transactions with franchises involve sales of territories to establish new franchises,
initial franchise fees and royalties. The territories and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash
and notes. Notes receivable from franchises were $0.3 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These
notes are not guaranteed.  The Company anticipates that should there be any losses from franchisees these losses would be
recouped by removing the individual franchisee and re-selling the abandoned territory. These amounts are included as financing
receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Royalties from
franchises are accrued and recognized in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 952-605

“Franchisor Revenue Recognition

,”
as revenues are earned on a monthly basis.

Rollins
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to insure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The
allowance balance is comprised of a general reserve, which is determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance,
and a specific reserve, which is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy
or other events, that make it unlikely that Rollins will recover its investment. The general reserve percentages are based on
several factors, which include consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted-average
risk rating of the portfolio and information derived from competitive benchmarking.

FAIR
                                         VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company’s
financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable,
and other short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values. The Company
has financial instruments related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed in note 14.

The fair value
hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values
determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant
other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.

$42.4 million. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies had a net realizable value of $15.7 million and $13.9
million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total deferred compensation plan assets, recorded in other assets on the
Company’s consolidated statements of financial position, were $15.9 million and $14.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

GOODWILL

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill
was $255.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and $249.9 million as of December 31, 2015. Goodwill increased for the year ended December
31, 2016 due primarily to acquisitions, partially offset by currency conversion of foreign goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill
in foreign countries was $42.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and $36.9 million as of December 31, 2015. The changes in the carrying
amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

CUSTOMER
                                         CONTRACTS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Customer
contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio
that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance
with the FASB ASC Topic 350

“Intangibles - Goodwill and other”,

the expected lives of customer contracts were
reviewed, and it was determined that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of 7 to 20 years dependent upon customer
type. The carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:

DERIVATIVE
                                         INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Risk Management Objective
of Using Derivatives

The Company
is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. To manage this risk, the Company
enters into derivative financial instruments from time to time. Certain of the Company’s foreign operations expose the Company
to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of the Company’s cash
receipts and payments in terms of the Company’s functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments
from time to time to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional currency, the U.S.
dollar.

Hedges
of Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company
is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency, the US dollar. The Company uses foreign
currency derivatives, specifically vanilla foreign currency forwards, to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the USD-CAD and
AUD-USD exchange rates. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the foreign currency exchange rate for delivery of a specified
amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in US dollars for their
fair value at or close to their settlement date.

The Company
does not currently designate any of these foreign exchange forwards under hedge accounting, but rather reflects the changes in
fair value immediately in earnings. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company’s
exposure to foreign exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded
directly in earnings and were equal to a net loss of $0.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. As of December
31, 2016, the Company had no outstanding derivatives.

The provision
for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.8% on income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The effective rate differs from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes and the
increase of available foreign tax credit.

For 2015 and
2014 the effective tax rate was 37.4% and 37.3%, respectively. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory
tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes and the release of certain deferred tax liabilities.

During 2016,
2015 and 2014, the Company paid income taxes of $88.8 million, $82.7 million and $74.5 million, respectively, net of refunds.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities
at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

As of
December 31, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately
$191.3 million, which will be available to offset future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between
2017 and 2029. Management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $29.6 million of foreign net operating
losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards.
The valuation allowance increased by $2.5 million due to the foreign net operating losses.

Earnings from
continuing operations before income tax include foreign income of $6.4 million in 2016, $17.0 million in 2015 and $16.2 million
in 2014. The Company’s international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in
the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisition of unrelated companies. Repatriation
of cash from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not part of the Company’s current business plan.

The total amount
of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $0.0 million. A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company
and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various state and international jurisdictions that are currently under audit for
years ranging from 2010 through 2014. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S.,
income tax examinations for years prior to 2012.

It is
reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase in the next 12 months.

The Company’s
policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties
were $0.4 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company recognized interest
and penalties of $0.1 million, $0.2 million, and $0.1 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

ACCRUAL
                                         FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In accordance
with the FASB ASC Topic 450

“Contingencies,”

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing
the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative
to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

In the
normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations
which allege that the subsidiaries’ services caused damage.  In addition, the Company defends employment related cases
and claims from time to time. We are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business.
We are actively contesting each of these matters.


On December
2, 2014, Plaintiff Killian Pest Control sued Rollins, Inc. and its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense alleging that HomeTeam’s
exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, and California’s
Cartwright Act and Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates
the Sherman and Cartwright Acts, and the Business and Professions Code; a permanent injunction against continuing alleged violations;
and monetary damages. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. Because discovery
remains open and there are unresolved questions of fact and law, the Company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, and intends
to defend this matter vigorously.

On December
2, 2014, Plaintiff Jose Luis Garnica, on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated customers, sued Rollins, Inc. and
its subsidiary HomeTeam Pest Defense alleging that HomeTeam’s exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system
violates the federal Sherman Antitrust Act. A second Plaintiff, Cora Potter, subsequently was added. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory
judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the Sherman Act; a permanent injunction against continuing violations; and monetary
damages. On February 3, 2017, the Court issued an order denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification. At a hearing
on February 9, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffs leave to seek certification of a class of customers limited to their own geographic
market, the Bakersfield, California area. The lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California.
Because discovery remains open and there are unresolved questions of fact and law, the Company cannot currently estimate the loss,
if any, and intends to defend this matter vigorously.

Management does
not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome
of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual
quarter or year.

EMPLOYEE
                                         BENEFIT PLANS

Defined
Benefit Pension Plans

Rollins,
Inc. Retirement Income Plan

The Company
maintains several noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”) covering employees meeting
certain age and service requirements. The Plans provide benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five years
during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated Social
Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plans with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company made contributions
of $3.3 million, $5.0 million and $5.3 million to the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively.

In 2005,
the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan, although the Company remains obligated
to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005.  In 2014, the Plan was amended to allow certain vested participants
the ability to elect for a limited time the commencement of their benefit in the form of a single-sum payment, not to exceed $22,000,
or an annuity starting date of December 1, 2014.  In total $6.3 million was paid by the Plan during the year ended December
31, 2014, under this program.  The Plan did not offer any options for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

The Company
includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan in the Company’s financial statements. The Company accounts
for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation- Retirement Benefits”, and
engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the
significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and
other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.


In June
2005, the Company froze the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit pension plan. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement
date for its defined benefit post-retirement plans. The funded status of the Plans and the net amount recognized in the statement
of financial position are summarized as follows as of:

respectively. Accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the same for the Plans. Pre-tax (increases)/decreases
in the pension liability which were (charged, net of tax) credited to other comprehensive income/ (loss) were $3.0 million, $14.8
million, and $(41.7) million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

The return
on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments
held in the plan. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns
on the plan investments.

The discount
rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year.  In
estimating this rate, for fiscal year’s 2016, 2015, and 2014 the Company utilized a yield curve analysis.

For each of
the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical – maximize the long-term rate of return on
plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits.  The investment
policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans utilize a number of investment
approaches, including individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable,
and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. The Company and management are considering making contributions to the pension
plans of approximately $5.5 million during fiscal 2017.

Some of our
assets, primarily our private equity

,

real estate, and hedge funds, do not have readily determinable
market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments.  For the December 31,
2016 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible.  For assets without readily determinable
values, estimates were derived from investment manager statements combined with

discussions
focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.

Additionally, these investments
are categorized as NAV investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable
fair value.  In accordance with ASU No. 2011-12 “Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per
Share (Or Its Equivalent),” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds
in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect,
resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating
the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’
financial statements for reasonableness

.


Fair Value
Measurements

The Company’s
overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 70 percent of investments for long-term growth and 30 percent
for near-term benefit payments, with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers.  Equity securities
primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies

domiciled domestically
and

internationally.  Fixed-income securities include corporate bonds, mortgage-backed
securities,

sovereign bonds

,

and U.S. Treasuries. 
Other types of investments include real estate

funds and private equity funds that follow
several different investment strategies. For each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical
– maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of
providing pension benefits.  The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced
as required.  The plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including

but not
limited to

individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying
securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation.

The
following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2016. The fair value hierarchy
has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. See note 7 for a brief description of the
three levels under the fair value hierarchy.

In
2016, we elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments
in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share (or Its Equivalent)”. This ASU removes the requirement to categorize
within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured at the net asset value per share practical expedient.
In addition, it also limits disclosure investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using the practical
expedient. The guidance, which required retrospective application, resulted in the reclassification of $18.8 million and $19.4
million of Pension Plan Assets from Level 3 categorization as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Defined Contribution 401(k) Savings
Plan

The Company
sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) Savings Plan that is available to a majority of the Company’s full-time employees
the first day of the calendar quarter following completion of three months of service. The Plan is available to non full-time
employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one year of service upon completion of 1,000 hours in that year. 
The Plan provides for a matching contribution of fifty cents ($.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant’s contributions
to the Plan that do not exceed 6 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses).
The charge to expense for the Company match was approximately $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $10.2 million
and $8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 approximately,
36.4%, 33.5%, and 29.3%, respectively of the plan assets consisted of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total administrative fees paid
by the Company for the Plan were less than $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Plan

The Deferred
Compensation Plan provides that participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual bonus with
respect to any given plan year, subject to a $2 thousand per plan year minimum. The Company may make discretionary contributions
to participant accounts. The Company credited accounts of participants of long service to the Company with certain discretionary
amounts (“Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions”) in lieu of benefits that previously accrued under the Company’s
Retirement Income Plan up to a maximum of $245 thousand.

Accounts
will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain “Measurement
Funds.” Account values are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and Company credits had been converted into shares or
other ownership units of selected Measurement Funds by purchasing (or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current
purchase price of the relevant Measurement Fund at the time of the participant’s selection. Deferred Compensation Plan benefits
are unsecured general obligations of the Company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with the Company’s
other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company has established a “rabbi trust,” which it uses to voluntarily
set aside amounts to indirectly fund any obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the extent that the Company’s obligations
under the Deferred Compensation Plan exceed assets available under the trust, the Company would be required to seek additional
funding sources to fund its liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Generally, the
Deferred Compensation Plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant’s death,
disability, retirement or other termination of employment (a “Termination Event”). However, for any deferrals of salary
and bonus (but not Company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a
Termination Event. Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the
Deferred Compensation Plan in installments or lump-sum payments.

At December
31, 2016 the Deferred Compensation Plan had 70 life insurance policies with a net face value of $42.4 million. The cash surrender
value of these life insurance policies were worth $15.7 million and $13.9 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


The estimated
life insurance premium payments over the next five years are as follows:

Stock Compensation Plans

Time
Lapse Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units

Time lapse restricted
shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Incentive
Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding over the remainder of the service
period. The compensation cost recorded for these awards is based on their closing stock price at the grant date less the cost
of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods to reflect
actual forfeitures. Cash flows related to share-based payment awards to employees that result in tax benefits in excess of recognized
cumulative compensation cost (excess tax benefits) are classified as a financing activity in the accompanying consolidated statements
of cash flows.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company’s Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain
stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting
with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends
declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that
shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

The Company
issued time lapse restricted shares of 0.5 million, 0.7 million, and 0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015,
and 2014, respectively.

The Company
issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2016, approximately 4.7 million shares of the Company’s
common stock were reserved for issuance. In accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718, “

Compensation – Stock Compensation,”

the Company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company
estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.
