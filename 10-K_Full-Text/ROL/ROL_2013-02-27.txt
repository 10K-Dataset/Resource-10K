PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and
commercial customers in North America with international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico. Services are performed
through a contract that specifies the pricing arrangement with the customer.

Orkin, LLC.
("Orkin"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world's largest pest and termite control company. It provides customized services from over 400
locations. Orkin serves customers, either directly or indirectly through franchises, in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe,
Africa and Mexico providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food
manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin operates under the Orkin®, and Orkin Canada® trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The
Orkin® brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the United States. The Orkin Canada brand name provides similar brand recognition throughout Canada.

Orkin
Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada's largest pest control provider and a leader in the development of fast,
effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western
Pest Services ("Western"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service
company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers focusing on the northeastern United States.

The
Industrial Fumigant Company ("IFC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and
sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam
Pest Defense ("HomeTeam"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its
unique Taexx tubes in the wall pest control system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders
nationally.

The
Company has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company's total revenues.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, which includes the United States, Canada,
Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico are included in Item 8 of this document, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" on
pages 34 and 35. The Company's results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer or a few customers or the Company's foreign operations.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

At the July 2012 Board of Directors' meeting, the Board authorized the purchase of 5.0 million shares of the Company's common stock. The
authorized share repurchases are in addition to the Company's existing plan of which 298,183 shares remained available for repurchase as of July 24, 2012. During the years ended



December 31,
2012 and 2011, the Company repurchased 0.8 million and 1.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $20.93 and $18.68, respectively. In total, there are
5.3 million additional shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

Backlog

Backlog services and orders are usually provided within the month following the month of order receipt, except in the area of prepaid pest control
and bait monitoring services, which are usually provided within twelve months of order receipt. The Company does not have a material portion of its business that may be subject to renegotiation of
profits or termination of contracts at the election of a governmental entity.

Orkin Franchises

The Company continues to expand its growth through Orkin's franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently
not economically feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are subject to a contractual buyback provision at Orkin's option with a pre-determined purchase price
using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise. International franchise agreements also contain an
optional buyback provision, however, the franchisee has the prior right of renewal of the agreement. The Company through its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S.
in 1994, and established its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and
Mexico.

Seasonality

The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company's pest and termite control services. The increase in pest pressure and
activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in
the revenue of the Company's pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

Inventories

The Company has relationships with a national pest control product distributor and other vendors for pest and termite control treatment products.
Rollins maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability
from its national network of suppliers.

Competition

The Company believes that Rollins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, Orkin Canada, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest Services, The
Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services and TruTech competes favorably with competitors as the world's largest pest and termite control company. The Company's competitors
include Terminix, Ecolab and Rentokil.

The
principal methods of competition in the Company's pest and termite control business are quality of service and guarantees, including money-back guarantees on pest and termite control,
and the termite re-treatment and damage repair guarantee to qualified homeowners.

Research and Development

Expenditures by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and
improved service methods and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies. Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the
specifications provided by the Company.

The
Company maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection.

The
Company conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products. The Company also works closely with leading entomologists, industry consultants and suppliers to improve
service protocols and materials.

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

The Company's pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment, public
health and consumers. Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act ("FIFRA")

This federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control
companies operate. Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the following:
licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This allows each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in
keeping with special interests of the citizens' wishes in each state. The pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 ("FQPA")

The FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts its
business.



Environmental Remediation

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as Superfund, is the primary Federal statute
regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of
hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous substances, and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will work with the EPA
and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Consistent with the Company's responsibilities under these regulations, the Company
undertakes environmental assessments and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these situations arise, the Company
accrues management's best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management's current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the Company's
financial condition or operating results.

Employees

The number of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2013 was approximately 10,500.

Available Information

Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K
and amendments to these reports, are available free of charge on our web site at www.rollins.com as soon as reasonably
practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1.A.    Risk Factors

We may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the competitive pest control industry in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitive prices, and general economic issues.
We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the
market areas that we serve are service quality and product and availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe that our experience and
reputation for safety and quality service is excellent, we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.

Economic conditions may adversely affect our business

Pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to most of our residential customers. As consumers restrict their discretionary
expenditures, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and
food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or
cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.



We may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.

Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify and
acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business
with our own business. Any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.

Our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions across the United States and Canada. The business of the Company is affected by the
seasonal nature of the Company's pest and termite control services. The increase in pest pressure and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of
which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the Company's pest and termite control operations during such
periods. The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods.

Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.

Our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand
our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for skilled employees is high, and the supply is very limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by
competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in wage rates paid by us, or both. If either of these events occurred, our capacity and profitability could be
diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.

Our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.

In the normal course of business, some of the Company's subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that
plaintiffs have been damaged. The
Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position; however, it is
possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year.

Our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.

Our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws
and the level of enforcement of such laws. We are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies
or court rulings, or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted. We believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and
regulations. We also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. We are unable to
predict whether environmental laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses,
fines, and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.



The Company's Management Has a Substantial Ownership Interest; Public Stockholders May Have No Effective Voice In the Company's Management

The Company has elected the "Controlled Company" exemption under rule 303A of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Company Guide. The Company
is a "Controlled Company" because a group that includes the Company's Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins and his brother, Gary W. Rollins, who is the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
also a director of the Company and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company's voting power. As a "Controlled Company," the Company need not comply with
certain NYSE rules.

Rollins, Inc.'s
executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 57 percent of the Company's
outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate
transactions such as acquisitions and approval
of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.

Item 1.B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None

Item 2.    Properties.

The Company's administrative headquarters are owned by the Company, and are located at 2170 Piedmont Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30324. The Company
owns or leases over 500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the Rollins Training Center located in Atlanta, Georgia, the Rollins Customer Service Center located in
Covington, Georgia, and the Pacific Division Administration and Training Center in Riverside, California. None of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important
physical property of the Company. The facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the Company.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of business, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that
plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services by the defendant subsidiary. The subsidiaries are actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits have been filed
(

John Maciel v. Orkin, Inc., et al.; Douglas F. Bracho, Jr. v. Orkin, Inc.;

Jennifer M. Welsh et al. v. Orkin, LLC, et al.:

and

Jennifer Thompson and
Janet
Flood v. Philadelphia Management Company, Parkway Associated, Parkway House Apartments, Barbara Williams, and Western Pest Services

) in which the plaintiffs are
seeking certification of a class. These cases originate in California (

Maciel and Bracho

), South Carolina
(

Welsh

), and Pennsylvania (

Flood

),
respectively. The

Maciel

lawsuit, a wage and hour related matter, was filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County,
California. The

Bracho

lawsuit, a matter related to payroll deductions for use of Company vehicles, was filed in the
Superior Court of Orange County, California. In

Bracho

, the Court in early October approved a final resolution of this
matter, and on October 15, 2012, it was dismissed. The

Welsh

lawsuit, a termite service related matter, was filed in
the Court of Common Pleas Fourteenth Judicial Circuit, County of Beaufort, South Carolina. The

Flood

lawsuit, a bed bug
service related matter filed by residents of an apartment complex, was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. On October 26, 2012, the Court approved a
settlement of the

Flood

case, and it was dismissed with prejudice. None of the remaining matters have been scheduled for a
class certification hearing. Additionally, the Company and a subsidiary, The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC, are named defendants in

Severn
Peanut Co. and Meherrin Agriculture & Chemical Co. v. Industrial Fumigant Co., et al

. The

Severn

lawsuit, a matter related to a fumigation
service, has been filed in the Northern Division of the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of



North
Carolina. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for breach of contract and negligence. The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC is also a named defendant in

Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania as Subrogee of
Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Agrinational Insurance Company, Inc. as Subrogee of
Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company v. The Industrial Fumigant Co., The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC, and James
Miller

. The

ADM

lawsuit, a matter related to a fumigation service, has been filed in
the State Court in Lucas County, Ohio. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for breach of contract and negligence. The Company believes these matters are without merit and intends to vigorously contest
certification and defend itself through trial or arbitration, if necessary. Management does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely,
could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

Orkin, LLC
is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company's liability under any of these matters
would not and did not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 4    Mine Safety Disclosures.

As

General Operating Comments

2012 marked the Company's 15th consecutive year of reporting improved results, with 2012 concluding with record revenues and profits. Last
year (2012) the Company's revenue grew 5.5%, with growth in all lines of service.

Results of Operations—2012 Versus 2011

Overview

The Company's gross margin increased to 49.0% for 2012 from 48.8% in 2011. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased in 2012 to 32.1% of
revenue versus 32.3% in 2011. The Company experienced a reduction in its depreciation and amortization margin to 3.0% in 2012 versus 3.1% in 2011. The Company had net income of $111.3 million
in 2012 compared to $100.7 million in 2011, a 10.5% increase. Net profit margin improved to 8.8% in 2012 from 8.4% in 2011.



Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $1.3 billion, an increase of $65.8 million or 5.5% from 2011 revenues of
$1.2 billion. Commercial pest control represented approximately 41.0% of the Company's business in 2012 and grew 3.7% in 2012 due to increases in sales, bed bug revenues and an increase in the
average sales price. Residential pest control represented approximately 41.0% of the Company's business and increased 8.0% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing as well as increased capture
of TAEXX homebuilder installations and bed bug revenues. The Company's termite business, which represented approximately 18.0% of the Company's revenue, grew 4.0% in 2012 due to increases in ancillary
service sales as well as the Company's expanded sales force and price increases.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Company established new franchises in Mexico, China, Turks
and Caicos Islands and Chile for a total of 22 and 18 international franchises at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Orkin had 79 and 76 total domestic and international franchises at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 cost of services provided increased $30.8 million or 5.0%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2011. Gross margin for the year was 49.0% for 2012 and 48.8% for 2011. While all costs increased during the year due to the Company's early 2012 and late 2011 acquisitions,
insurance and claims expense increased but was partially offset by lower termite provision claims and telephone costs were down marginally due to cost controls, partially offset by higher personnel
related costs including payroll taxes and group premiums.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, depreciation and amortization increased $1.2 million, or 3.1% compared to the twelve
months ended December 31, 2011. The increase is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in late 2011 and early 2012 partially offset by several intangible assets being fully
amortized.

Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $18.8 million, or 4.8%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 representing 32.1% of revenues compared to 32.3% of revenues in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased due to
reductions in professional services due to timing of projects and reduced salaries as a percentage of revenues as the Company continues to maximize efficiency in its workforce.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $14 thousand, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to
$0.5 million in 2011 due to the pay-off of the remainder of the Company's outstanding borrowings in 2011.

Pension Settlement

Management terminated its wholly-owned subsidiary's (Waltham Services, LLC) salaried pension plan and recorded a settlement loss, which
resulted in an additional expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.



(Gain)/loss on Sales/Impairment of assets, Net

(Gain)/Loss on Sales/Impairment of assets, net increased to $0.5 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to
$0.4 million loss in 2011. The Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and property in Canada in 2012 while recognizing an impairment on software related to terminated projects
for approximately $0.5 million in 2011.

Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate was 37.0% in 2012 compared to 37.5% in 2011, due primarily to differences in state tax rates.

Results of Operations—2011 Versus 2010

Overview

The Company's gross margin increased slightly to 48.8% for 2011 from 48.7% in 2010. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased in 2011 to
32.3% of revenue versus 32.8% in 2010. The Company experienced a reduction in its depreciation and amortization margin to 3.1% in 2011 versus 3.2% in 2010 due to several assets being fully
depreciated, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2010. The Company had net income of $100.7 million compared to $90.0 million in 2010, an 11.9% increase.
Net profit margin improved to 8.4% in 2011 from 7.9% in 2010.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $68.2 million or 6.0% from 2010 revenues of
$1.1 billion. Commercial pest control represented approximately 42.0% of the Company's business in 2011 and grew 6.0% in 2011 due to increases in sales, bed bug revenues and revenues from 2010
acquisitions. Residential pest control represented approximately 40.0% of the Company's business and increased 7.7% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing. The Company's termite business,
which represented approximately 18.0% of the Company's revenue, grew 2.8% in 2011 due to increases in ancillary services sales as well as the Company's expanded sales force and price increases.

The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company established new franchises in China and two
locations in Nigeria for a total of 18 and 16 international franchises at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Orkin had 76 and 72 total domestic and international franchises at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Cost of Services Provided

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 cost of services provided increased $33.8 million or 5.8%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2010. Gross margin for the year was 48.8% for 2011 and 48.7% for 2010. While all costs increased during the year due to the Company's 2010 acquisitions and fleet expenses
were marginally better due to better routing and scheduling.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, depreciation and amortization increased $1.1 million, or 3.0% compared to the twelve
months ended December 31, 2010. The increase is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2010, partially offset by several assets being fully depreciated.



Sales, General and Administrative

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $15.4 million, or 4.1%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 representing 32.3% of revenues compared to 32.8% of revenues in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased due to
reductions in professional services related to the Company's 2010 pricing study and reduced salaries as a percentage of revenues as the Company continues to maximize efficiency in its workforce.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $0.5 million, an increase of $0.1 million compared to
$0.4 million in 2010 due interest on acquisition related payables and outstanding debt during the year.

Loss on Sales/Impairment of assets, Net

Loss on Sales/Impairment of assets, net increased to $0.4 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to
$0.1 million loss in 2010. The Company recognized an impairment on software related to terminated projects for approximately $0.5 million in 2011.

Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2011 compared to 37.3% in 2010, due primarily to differences in state tax rates.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

The Company's operations generated cash of $141.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily from net income of
$111.3 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $154.6 million in 2011 and 124.1 million in 2010. The Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents
balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities and available borrowings under its $175.0 million credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current
operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future.

The
Company made contributions totaling $5.2 million to the Rollins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries' defined benefit retirement plans (the "Plans") during the year ended
December 31, 2012 and $4.9 million and $5.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as a result of the Plans' funding status. The Company
is considering making contributions to its Plans of



approximately
$5.0 million during fiscal 2013. In the opinion of management, additional Plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

The Company used $42.7 million on investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $29.2 million and
$47.6 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively, and of that, invested approximately $19.0 million in capital expenditures during 2012 compared to $18.7 million and
$13.0 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology related projects. The
Company expects to invest between $15.0 million and $20.0 million in 2013 in capital expenditures. During 2012, the Company's subsidiaries acquired several small companies totaling
$25.0 million compared to $11.4 million in acquisitions during 2011 and $34.8 million in 2010. The expenditures for the Company's acquisitions were funded with cash on hand. The
Company continues to seek new acquisitions.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities

The Company used cash of $81.0 million on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $99.4 million
and $65.5 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively. A total of $64.3 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.44 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2012 including a
special dividend paid in December 2012 of $0.12 per share, compared to $41.1 million ($0.28 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2011 and $35.5 million ($0.24 per share)
in 2010. The Company used $19.9 million to repurchase 0.9 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $20.93 per share during 2012 compared to $30.2 million
to purchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $18.68 in 2011 and $29.7 million to purchase 1.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $13.95 in 2010. There are
5.3 million shares authorized remaining to be repurchased under prior Board approval.

The
Company's $65.1 million of total cash at December 31, 2012, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $40.9 million is held in cash accounts at
international bank institutions and the remaining $24.2 million is primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks. In July 2010, President Obama signed
into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which again led to changes in FDIC deposit guarantees. Beginning January 1, 2011 and lasting through December 31, 2012, all funds held in
noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at insured depository institutions were automatically fully insured, without limit. This temporary unlimited insurance expired at the end of 2012 and has
reverted to a $250,000 limit per bank.

On
October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which
includes a
$75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. As of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under
the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately $33.2 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company's fronting insurance companies and/or
certain states, due to the Company's self-insured status, to secure various workers' compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate
liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.



The Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins' domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2016, subject to
optional annual extensions on the first three anniversaries of the Credit Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two
rates, at the Company's election:

•

the Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative Agent publicly
announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR
Rate (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the U.S. Federal Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an Interest Period of one (1),

plus

1.0% per
annum.

•

with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, Adjusted LIBOR plus an additional amount, which varies between .75% and 1.00%,
based upon Rollins' then-current debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2012, the additional rate allocated was .75%.

The
Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the Company's ability to incur
certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants
restricting the Company's ability to permit the ratio of the Company's consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The
Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2012 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2013.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results
of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor
and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is
significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company's business practices.
However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. Accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on
the Company's consolidated statements of financial position.

Accrued Insurance

—The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and vehicle
liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported
(although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent
third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration, along with
management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these factors. Management's judgment is inherently
subjective and a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. The Company continues to
be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. Initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor
vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing. The Company has improved
the time required to report a claim by utilizing a "Red Alert" program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty
program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited-duty basis.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain revenue types,
because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are
primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general,
pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for
those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the
discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite
baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the
installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the
contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in
recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. The allocation of the
purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting



other
specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of
performing the required monitoring visits.

At
inception revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon
current factors and historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the
contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable
to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a
provision is made for any expected losses.

All
revenues are reported net of sales taxes.

Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450

"Contingencies,"

Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in
consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with
litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material
adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the
Company's consolidated statements of financial position.

Defined benefit pension plans

—In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit plan, although the Company
remains obligated to provide
employees benefits earned through June 2005. The Company terminated the Waltham Services, LLC Salaried Pension Plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum
in December 2012. The Company also includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan to the Company's financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined benefit plans in
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715

"Compensation-Retirement Benefits"

, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs.
With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other
factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.

The
Company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment
adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses)
ultimately affects future pension expense. The Company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7% which is unchanged from the prior year.

The
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes a yield curve approach.
The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company's expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at
the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result
in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. The discount rate was 4.17% as of December 31, 2012 compared to 5.01% in 2011 and 5.51% in 2010. A lower discount rate
increases the present value of benefit obligation.



As
set forth in note 13 to the Company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan's investments are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments
comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not
have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with ASU No. 2009-12 "

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its
Equivalent),"

these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to
judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating
the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.

As
of December 31, 2012, the defined benefit plans were under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders' equity by $15.4 million
before tax and $9.5 million after tax.

New Accounting Standards

Recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2013

In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")

Disclosures
about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

("ASU 2011-11") to Topic 210, Balance Sheet. The update requires new disclosures about balance sheet offsetting and related
arrangements. For derivatives and financial assets and liabilities, the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts, amounts offset on the balance sheet, and amounts subject to
the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective December 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively. This guidance does not amend the existing
guidance on when it is appropriate to offset; as a result, we do not expect this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements.

In
July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02). This standard provides new accounting guidance
that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it
is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment,
while no further analysis would be required if it passes. The provisions of the new guidance are effective as of the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year; we do not expect the new guidance to have an
impact on the 2013 impairment test results.

In
February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("ASU 2013-02) to topic 220,
Comprehensive Income. The guidance which requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the
respective line items of net income. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2013; we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our financial
statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements include statements regarding the Company's belief that its levels of supplies will alleviate the potential short-term shortage in availability from its
suppliers; management's belief that environmental remediation costs estimated to be incurred are not material to the Company's financial condition or operating results; the outcome of litigation, as
discussed in the Legal Proceedings section and elsewhere, and the Company's belief that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity; the Company's expectation to continue its payment of cash dividends; the adequacy of the



Company's
resources and borrowings to fund operations and obligations; management's belief that any additional pension plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company's financial
position, results of operation or liquidity; the Company's projected 2013 capital expenditures; the Company's expectation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in its Revolving Credit
Agreement throughout 2013; the impact and amount of the Company's contractual obligations; management's expectations regarding termite claims and factors that impact future costs from those claims;
the expected cost of termite renewals; the expected collectability of accounts receivable; expected tax consequences; the impact of recent accounting pronouncements; and interest rate risks and
foreign exchange currency risk on the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the
forward-looking statements because of various risks, timing and uncertainties including, without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling against the Company in pending litigation; general
economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or technologies; the degree of success of the Company's termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods; the
Company's ability to identify potential acquisitions; climate and weather trends; competitive factors and pricing practices; potential increases in labor costs; and changes in various government laws
and regulations, including environmental regulations. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the
risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market Risk

The Company maintains an investment portfolio subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company is also subject to interest
rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175 million credit facility. Currently, the Company has no outstanding borrowings. However, the Company does maintain approximately
$33.2 million in Letters of Credit. The Company is also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will
not have a material effect upon the Company's results of operations or financial position going forward.



MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To
the Stockholders of Rollins, Inc.:

The
management of Rollins, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Rollins, Inc. maintains a system of
internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate
and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The internal control system is augmented by written
policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel. This system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2012 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management's assessment is that Rollins, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2012.

The
independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, and has also
issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, included in this report on page 32.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Board
of Directors and Shareholders

Rollins, Inc.

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Rollins, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2012, and our report dated February 27, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rollins, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, Rollins, Inc. and Subsidiaries

1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business Description

—Rollins, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Rollins
Broadcasting, Inc.

The
Company is an international service company with headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and
commercial customers in North America with domestic franchises and international franchises in Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico.

Orkin, LLC
("Orkin"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1901, is the world's largest pest and termite control company. It provides customized services from over 400 locations.
Orkin serves customers in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico providing essential pest control services and
protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. Orkin
operates under the Orkin®, and Orkin Canada® trademarks and the Acurid

SM

service mark. The Orkin® brand name makes Orkin the most recognized pest and
termite company throughout the United States.

Orkin
Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by Orkin in 1999. Orkin Canada is Canada's largest pest control provider and a leader in the development of fast,
effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.

Western
Pest Services ("Western"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1928, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2004. Western is primarily a commercial pest control service
company and its business complements most of the services Orkin offers focusing on the northeastern United States.

The
Industrial Fumigant Company ("IFC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company founded in 1937, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in 2005. IFC is a leading provider of pest management and
sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.

HomeTeam
Pest Defense ("HomeTeam"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company established in 1996, was acquired by Rollins, Inc. in April 2008. At the time of the acquisition, HomeTeam, with its
unique Taexx tubes in the wall pest control system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. HomeTeam services home builders
nationally.

The
Company has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of total revenues.

The
Company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. Revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, includes the United States, Canada, Central
America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico. The Company's results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer,
few customers or foreign operations.



Principles of Consolidation

—The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Rollins, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries and have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). The Company does not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership
interest of 50% or less. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, the Company has not
consolidated any variable interest entity. The
Company reclassified certain prior period amounts, none of which were material, to conform to the current period presentation. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Subsequent Events

—The Company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. As of the filing date, February 27,
2013, there were no subsequent events that would affect the Company's financial statements.

Estimates Used in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain revenue types,
because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are
primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general,
pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for
those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the
discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.

Termite
baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the
installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the
contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in
recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price.
There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract
period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.

At
inception revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections,
reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon
current factors and historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the
contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable
to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a
provision is made for any expected losses.

All
revenues are reported net of sales taxes.



The
Company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Interest
income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. Recognition of initial franchise fee revenues occurs when all material services
or conditions relating to a new agreement have been substantially performed or satisfied by the Company. Initial franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the Statement of Financial Position
until such time. Royalties from Orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis. Gains on sales of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at
the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Management
uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Substantially all of the Company's receivables are due
from pest control and termite services in the United States and selected international locations. The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure
that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The Company's established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers.
Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company
determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the
period of recovery.
Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. There were no large recoveries in 2012, 2011 and 2010. We record specific provisions when we become
aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If
circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are charged to sales, general and administrative expense during the year in which they are incurred.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Short-term
investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value. At times, cash and cash equivalents may exceed federally insured amounts.

The
Company's $65.1 million of total cash at December 31, 2012, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $40.9 million is held in cash accounts at
international bank
institutions and the remaining $24.2 million is primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks. In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the
Dodd-Frank Act, which again led to changes in FDIC deposit guarantees. Beginning January 1, 2011 and lasting through December 31, 2012, all funds held in noninterest-bearing
transaction accounts at insured depository institutions were automatically fully



insured,
without limit. This temporary unlimited insurance expired at the end of 2012 and has reverted to a $250,000 limit per bank.

Marketable Securities

—From time to time, the Company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company's investment
policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than "investment grade" by national rating services.

Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. Debt securities are
classified as available-for-sale because the Company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized
gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale
securities are included as a component of interest income.

The
Company had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined pension benefit plan and the nonqualified deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2012 and 2011. See
note 13 for further details.

Materials and Supplies

—Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Income Taxes

—The Company provides for income taxes based on FASB ASC topic 740

"Income Taxes",

which requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The Company
provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. The Company establishes additional provisions for
income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain some positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold. The Company's policy is to record
interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Equipment and Property

—Equipment and Property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital
leases and are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are computed using the following
asset lives: buildings, ten to forty years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, two to ten years. Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the
accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. The annual provisions for depreciation, below, have been reflected in the Consolidated Statements of
Income in the line item entitled Depreciation and Amortization:

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

—In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350,

"Intangibles—Goodwill and
other"

, the Company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets
with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and



(3) goodwill.
The Company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Such conditions may include an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. The
Company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the Company level. Such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the Company) with its
carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, then the Company will compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. Impairment losses are
recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. The Company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each
indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. The Company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company completed its most
recent annual impairment analyses as of September 30, 2012. Based upon the results of these analyses, the Company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or other intangible assets was
indicated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

—In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360,

"Property, Plant and Equipment"

,
the Company's long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets,
including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Insurance

—The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and vehicle liability. The
estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual
settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent third party actuary
on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration, along with management's
knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. The reserve is established based on all these factors. Management's judgment is inherently subjective and a
number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events.

Accrual for Termite Contracts

—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor
and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is
significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company's business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant
claims. An accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated statements of financial position.

Contingency Accruals

—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450

"Contingencies,"

Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in
consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with
litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of



management,
the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current
liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated statements of financial position.

Earnings Per Share

—FASB ASC Topic 260-10

"Earnings Per Share-Overall,"

requires a basic earnings per
share and diluted earnings per share presentation. Further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents,
whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.

The
Company has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. See note 13
for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.

The
basic and diluted calculations differ as a result of the dilutive effect of stock options included in diluted earnings per share, but excluded from basic earnings per share. Basic and diluted
earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods.



A reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common stock (participating securities) is as
follows:

Translation of Foreign Currencies

—Assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the
year-end rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other
comprehensive income. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign currency are included in the
earnings of the current period.

Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 713
"

Compensation—Stock Compensation

." Stock options and time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management
employees under the Company's Employee Stock Incentive Plan. The Company's stock options generally vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date.

TLRSs
provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the
terms of the issue. Outstanding TLRSs vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees
receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise
transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed. These awards are amortized, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years.

The
Company has not granted stock options since 2003.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

—Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) results from foreign currency translations and minimum pension liability adjustments.

Franchising Program

—Rollins' wholly-owned subsidiary, Orkin, had 57, 58 and 56 domestic franchises as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Transactions with domestic franchises
involve sales of customer contracts to establish new franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. The customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash
and notes due over periods ranging up to five years. Notes receivable from franchises were $5.1 million at December 31, 2012 and $4.7 million at December 31, 2011. These
amounts are included as financing receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The
Company recognizes gains from the sale of customer contracts at the time they are sold to franchises and collection on the notes is reasonably assured. The Company recognized net gains of
$0.5 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively for the sale of customer contracts. These amounts are
included as revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

All
domestic franchises have a guaranteed repurchase clause that the franchise may be repurchased by Orkin at a later date once it has been established; therefore, initial domestic franchise fees are
deferred in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 952-605

"Franchisor Revenue Recognition

," for the duration of the initial contract period and are
included as unearned revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Deferred franchise fees were $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million at December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Royalties
from franchises are accrued and recognized in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 952-605

"Franchisor Revenue Recognition

," as revenues
are earned on a monthly basis. Revenue from franchises was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $3.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2011
and 2010, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Orkin had 22, 18 and 16 international franchises, respectively. Orkin's international franchise program began with its first international franchise in
2000 and since has



expanded
to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa and Mexico.

The
Company's maximum exposure to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to the franchises was $2.1 million, $1.8 million and $1.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Three-for-Two Stock Split

—The Board of Directors, at its quarterly meeting on October 26, 2010, authorized a
three-for-two stock split by the issuance on December 10, 2010 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at November 10, 2010.
Accordingly, the par value for additional shares issued was adjusted to common stock, and fractional shares resulting from the stock split were settled in cash.

New Accounting Standards

Recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2013

In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")

Disclosures
about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

("ASU 2011-11") to Topic 210, Balance Sheet. The update requires new disclosures about balance sheet offsetting and related
arrangements. For derivatives and financial assets and liabilities, the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts, amounts offset on the balance sheet, and amounts subject to
the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective December 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively. This guidance does not amend the existing
guidance on when it is appropriate to offset; as a result, we do not expect this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements.

In
July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02). This standard provides new accounting guidance
that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it
is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment,
while no further analysis would be required if it passes. The provisions of the new guidance are effective as of the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year; we do not expect the new guidance to have an
impact on the 2013 impairment test results.

In
February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts of Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("ASU 2013-02) to topic 220,
Comprehensive Income. The guidance which requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the
respective line items of net income. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first
quarter of 2013; we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements.

2.     ACQUISITIONS

The Company has made several acquisitions that are not material individually or in total to the Company's consolidated financial statements during the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

3.     DEBT

On October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to
$175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. As of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were
outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately $33.2 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the
Company's fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company's self-insured status,



to
secure various workers' compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such
claims.

The
Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins' domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2016, subject to optional annual extensions
on the first three anniversaries of the Credit Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company's
election:

•

the Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative Agent publicly
announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate,

plus

0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR
Rate (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the U.S. Federal Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an Interest Period of one (1),

plus

1.0% per
annum.

•

with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, Adjusted LIBOR plus an additional amount, which varies between .75% and 1.00%,
based upon Rollins' then-current debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2012, the additional rate allocated was .75%.

The
Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the Company's ability to incur
certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants
restricting the Company's ability to permit the ratio of the Company's consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits.

The
Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2012 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2013.

4.     TRADE RECEIVABLES

The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency aging totals, based on contractual terms,
for the various categories of receivables. Bad debt write-offs occur according to Company policies that are specific to pest control, commercial and termite accounts.

5.     FINANCING RECEIVABLES

Rollins manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. The Company's credit risk is generally low with a large number of
entities comprising Rollins' customer base and dispersion across many different geographical regions. The credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an
assessment of the individual's beacon/credit bureau score. Rollins requires potential obligor to have good credit worthiness with low risk before entering into a contract. Depending upon the
individual's credit score the Company may accept with 100% financing, require a significant down payment or turn down the contract. Delinquencies of accounts are monitored



each
month. Financing receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.

Total
financing receivables, net were $23.5 million and $23.0 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Financing receivables are
charged-off when deemed
uncollectable or when 180 days have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment. The Company's charge-off policy has been consistently applied and no significant
changes have been made to the policy during the periods reported. Management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Charge-offs as a percentage of average financing receivables were 2.6%, 3.0% and 4.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Due to the low
percentage of charge-off receivables and the high credit worthiness of the potential obligor, the entire Rollins, Inc. financing receivables portfolio has a low credit risk.

The
Company offers 90 days same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their credit worthiness. Interest is not recognized until the 91

st

day
at which time it is recognized retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. In certain circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative
nature, accounts may still accrue interest when they reach 180 days past due. As of December 31, 2012, there were no accounts on a non-accrual status, and no financing
receivables greater than 180 days past due.

Included
in financing receivables are notes receivable from franchise owners. These notes are low risk as the repurchase of these franchises is guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,
Orkin, LLC, and the repurchase price of the franchise is currently estimated and have historically been well above the receivable due from the franchise owner.

The
carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of contracts. Long-Term Installment receivables, net were
$11.7 million and $11.3 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Rollins
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to insure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. The allowance balance is comprised of a general reserve, which is
determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance, and a specific reserve, which is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy
or other events, that make it unlikely that Rollins will recover its investment. The general reserve percentages are based on several factors, which include consideration of historical credit losses
and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio and information derived from competitive benchmarking.

respectively.

Total
depreciation expense was approximately $15.2 million in 2012, $15.1 million in 2011 and $16.0 million in 2010.

7.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable and other
short-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values. The
Company has financial instruments related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed in note 13.

The
fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant
non-observable inputs.

in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

At
December 31, 2012 the Deferred Compensation Plan had 41 life insurance policies with a net face value of $36.6 million. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies had a
net realizable value of $11.2 million and $9.8 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The total deferred
compensation plan assets, recorded in other assets on the Company's consolidated statements of financial position, were $11.3 million and $10.1 million at December 31, 2012 and
2011, respectively.

8.     GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill was $212.5 million as of
December 31, 2012 and $211.0 million as of December 31, 2011. Goodwill increased for the year ended December 31, 2012 due primarily to acquisitions. The carrying amount of
goodwill in foreign countries was $9.8 million as of December 31,



$9.6 million as of December 31, 2011. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 30, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:

9.     CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Customer contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio that current
revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350

"Intangibles—Goodwill and other",

the expected
lives of customer contracts were reviewed, and it was determined that customer contracts
should be amortized over a life of 8 to 20 years dependent upon customer type. The carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:

The
provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.0% on income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012. The effective rate differs from the annual federal
statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes.

For
2011 and 2010 the effective tax rate was 37.5% and 37.3%, respectively. The effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign
income taxes.

During
2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company paid income taxes of $63.0 million, $52.0 million and $60.1 million, respectively, net of refunds.



The
Company had state and federal income taxes receivable totaling $5.2 million and $6.3 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, included in other current assets.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes.

As
of December 31, 2012, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately $207.0 million, which will be available to offset
future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2013 and 2028. Management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $10.0 million of foreign
net operating losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance increased by
$0.5 million due to the foreign net operating losses.

Earnings
from continuing operations before income tax includes foreign income of $13.0 million in 2012, $11.0 million in 2011 and $7.8 million in 2010. During December 2009, the
international subsidiaries remitted their earnings to the Company in the form of a one-time dividend. In the future the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely the undistributed earnings
of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings is not practicable.



The
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $1.6 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending
amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The
Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. In many cases these uncertain tax positions are related to
tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. The federal tax audit for 2002 and 2003 was completed in 2011. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various
state jurisdictions that are currently under audit for years ranging from 1996 through 2008. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S.,
income tax examinations for years prior to 2006.

It
is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease in the next 12 months. These changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing state audits. It
is expected that certain state audits will be completed in the next 12 months resulting in a reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $0.9 million. None of the
reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements discussed above will affect the effective tax rate.

The
Company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $0.9 million and $1.0 million as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During 2012, 2011 and 2010 the Company recognized interest and penalties of $0.1 million, $0.3 million and $0.9 million,
respectively.

11.   ACCRUAL FOR TERMITE CONTRACTS

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450

"Contingencies,"

the Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the
estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include
termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

12.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases buildings, vehicles and equipment under operating and capital leases, some of which contain escalation clauses. The capital leases contractually expired at
various dates through 2011. The assets and liabilities acquired under capital leases are recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of future lease payments, and are depreciated
over the actual contract term. Depreciation of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense for 2012 and 2011. Following is a summary of property held under capital leases:

In
the normal course of business, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a
result of the rendering of services by the defendant subsidiary. The subsidiaries are actively contesting these actions. Some lawsuits have been filed (

John
Maciel v. Orkin, Inc., et al.; Douglas F. Bracho, Jr. v. Orkin, Inc.; Jennifer M. Welsh et al. v. Orkin, LLC, et al.:

and

Jennifer Thompson and Janet Flood v. Philadelphia Management Company, Parkway Associated, Parkway House Apartments, Barbara Williams, and Western
Pest Services

) in which the plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class. These cases originate in California (

Maciel
and Bracho

), South Carolina (

Welsh

), and Pennsylvania
(

Flood

), respectively. The

Maciel

lawsuit, a
wage and hour related matter, was filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California. The

Bracho

lawsuit, a
matter related to payroll deductions for use of Company vehicles, was filed in the Superior Court of Orange County, California. In

Bracho

, the Court in early October approved a final resolution
of this matter, and on October 15, 2012, it was
dismissed. The

Welsh

lawsuit, a termite service related matter, was filed in the Court of Common Pleas Fourteenth Judicial
Circuit, County of Beaufort, South Carolina. The

Flood

lawsuit, a bed bug service related matter filed by residents of an
apartment complex, was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. On October 26, 2012, the Court approved a settlement of the

Flood

case, and it was dismissed
with prejudice. None of the remaining matters have been scheduled for a class
certification hearing. Additionally, the Company and a subsidiary, The Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC, are named defendants in

Severn Peanut Co.
and Meherrin Agriculture & Chemical Co. v. Industrial Fumigant Co., et al

. The

Severn

lawsuit, a matter related to a fumigation service,



has
been filed in the Northern Division of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for breach of contract and negligence. The
Industrial Fumigant Company, LLC is also a named defendant in

Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania as Subrogee of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company,
Agrinational Insurance Company, Inc. as Subrogee of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company v. The Industrial Fumigant Co., The Industrial Fumigant
Company, LLC, and James Miller

. The

ADM

lawsuit, a matter related to a
fumigation service, has been filed in the State Court in Lucas County, Ohio. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for breach of contract and negligence. The Company believes these matters are without
merit and intends to vigorously contest certification and defend itself through trial or arbitration, if necessary. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation,
either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of
some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

is involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company's liability under any of these matters
would not and did not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Environmental remediation is reported on a non-discounted basis.

13.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Rollins, Inc.
Retirement Income Plan

The
Company maintains several noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans (the "Plans") covering employees meeting certain age and service requirements. The Plans provides
benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five years during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated Social
Security covered earnings. The Company funds the Plans with at least the minimum amount required by ERISA. The Company made contributions of $5.2 million, $4.9 million and
$5.2 million to the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

In
2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Retirement Income Plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June
2005. In 2012 the Plan was amended to allow certain vested terminated participants the ability to elect for a limited time the commencement of their benefit in the form of a single-sum payment, not to
exceed $13,500, or an annuity starting date of December 1, 2012. In total $4.7 million was paid by the Plan during the year ended December 31, 2012 under this program.

The
Company terminated the Waltham Services, LLC Salaried Pension Plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum in December 2012. The total payout by the plan was
either in the form of lump sum payments (including rollovers) or annuities. Active employees were eligible to roll their balances into the Rollins 401(k) Plan. The Annuities were purchased
through Principle. The total amount disbursed to terminate the plan totaled $4.0 million.

The
Company also includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan in the Company's financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with
FASB ASC Topic 715

"Compensation- Retirement Benefits"

, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of
the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes
adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.



In
June 2005, the Company froze the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit pension plan. The Company currently uses December 31 as the measurement date for its defined benefit
post-retirement plans. The funded status of the Plans and the net amount recognized in the statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans were $210.8 million and $196.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Accumulated benefit
obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the same for the Plans. Pre-tax increases in the pension liability which were (charged, net of tax) credited to other
comprehensive income/(loss) were $(15.4) million, $(24.5) million and $(1.9) million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The
return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in the plan. The expected
long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.

The
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, for fiscal year's 2012, 2011 and 2010 the
Company utilized a yield curve analysis.

The
Company does not expect to amortize a net gain or loss in 2013. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Plan's assets were comprised of listed common stocks and U.S. government and corporate
securities, real estate and other. Included in the assets of the Plan were shares of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock with a market value of $26.6 million and $34.1 million at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



The

For
each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical—maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk
in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. The investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. The plans utilize a number of
investment approaches, including individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. The
Company and management are considering making contributions to the pension plans of approximately $5.0 million during fiscal 2013.

Included
among the asset categories for the Plans' investments are real estate and other comprised of real estate and hedge funds. These investments are categorized as level 3 investments and
are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with ASU No. 2009-12
"

Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),"

these investments are valued based on the net asset
value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of
incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data
included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company's overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 70 percent of investments for long-term growth and
30 percent for near-term benefit payments, with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. Equity securities primarily include investments in
large-cap and mid-cap companies. Fixed-income securities include corporate bonds of companies in diversified securities, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Other
types of investments include hedge funds and private equity funds that follow several different investment strategies.

Some
of our assets, primarily our private equity, real estate and hedge funds, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the
underlying investments. For the December 31, 2011 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were
derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.



The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2012. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability
of the inputs used to determine fair value. See note 7 for a brief description of the three levels under the fair value hierarchy.

Defined Contribution 401(k) Plan

The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) Plan that is available to a majority of the Company's full-time employees the first of
the calendar quarter following completion of three months of service. The Plan is available to non full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one year of service
upon completion of 1,000 hours in that year. The Plan provides for a matching contribution of fifty cents ($.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions to the Plan that do
not exceed 6 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). The charge to expense for the Company match was approximately $7.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $7.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 approximately, 32.5%,
35.5% and 35.1%, respectively of the plan assets consisted of Rollins, Inc. Common Stock. Total administrative fees paid by the Company for the Plan were approximately $53 thousand in
2012, $42 thousand in 2011 and $52 thousand in 2010.



Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan

The Deferred Compensation Plan provides that participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual bonus with respect
to any given plan year, subject to a $2,000 per plan year minimum. The Company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts. The Company currently plans to credit accounts of
participants of long service to the Company with certain discretionary amounts ("Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions") in lieu of benefits that previously accrued under the Company's
Retirement Income Plan up to a maximum of $245,000. The Company intends to make Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan for five years. The first
contribution was made in January 2007 for those participants who were employed for all of the 2006 plan year. Only employees with five full years of vested service on June 30, 2005 qualify for
Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, salary and bonus deferrals and Pension Plan Benefit Restoration Contributions are fully vested. Any discretionary
contributions are subject to vesting in accordance with the matching contribution vesting schedule set forth in the Rollins 401(k) Plan in which a participant participates. The Company made its last
contributions associated with this plan during the first quarter of 2011.

Accounts
will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain "Measurement Funds." Account values are calculated as if the funds
from deferrals and Company credits had been converted into shares or other ownership units of selected Measurement Funds by purchasing (or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current
purchase price of the relevant Measurement Fund at the time of the participant's selection. Deferred Compensation Plan benefits are unsecured general obligations of the Company to the participants,
and these obligations rank in parity with the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company has established a "rabbi trust," which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to
indirectly fund any obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the extent that the Company's obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan exceed assets available under the trust, the
Company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Generally,
the Deferred Compensation Plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant's death, disability, retirement or other termination of
employment (a "Termination Event"). However, for any deferrals of salary and bonus (but not Company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a
Termination Event. Generally, the Deferred Compensation Plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan in installments or lump-sum
payments.

At
December 31, 2012 the Deferred Compensation Plan had 41 life insurance policies with a net face value of $36.6 million. The cash surrender value of these life insurance policies were
worth $11.2 million and $9.8 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

respectively, located within long-term accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated statements of financial position. The amounts of assets were marked to fair value.

14.   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock Compensation Plans

Stock options and time lapse restricted shares (TLRSs) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the Company's Employee Stock
Incentive Plan.

Stock Options

The Company's stock options generally vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date. For the year ended
December 31, 2012, the Company issued approximately 32 thousand shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees and issued 0.1 million shares in 2011.

In
order to estimate the fair value of stock options, the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options,
which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time.

Option
activity under the Company's stock option plan as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2012 were as follows:

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the year
and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on
that day. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company's stock.

The
aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $0.5 million, $1.7 million and $5.2 million, respectively.
Exercise of options during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 resulted in cash receipts of less than $1 thousand, $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.



Time Lapse Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units

TLRSs provide for the issuance of a share of the Company's Common Stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number
of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. The Company issued TLRSs that vest over ten years prior to 2004. TLRSs issued 2004 and later vest in 20 percent increments
starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. During these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares.
The agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

The
Company issued time lapse restricted shares of 0.8 million, 0.7 million and 0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The
Company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2012, approximately 4.5 million shares of the Company's common stock were reserved for
issuance. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, "

Compensation—Stock Compensation,

" the Company uses the modified prospective application
method of adoption, which requires the Company to record compensation cost, related to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of
these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December 31, 2005 are valued at fair value and recognized on
a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.
