Item 1. Business

Overview

     Cognizant  Technology  Solutions  Corporation  ("Cognizant",  "CTS"  or the
"Company") is a leading provider of custom IT design,  development,  integration
and  maintenance  services  primarily for Fortune 1000 companies  located in the
United States and Europe.  Cognizant's  core  competencies  include  web-centric
applications,  data  warehousing,  component-based  development  and  legacy and
client-server  systems.  Cognizant  provides  the IT services it offers using an
integrated  on-site/offshore  business  model.  This  seamless  on-site/offshore
business model combines  technical and account  management teams located on-site
at the customer location and offshore at dedicated  development  centers located
in India and Ireland.

     Cognizant  began its IT development and  maintenance  services  business in
early  1994,  as  an  in-house  technology  development  center  for  The  Dun &
Bradstreet  Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, Cognizant,  along with
certain other  entities,  was spun-off from the Dun & Bradstreet  Corporation to
form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, Cognizant completed
an initial public  offering of an Class A common stock (the "IPO").  On June 30,
1998, a majority interest in Cognizant, and certain other entities were spun-off
from  Cognizant  Corporation  to form IMS Health  Incorporated  ("IMS  Health").
Subsequently,   Cognizant   Corporation  was  renamed  Nielsen  Media  Research,
Incorporated.  At December 31, 2002,  IMS Health owned 55.3% of the  outstanding
stock of Cognizant  (representing  all of Cognizant's  Class B common stock) and
held 92.5% of the combined voting power of Cognizant's common stock.  Holders of
Cognizant's  Class A  common  stock  have  one vote per  share  and  holders  of
Cognizant's Class B common stock had ten votes per share.

     On February 11, 2000, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split
effected by a 100% dividend  payable on March 16, 2000 to stockholders of record
on March 2,  2000.  The  stock  split  has been  reflected  in the  accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements,  and all  applicable  references  as to the
number  of  common  shares  and  per  share   information  have  been  restated.
Appropriate  adjustments  have been made in the  exercise  and  number of shares
subject to stock  options.  Stockholder  equity  accounts  have been restated to
reflect the reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase
in issued  common  shares  from the  additional  paid-in-capital  account to the
common stock accounts.

     On May 23, 2000, the  stockholders  of the Company  approved an increase in
the  number  of  authorized  Class B common  stock  from  15,000,000  shares  to
25,000,000 shares.

     On January 30, 2003,  the Company  filed a tender offer in which IMS Health
stockholders could exchange IMS Health shares held by them for Cognizant Class B
common stock held by IMS Health.

     On February 13, 2003, IMS Health  distributed  all of the Cognizant Class B
common stock that IMS Health owned (a total of 11,290,900 shares) in an exchange
offer to its  stockholders.  IMS Health  distributed  0.309  shares of Cognizant
Class B common stock to its




stockholders  for every one share of IMS Health's common stock  tendered.  There
was no impact on the number of  Cognizant's  total shares  outstanding  upon the
completion of the exchange offer.

     As of February 21, 2003,  pursuant to Cognizant's  Restated  Certificate of
Incorporation, all of the shares of Class B common stock automatically converted
into  shares  of  Class  A  common  stock.  According  to  Cognizant's  Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, if at any time the outstanding shares of Cognizant
Class B common stock ceased to represent at least 35% of the economic  ownership
represented  by the  aggregate  number of shares of Cognizant  common stock then
outstanding,  each share of Cognizant  Class B common stock shall  automatically
convert  into  one  share of Class A common  stock.  This  automatic  conversion
occurred on February 21, 2003 based on share numbers  received by Cognizant from
its transfer agent  (American  Stock Transfer and Trust Company) as of the close
of business  February 20, 2003,  which  indicated  that the Class B common stock
represented  less than 35%  ownership  represented  by the  aggregate  number of
shares of Cognizant common stock then outstanding.  Accordingly,  as of February
21, 2003, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding.

     On March 5, 2003,  the Board of  Directors  declared a 3-for-1  stock split
effected by a 200% stock dividend  payable on April 1, 2003 to  stockholders  of
record on March 19, 2003. Pro forma unaudited  earnings per share  reflective of
the stock split have been  presented in  Cognizant's  Consolidated  Statement of
Operations.  The  historical  share and per share  amounts  in the  consolidated
financial  statements have not been restated to reflect the 3-for-1 stock split.
Such amounts will be restated on the effective date of the stock dividend.

     The  Company  provides  the IT  services  it  offers  using  an  integrated
on-site/offshore  business model. This seamless  on-site/offshore business model
combines  technical and account management teams located on-site at the customer
location  and  offshore at dedicated  development  centers  located in India and
Ireland.  The  Company  markets  and sells its  technology  consulting  services
directly through its professional  staff, senior management and sales personnel.
The  Company  operates  out of its  Teaneck,  New  Jersey  headquarters  and its
regional and international offices. The number of customers for whom the Company
has provided  services  has grown from 90 customers in 2000 to 100  customers in
2001; and to 115 customers in 2002. The Company's customers include:

 ACNielsen Corporation                   First Data Corporation
 ADP, Incorporated                       IMS Health Incorporated ("IMS Health")
 Brinker International, Incorporated     Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
 CCC Information Services Incorporated   Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated
 Computer Sciences Corporation           PNC Bank
 The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation        Royal & SunAlliance USA





ACQUISITIONS

     On June 30,  2002,  the  Company  acquired  the assets of  UnitedHealthcare
Ireland Limited  ("UHCI"),  a subsidiary of UnitedHealth  Group. UHCI previously
provided,  and will continue to provide through Cognizant  Technology  Solutions
Ireland  Limited  ("CTS  Ireland"),   application  development  and  maintenance
services,  using the existing staff of approximately 70 software  professionals.
This  acquisition  is  designed to enable the Company to provide a wide range of
services to the Company's  clients in Europe and worldwide  and  represents  the
initial  implementation  of the  Company's  previously  announced  international
expansion strategy.

     Additionally,  on October 29, 2002,  the Company  completed the transfer of
Silverline  Technologies,  Inc.'s  practice,  which  serviced a major  financial
services  company to the Company.  Under the terms of the transfer,  the Company
will provide  application design,  development and maintenance  services to such
major financial  services company through an acquired workforce of approximately
three  hundred IT and  support  professionals  located  primarily  in the United
States and India.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

     Many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing
market   dynamics.   In  addition,   the   evolution  of   technology   and  the
commercialization  of the Internet have  contributed  to the rapid change in the
business  environment.  In  response to these  challenges,  many  companies  are
focused on improving productivity, increasing service levels, lowering costs and
accelerating  delivery  times.  In order to achieve  these goals,  companies are
implementing a broad range of technologies, such as,

     o    e-business and e-commerce applications;

     o    data warehousing;

     o    customer and supply chain management; and

     o    middleware/enterprise application integration.

     These technologies facilitate faster, more responsive,  lower-cost business
operations.  However,  their development,  integration and on-going  maintenance
present  major   challenges  and  require  a  large  number  of  highly  skilled
professionals trained in many diverse technologies.  In addition, companies also
require  additional  technical  resources to maintain,  enhance and  re-engineer
their core legacy IT systems and to address  application  maintenance  projects.
Increasingly,  companies are relying on custom IT solutions  providers,  such as
Cognizant, to provide these services.

     In order to respond  effectively  to a changing  and  challenging  business
environment,  IT  departments of many  companies  have focused  increasingly  on
improving  returns  on IT  investments,  lowering  costs  and  accelerating  the
delivery of new systems and solutions.  To accomplish these objectives,  many IT
departments have shifted all or a portion of their IT



development,   integration  and  maintenance  requirements  to  outside  service
providers.  This outsourcing  enables companies to eliminate or reduce the large
in-house IT staffs  otherwise  required  to  evaluate,  implement  and manage IT
initiatives,  thereby  reducing the present and future  investments  required to
maintain and  continually  train a technical  staff. In order to achieve greater
cost savings and to increase delivery times,  companies are increasingly turning
to IT services providers operating with on-site/offshore business models.

     Global  demand  for high  quality,  lower  cost IT  services  from  outside
providers has created a significant  opportunity for IT service  providers which
can successfully  leverage the benefits of, and address the challenges in using,
an offshore  talent pool.  The effective  use of offshore  personnel can offer a
variety of benefits,  including lower costs, faster delivery of new IT solutions
and more flexible scheduling. Certain developing countries,  particularly India,
have a large talent pool of highly qualified  technical  professionals  that can
provide  high  quality  IT  services  at a lower  cost.  India is a leader in IT
services and is regarded as having one of the largest  pools of IT talent in the
world.  Historically,  IT  service  providers  have used  offshore  labor  pools
primarily to  supplement  the internal  staffing  needs of  customers.  However,
evolving  customer  demands  have led to the  increasing  acceptance  and use of
offshore  resources for higher  value-added  services.  These  services  include
application design, development,  integration and maintenance.  India's services
and  software  exports  have grown from $5.2  billion  for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2001 to $6.0  billion for the fiscal  year ended  March 31,  2002,  as
estimated  by the  National  Association  of  Software  and  Services  Companies
(NASSCOM)  in India  (converted  from rupees to U.S.  dollars at the  respective
year-end noon-buying rates announced by the New York Federal Reserve Bank). This
represents a 15% growth over the prior  period.  NASSCOM has  projected  India's
services and software exports to grow at a rate of approximately  22% for fiscal
year 2002-03.

     Using an offshore  workforce  to provide  value-added  services  presents a
number of challenges to IT service  providers.  The offshore  implementation  of
value-added  IT services  requires  that IT service  providers  continually  and
effectively  attract,  train and  retain  highly  skilled  software  development
professionals  with the advanced  technical  skills  necessary to keep pace with
continuing  changes in information  technology,  evolving industry standards and
changing customer preferences. These skills are necessary to design, develop and
deploy high-quality  technology solutions in a cost-effective and timely manner.
In addition,  IT service  providers must have the  methodologies,  processes and
communications  capabilities  to enable  offshore  workforces to be successfully
integrated  with  on-site  personnel.  Service  providers  must also have strong
research  and  development  capabilities,   technology  competency  centers  and
relationship management skills in order to compete effectively.

THE COGNIZANT SOLUTION

     Cognizant   believes  that  it  has   developed  an  effective   integrated
on-site/offshore business model, and that this business model will be a critical
element of Cognizant's  continued  growth.  To support this business  model,  at
December 31, 2002,  Cognizant  employed over 3,900 programmers in India and over
5,400  globally.  Cognizant  has also  established  facilities,  technology  and
communications  infrastructure in order to support its business model. By basing
certain technical  operations in India,  Cognizant has access to a large pool of
skilled, English-speaking IT professionals.  These IT professionals provide high
quality services to Cognizant's




customers at costs  significantly  lower than services  sourced  exclusively  in
developed   countries.   Cognizant's   strengths,   which   Cognizant   believes
differentiate it from other IT service providers, include the following:

     ESTABLISHED  AND SCALABLE  PROPRIETARY  PROCESSES.  Cognizant has developed
proprietary   methodologies  for  integrating  on-site  and  offshore  teams  to
facilitate  cost-effective,  on-time  delivery of high-quality  projects.  These
methodologies  comprise  Cognizant's  proprietary  Q*VIEW  software  engineering
process,  which is available to all on-site and offshore programmers.  Cognizant
uses this ISO 9000 certified  process to define and implement  projects from the
design,  development  and  deployment  stages  through to  on-going  application
maintenance.  For most projects, Q*VIEW is used as part of an initial assessment
that allows Cognizant to define the scope and risks of the project and subdivide
the project into smaller  phases with  frequent  deliverables  and feedback from
customers.  Cognizant  also uses its  Q*VIEW  process to  detect,  mitigate  and
correct possible quality defects and to establish appropriate  contingencies for
each  project.  In  order  to  ensure  implementation  of the  quality  process,
Cognizant  assigns  a quality  facilitator  to each  project  who  reports  to a
centralized  quality  assurance  and  software  engineering  group.  This  group
performs, on a sample basis, quality audits, deliverables verifications, metrics
collection and analysis,  which are used to improve processes and methodologies.
These processes and methodologies  have proven to be scalable,  as Cognizant has
significantly  increased the number of offshore development  centers,  customers
and projects. In addition, all of Cognizant's principal development centers have
been assessed by KPMG at Level 5 (the highest possible rating) of the Capability
Maturity  Model  of  the  Software  Engineering  Institute  at  Carnegie  Mellon
University,  which is a widely  recognized  means of  measuring  the quality and
maturity of an organization's software development and maintenance processes.

     HIGHLY  SKILLED  WORKFORCE.   Cognizant's  managers  and  senior  technical
personnel  provide  in-depth  project  management  expertise  to  customers.  To
maintain this level of expertise,  Cognizant has placed significant  emphasis on
recruiting and training its workforce of highly skilled professionals. Cognizant
has over 350 project managers and senior  technical  personnel around the world,
many of whom have  significant  work experience in the United States and Europe.
Cognizant  also  maintains  programs  and  personnel  to hire and train the best
available   technical   professionals   in  both  legacy  systems  and  emerging
technologies.   Cognizant   provides  five  months  of  combined  classroom  and
on-the-job  training to newly hired  programmers,  as well as additional  annual
training programs designed to enhance the business practices,  tools, technology
and consulting skills of Cognizant's  professional staff. Cognizant was recently
assessed  at Level 5 (the  highest  possible  rating) of the  People  Capability
Maturity Model (P-CMM) version 2.0.

     RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT  AND  COMPETENCY  CENTERS.  Cognizant has project
experience and expertise across multiple  architectures  and  technologies,  and
makes  significant  investments  in its  competency  centers and in research and
development  to keep  abreast of the  latest  technology  developments.  Most of
Cognizant's  programmers are trained in multiple technologies and architectures.
As a  result,  Cognizant  is able to  react  to  customers'  needs  quickly  and
efficiently redeploy programmers to different technologies.  In order to develop
and maintain this  flexibility,  Cognizant has made a substantial  investment in
its competency centers where the




experience gained from particular  projects and research and development efforts
is leveraged across the entire company.  In addition,  through its investment in
research  and  development  activities  and  the  continuing  education  of  its
technical  personnel,  Cognizant  enlarges its  knowledge  base and develops the
necessary  skills to keep pace with emerging  technologies.  Cognizant  believes
that its  ability  to work in new  technologies  allows it to  foster  long-term
relationships  by having the capacity to  continually  address the needs of both
existing and new customers.

     WELL-DEVELOPED INFRASTRUCTURE. Cognizant's extensive facilities, technology
and  communications  infrastructure  facilitate the seamless  integration of its
on-site and offshore workforces. This is accomplished by permitting team members
in different locations to access common project information and to work directly
on customer projects. This infrastructure allows for:

          o    rapid completion of projects;

          o    highest level of quality;

          o    off-peak use of customers' technological resources; and

          o    real-time  access to project  information by the on-site  account
               manager or the customer.

     International time differences enable Cognizant's offshore teams located in
India to access a customer's  computing  facilities located in the United States
and Europe  during  off-peak  hours.  This  ability to perform  services  during
off-peak hours enables  Cognizant to complete projects more rapidly and does not
require Cognizant's customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software. In
addition,  for large  projects  with short  time  frames,  Cognizant's  offshore
facilities  allow for  parallel  processing  of  various  development  phases to
accelerate  delivery  time.  In addition,  Cognizant  can deliver  services more
rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because Cognizant's
lower labor costs enable it to  cost-effectively  assign more professionals to a
project.

BUSINESS STRATEGIES

     Cognizant's  objectives  are to  maximize  stockholder  value  and  enhance
Cognizant's  position as a leading  provider  of custom IT design,  development,
integration and maintenance  services.  Cognizant  implements the following core
strategies to achieve these objectives:

     FURTHER  DEVELOP  LONG-TERM  CUSTOMER  RELATIONSHIPS.  Cognizant has strong
long-term  strategic  relationships  with its customers  and business  partners.
Cognizant  seeks to establish  long-term  relationships  that present  recurring
revenue  opportunities,  frequently trying to establish  relationships  with its
customers' chief information  officers, or other IT decision makers, by offering
a wide array of cost-effective  high quality  services.  Over 80% of Cognizant's
revenues in the year ended December 31, 2002 were derived from customers who had
been using  Cognizant's  services for one year or more.  Cognizant also seeks to
leverage  its  experience  with  a  customer's  IT  systems  into  new  business
opportunities. Knowledge of a customer's IT systems



gained during the performance of application  maintenance services, for example,
may provide  Cognizant  with a  competitive  advantage  in  securing  additional
development and maintenance projects from that customer.

     EXPAND  SERVICE  OFFERINGS  AND  SOLUTIONS.  Cognizant  has  several  teams
dedicated to developing new, high value services.  These teams  collaborate with
customers  to develop  these  services.  For  example,  Cognizant  is  currently
developing new solutions for IT systems portfolio analysis,  program management,
technology  architecture and strategy,  systems testing,  legacy restoration and
digital  security  and  forensics.  In addition,  Cognizant  invests in internal
research and development and promotes  knowledge building and sharing across the
organization  in order to promote the  development of new services and solutions
that it can offer to customers. Furthermore,  Cognizant continues to enhance its
capabilities  and  service  offerings  in the  areas  of  Customer  Relationship
Management, or CRM, and Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP. Cognizant believes
that the continued  expansion of its service  offerings will reduce its reliance
on any one technology  initiative and will help foster  long-term  relationships
with customers by allowing Cognizant to serve the needs of its customers better.

     ENHANCE PROCESSES,  METHODOLOGIES AND PRODUCTIVITY  TOOLSETS.  Cognizant is
committed to improving and enhancing its proprietary Q*VIEW software engineering
process and other methodologies and toolsets. In light of the rapid evolution of
technology,  Cognizant  believes  that  continued  investment  in  research  and
development  is critical  to its  continued  success.  Cognizant  is  constantly
designing and  developing  additional  productivity  software  tools to automate
testing processes and improve project estimation and risk assessment techniques.
In addition, Cognizant uses groupware technology to share project experience and
best  practice  methodologies  across the  organization  with the  objective  of
improving productivity.

     EXPAND DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE. As Cognizant expands
its customer base, it plans to open  additional  sales and marketing  offices in
the United States and  internationally.  It is expected that this expansion will
facilitate  sales and  service to  existing  and new  customers.  Cognizant  has
established   sales  and  marketing   offices  in  Atlanta,   Chicago,   Dallas,
Minneapolis, Los Angeles, San Francisco and in Teaneck, New Jersey. In addition,
Cognizant has been pursuing  market  opportunities  in Europe through its London
office,  which  was  established  in the  beginning  of 1998,  and its  recently
acquired development center in Limerick, Ireland.

     PURSUE  SELECTIVE  STRATEGIC  ACQUISITIONS,  JOINT  VENTURES AND  STRATEGIC
ALLIANCES.  Cognizant  believes that  opportunities  exist in the  fragmented IT
services market to expand its business through selective strategic acquisitions,
joint ventures and strategic alliances.  Cognizant believes that acquisition and
joint venture candidates may enable it to expand its geographic presence and its
capabilities  more  rapidly,  especially  in the  European  market,  as  well as
accelerate  its entry into areas of new  technology.  In  addition,  through its
working  relationships  with  independent  software  vendors  Cognizant  obtains
projects  using  the  detailed  knowledge  it gains in  connection  with a joint
development process.  Finally,  Cognizant will strategically partner with select
IT service  firms that offer  complementary  services  in order to best meet the
requirements of its customers.



SERVICES

     Cognizant provides a broad range of IT services, including:


Service                            Summary Description of Service Offerings
- --------                           ----------------------------------------

Application Design, Development,   Define customer requirements, write
Integration and Re-engineering     specifications and design, develop, test and
                                   integrate software across multiple platforms
                                   including Internet technologies.  Modify and
                                   test applications to enable systems to
                                   function in new operating environments.

Application Maintenance             Support some or all of a customer's
                                    applications ensuring that systems remain
                                    operational and responsive to changing user
                                    requirements, and to provide on-going
                                    enhancement as required by the customer.

     Cognizant uses its Q*VIEW  software  engineering  process,  its on-site and
offshore  business  model  and  well-developed   technology  and  communications
infrastructure to deliver these services.

     APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION AND RE-ENGINEERING SERVICES. Cognizant
follows  either of two  alternative  approaches to application  development  and
integration:

          o    full  life-cycle  application  development,  in  which  Cognizant
               assumes  start-to-finish  responsibility  for  analysis,  design,
               implementation, testing and integration of systems; or

          o    cooperative development, in which Cognizant employees work with a
               customer's  in- house IT  personnel to jointly  analyze,  design,
               implement, test and integrate new systems.

     In both cases,  Cognizant's  on-site  team  members  work  closely with the
end-users of the application to define requirements and develop  specifications.
Detailed design,  implementation and testing are generally performed offshore at
Cognizant's ten IT development centers located in India, as well its development
center in  Limerick,  Ireland.  In  addition,  Cognizant  maintains  an  on-site
presence at each customer  location in order to address evolving  customer needs
and resulting changes to the project.

     A key part of Cognizant's  application development and integration offering
is a suite of  services  to help  organizations  build  and  integrate  business
applications  with the  rest of their  operations.  In this  suite of  services,
Cognizant  leverages  its  skills  in  business   application   development  and
enterprise application  integration to build sophisticated business applications
and to integrate  these new  applications  and websites  with client  server and
legacy systems.  Cognizant  builds and deploys  robust,  scalable and extensible
architectures  for  use in a  wide  range  of  industries.  Cognizant  maintains
competency centers specializing in Microsoft, IBM and




Sun, among others,  in order to be able to provide  application  development and
integration services to a broad spectrum of customers.

     Cognizant's  re-engineering  service  offerings assist customers  migrating
from systems based on legacy computing environments to newer, open systems-based
platforms  and  client/server  architectures,  often  in  response  to the  more
stringent demands of business. Cognizant's re-engineering tools automate many of
the  processes  required  to  implement  advanced  client/server   technologies.
Cognizant believes that this automation  substantially reduces the time and cost
to perform re-engineering services,  savings that benefit both Cognizant and its
customers. These tools also enable Cognizant to perform source code analysis and
to re-design  target  databases and convert certain  programming  languages.  If
necessary,  Cognizant's  programmers  also help customers  re-design and convert
user interfaces.

     APPLICATION  MAINTENANCE  SERVICES.  Cognizant  provides  services  to help
ensure  that a  customer's  core  operational  systems  are free of defects  and
responsive to the customer's changing needs. As part of this process,  Cognizant
is often able to introduce product and process  enhancements and improve service
levels to customers requesting modifications and on-going support.

     Cognizant's  on-site/offshore business model enables Cognizant to provide a
range of rapid response and  cost-effective  support  services to its customers.
Cognizant's  on-site  team  members  often  provide  help-desk  services  at the
customer's  facility.  These team members typically carry pagers in the event of
an  emergency  service  request and are  available to quickly  resolve  customer
problems  from  remote  locations.  In the  case  of  more  complex  maintenance
services,  including  modifications,   enhancements  and  documentation,   which
typically have longer  turnaround  times,  Cognizant takes full advantage of its
offshore  resources to develop  solutions  more  cost-effectively  than would be
possible relying on higher cost local  professionals.  The services  provided by
Cognizant's offshore team members are delivered to customers using satellite and
fiber-optic telecommunications.

     As  part  of  Cognizant's  application  maintenance  services,  it  assists
customers in renovating their core systems to meet the  requirements  imposed by
new regulations, new standards or other external events. These services include,
or have previously  included,  Year 2000  compliance,  Eurocurrency  compliance,
decimalization  within the securities  industry and  compliance  with the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for the healthcare industry.

     Application  maintenance  service contracts are usually long term in nature
and, at times, can include an element of application  development (See Note 2 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements).

     Cognizant seeks to anticipate the operational  environment of customer's IT
systems  as  it  designs  and  develops  such  systems.  Cognizant  also  offers
diagnostic  services to customers to assist them in identifying  shortcomings in
their IT systems and optimizing the performance of their systems.





SALES AND MARKETING

     Cognizant  markets and sells its services directly through its professional
staff,  senior  management  and  direct  sales  personnel  operating  out of its
Teaneck,  New  Jersey  headquarters  and its  business  development  offices  in
Atlanta,  Chicago, Dallas,  Minneapolis,  Los Angeles, San Francisco and London.
Cognizant  manages its business and results of operations on a geographic basis.
At December 31, 2002, Cognizant had approximately 21 direct sales persons and 68
account managers. The sales and marketing group works with Cognizant's technical
team as the sales  process  moves  closer to the  customer's  selection of an IT
service provider. The duration of the sales process varies depending on the type
of service,  ranging from approximately two months to over one year. The account
manager or sales executive works with the technical team to:

          o    define  the  scope,   deliverables,   assumptions  and  execution
               strategies for a proposed project;

          o    develop project estimates;

          o    prepare pricing and margin analyses; and

          o    finalize sales proposals.

     Management reviews and approves proposals,  which are then presented to the
prospective  customer.  Cognizant sales and account management  personnel remain
actively involved in the project through the execution phase.  Cognizant focuses
its marketing efforts on businesses with intensive information processing needs.
Cognizant  maintains a prospect/customer  database that is continuously  updated
and used throughout the sales cycle from prospect  qualification  to close. As a
result of this marketing system,  Cognizant  pre-qualifies sales  opportunities,
and direct sales representatives are able to minimize the time spent on prospect
qualification. In addition, substantial emphasis is placed on customer retention
and  expansion  of  services  provided to existing  customers.  In this  regard,
Cognizant's  account  managers  play an important  marketing  role by leveraging
their ongoing relationship with the customer to identify opportunities to expand
and diversify the type of services provided to that customer.

CUSTOMERS

     The number of customers served by Cognizant has increased  significantly in
recent years. Cognizant provided services to 90 customers in 2000; 100 customers
in 2001; and 115 customers in 2002.

     For the year ended December 31, 2002,  Cognizant  derived its revenues from
the  following  industries:  34%  from  financial  related  services,  24%  from
healthcare services,  17% from retail,  manufacturing and logistics and 14% from
information  services.  The  remaining  portions of  Cognizant's  revenues  were
derived from strategic alliances and other sources.



Cognizant dedicates a number of its employees to each of the major industries it
services to better serve its customers.

     Cognizant provides services either on a  time-and-material  basis or on the
basis of an  agreed  fixed  bid.  The  volume  of work  performed  for  specific
customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a significant customer in one
year may not use Cognizant's services in a subsequent year.

         Presented in the table below is additional information about
Cognizant's customers.

COMPETITION

     The intensely  competitive  IT services  market  includes a large number of
participants and is subject to rapid change.  This market includes  participants
from a variety of market segments, including:

          o    systems integration firms;

          o    contract programming companies;

          o    application software companies;

          o    Internet solutions providers;

          o    the professional services groups of computer equipment companies;
               and

          o    facilities management and outsourcing companies.

     Cognizant's most direct competitors  include,  among others, WIPRO Ltd. and
Infosys  Technologies  Limited,  which  utilize an  integrated  on-site/offshore
business  model  comparable to that used by Cognizant.  Cognizant  also competes
with large IT service providers with greater resources,  such as Accenture Ltd.,
Electronic Data Systems Corporation and IBM Global Services,  who have announced
their  intentions  to develop  more  offshore  capabilities  to lower





their cost  structure.  In addition,  Cognizant  competes with numerous  smaller
local companies in the various geographic markets in which Cognizant operates.

     Many of  Cognizant's  competitors  have  significantly  greater  financial,
technical  and  marketing  resources  and  greater  name  recognition  than does
Cognizant.   The  principal   competitive  factors  affecting  the  markets  for
Cognizant's services include:

          o    performance and reliability;

          o    quality of technical support, training and services;

          o    responsiveness to customer needs;

          o    reputation, experience and financial stability; and

          o    competitive pricing of services.

          Cognizant relies on the following to compete effectively:

          o    a well developed recruiting, training and retention model;

          o    a successful service delivery model;

          o    a broad referral base;

          o    continual   investment  in  process   improvement  and  knowledge
               capture;

          o    investment in research and development;

          o    continued focus on responsiveness  to customer needs,  quality of
               services, competitive; and

          o    prices, project management capabilities and technical expertise.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     Cognizant's  intellectual  property  rights are  important to its business.
Cognizant  presently  holds  no  patents  or  registered  copyrights.   Instead,
Cognizant relies on a combination of intellectual  property laws, trade secrets,
confidentiality   procedures   and   contractual   provisions   to  protect  its
intellectual   property.   Cognizant   requires   its   employees,   independent
contractors,  vendors  and  customers  to  enter  into  written  confidentiality
agreements upon the commencement of their  relationships  with Cognizant.  These
agreements  generally  provide that any confidential or proprietary  information
developed by Cognizant or on its behalf be kept confidential.  In addition, when
Cognizant  discloses  any  confidential  or  proprietary  information  to  third
parties,  it routinely  requires those third parties to agree in writing to keep
that information confidential.



     A portion of Cognizant's business involves the development for customers of
highly complex information technology software applications and other technology
deliverables.  This intellectual  property includes written  specifications  and
documentation  in connection  with specific  customer  engagements.  Cognizant's
customers  usually  own the  intellectual  property  in the  software  Cognizant
develops for them.

     Pursuant  to a  license  agreement  with  IMS  Health,  all  rights  to the
"Cognizant" name and certain related trade and service marks were transferred to
Cognizant in July 1998. As of December 31, 2002, Cognizant held three registered
trademarks  in the United  States and four  pending  trademark  applications  in
India.

EMPLOYEES

     At December 31, 2002,  Cognizant employed  approximately 1,425 persons on a
full-time  basis in its North American  headquarters  and satellite  offices and
on-site North American customer locations. Cognizant also employed approximately
240 persons on a full-time basis in its European  satellite  offices and on-site
European customer locations,  principally in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and
approximately  4,500 persons on a full-time basis in its offshore IT development
centers in India.  None of  Cognizant's  employees  are subject to a  collective
bargaining arrangement.  Cognizant considers its relations with its employees to
be good.

     Cognizant's  future success depends to a significant  extent on its ability
to attract,  train and retain highly  skilled IT development  professionals.  In
particular,  Cognizant  needs to  attract,  train and retain  project  managers,
programmers and other senior technical personnel.  Cognizant believes there is a
shortage of, and significant  competition  for, IT development  professionals in
the United States and in India with the advanced  technological skills necessary
to perform the services  Cognizant offers.  Cognizant has an active  recruitment
program in India,  and has  developed  a  recruiting  system and  database  that
facilitates the rapid identification of skilled candidates. During the course of
the year,  Cognizant conducts  extensive  recruiting efforts at premier colleges
and technical schools in India. Cognizant evaluates candidates based on academic
performance,  the results of a written  aptitude test measuring  problem-solving
skills and a technical interview.  In addition,  Cognizant has an active lateral
recruiting  program.  A  substantial  majority of the  personnel on most on-site
teams and virtually all the personnel  staffed on offshore teams is comprised of
Indian nationals.

     Cognizant's senior project managers are hired from leading consulting firms
in the United States and India.  Cognizant's  senior  management and most of its
project managers have experience  working in the United States and Europe.  This
enhances  Cognizant's  ability to attract and retain  other  professionals  with
experience  in the  United  States.  Cognizant  has also  adopted  a career  and
education  management  program to define its  employees'  objectives  and career
plans.  Cognizant has implemented an intensive  orientation and training program
to  introduce  new  employees  to the Q*VIEW  software  engineering  process and
Cognizant's services.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     Cognizant  has  recently   completed   construction   of  two   fully-owned
state-of-the-art  development  centers containing  approximately  250,000 square
feet  of  space  in  the  Indian  cities  of  Calcutta  and  Pune,  and  expects
construction of a third  state-of-the-art  development center in Chennai,  India
containing  approximately  370,000 square feet to be completed in 2003.  Each of
these development centers will contain up-to-date technology  infrastructure and
communications capabilities.  These three facilities will be able to accommodate
approximately  6,000  employees  in total.  Cognizant  believes  that  these new
facilities will provide  Cognizant with an advantage in recruiting new employees
and in retaining customers.

     Cognizant  operates out of its  Teaneck,  New Jersey  headquarters  and its
regional  and  international  offices.   Cognizant  believes  that  its  current
facilities  are  adequate to support its  existing  operations.  Cognizant  also
believes  that  it will be able to  obtain  suitable  additional  facilities  on
commercially reasonable terms on an "as needed" basis.

     The Company occupies the following properties:














ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions  arising in the
ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management,  the outcome of such
claims  and legal  actions,  if decided  adversely,  is not  expected  to have a
material adverse effect on its quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows
or consolidated financial position.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTER TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, on January 7, 2003,  the Board of
Directors,  and IMS Health,  the holder on such date of approximately 55% of the
Company's  outstanding common stock and approximately 93% of the combined voting
power of the Company's outstanding common stock, by written consent in lieu of a
special  stockholders  meeting,   approved  the  amendment  and  restatement  of
Cognizant's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  As of January 7,
2003, 9,129,438 shares of Cognizant's Class A common stock and 11,290,900 shares
of Cognizant's  Class B common stock were issued and outstanding.  Each share of
Cognizant's  Class A common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter
submitted to the stockholders and each share of Cognizant's Class B common stock
entitled its holder to ten votes on each matter  submitted to the  stockholders.
Because  IMS Health,  which held in excess of a majority of the voting  power of
Cognizant's  outstanding common stock as of the date of such stockholder action,
approved  the  foregoing   amendment  and  restatement  of  the  certificate  of
incorporation by written consent,  no other stockholder  consents were solicited
in connection  with the  stockholder  action.  In compliance  with Delaware law,
notice of such stockholder action was sent to all non-consenting stockholders on
January  17,  2003.  The  material  terms of the  amendments  to the Amended and
Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  are  summarized  in Item 5 below.  For
complete information, you should read the full text of the




Restated  Certificate of Incorporation,  which has been filed with the SEC as an
exhibit to the Company's Current Report of Form 8-K dated February 13, 2003. The
Restated  Certificate of  Incorporation  is  incorporated by reference into this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. The approved amendments were effected on February 7,
2003 upon the  filing of the  Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.




                                     PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

     Prior to June 1998, there was no established market for the Company's Class
B common stock.  Since June 19, 1998, the Class A common stock has traded on the
Nasdaq National Market ("NNM") under the symbol "CTSH". Cognizant Class B common
stock is not listed on a stock exchange and does not trade.

     Prior to February 13,  2003,  all of the issued and  outstanding  shares of
Class B common stock were held by IMS Health.  On February 13, 2003,  IMS Health
distributed  all of the Cognizant  Class B common stock that IMS Health owned (a
total of 11,290,900 shares) in an exchange offer to its stockholders. IMS Health
distributed  0.309 shares of Cognizant Class B common stock to its  stockholders
for every one share of IMS Health's  common stock  tendered.  As of February 21,
2003, pursuant to Cognizant's Restated Certificate of Incorporation,  all of the
shares of Class B common stock  automatically  converted  into shares of Class A
common stock. According to Cognizant's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if
at any time the  outstanding  shares of Cognizant Class B common stock ceased to
represent at least 35% of the economic  ownership  represented  by the aggregate
number of shares of  Cognizant  common  stock  then  outstanding,  each share of
Cognizant  Class B common  stock shall  automatically  convert into one share of
Class A common stock.  This automatic  conversion  occurred on February 21, 2003
based on share numbers  received by Cognizant from its transfer agent  (American
Stock Transfer and Trust Company) as of the close of business February 20, 2003,
which  indicated  that  the  Class B  common  stock  represented  less  than 35%
ownership  represented  by the  aggregate  number of shares of Cognizant  common
stock then  outstanding.  Accordingly,  as of February  21,  2003,  there are no
shares of Class B common stock outstanding.

     The  following  table  describes  the per share  range of high and low sale
prices for shares of Cognizant  Class A common stock, as listed for quotation on
the NNM, and the quarterly cash dividends per share for the periods indicated.

     As of March 3,  2003,  the  approximate  number of holders of record of the
Class A common stock was 28 and the approximate  number of beneficial holders of
the Class A common stock was 29,950.




     The Company has never  declared  or paid cash  dividends  on its Class A or
Class B common  stock.  The  Company  currently  intends  to retain  any  future
earnings  to  finance  the  growth  of the  business  and,  therefore,  does not
currently anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

AMENDMENTS TO COGNIZANT'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     In  connection  with the  exchange  offer,  IMS  Health  executed a written
consent  in lieu of a special  stockholders  meeting to  approve  amendments  to
Cognizant's  certificate of incorporation that included the provisions described
below and became  effective  following  consummation of the exchange offer.  The
material  terms  of  these   amendments  are  summarized   below.  For  complete
information,  you  should  read the full  text of the  Restated  Certificate  of
Incorporation,  which has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the Company's
Current Report of Form 8-K dated February 13, 2003. The Restated  Certificate of
Incorporation is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

EFFECTS OF THE AMENDMENTS

     The  exchange  offer  may make it  easier  for a single  person or group of
related  persons  to gain  control  over  Cognizant.  Because  IMS  Health  held
approximately  55%  of  Cognizant's   outstanding  common  stock,   constituting
approximately  93% of the combined voting power of Cognizant's  common stock, it
was  impossible  for a person other than IMS Health to gain control of Cognizant
without IMS Health's  consent.  Following the exchange offer,  however,  the new
holders of Cognizant's common stock have the ability to elect Cognizant's entire
Board of Directors. Accordingly, a person or group of related persons could gain
control of Cognizant by acquiring a majority of the outstanding common stock, or
the votes  represented by those shares.  In addition,  the control position that
IMS Health had in matters voted on by Cognizant  stockholders were eliminated as
a  result  of  the  exchange   offer.   Eliminating  IMS  Health  as  holder  of
approximately  55%  of  Cognizant's   outstanding  common  stock,   constituting
approximately 93% of the combined voting power of Cognizant's common stock, as a
result of the exchange  offer could  increase  Cognizant's  vulnerability  to an
unsolicited takeover proposal. The charter amendments,  together with the by-law
amendments and Cognizant's stockholders' rights plan will make it more difficult
for a potential  acquirer of Cognizant  to take  advantage  of  Cognizant's  new
capital  structure in acquiring  Cognizant by means of a transaction that is not
negotiated with Cognizant's Board of Directors.

     CLASSIFIED BOARD

     Cognizant's  certificate  of  incorporation  was  amended to provide  for a
classified  Board of Directors,  also known as a staggered  board.  The Board of
Directors,  other than  those  directors  who may be  elected by the  holders of
Cognizant's  preferred  stock,  will be divided into three  classes of directors
effective  as  of  the  first  annual  meeting  of  stockholders  following  the
completion of the exchange offer.




     Cognizant's  directors  will  be  elected  to  three  separate  classes  at
Cognizant's next annual meeting, as follows:

     o    two "Class I  Directors"  will be elected at  Cognizant's  next annual
          meeting to serve for a term  expiring at the first  annual  meeting of
          stockholders to be held following that meeting;

     o    two "Class II Directors"  will be elected at  Cognizant's  next annual
          meeting to serve for a term expiring at the second  annual  meeting of
          stockholders to be held following that meeting; and

     o    two "Class III Directors"  will be elected at Cognizant's  next annual
          meeting to serve for a term  expiring at the third  annual  meeting of
          stockholders to be held following that meeting.

     At each annual meeting  following  Cognizant's  next annual  meeting,  only
directors  of the class  whose term is  expiring  that year will be  required to
stand for  election,  and upon  election  each  director will serve a three-year
term. Any newly created directorship that results from an increase in the number
of directors  and any vacancy  occurring in the Board of Directors can be filled
only by a  majority  of the  directors  then in  office.  No change may have the
effect of removing any director from office.  Upon any change in the  authorized
number of directors,  the total number of directors  will be allocated as evenly
as possible among the three classes, provided that the term of office may not be
shortened for any incumbent director. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not
resulting  from an  increase  in the  number  of  directors  will  have the same
remaining term as that of his or her predecessor. Any director elected to fill a
newly created  directorship  resulting from an increase in the size of any class
will have the same remaining term as the other directors of that class.

     Cognizant's  certificate  of  incorporation  provides that directors can be
removed  only by the  affirmative  vote of at least 80% in  voting  power of all
outstanding  shares of Cognizant  common stock entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors.  In addition,  following  Cognizant's next annual meeting
and the  implementation  of the classified Board of Directors,  directors may be
removed only for cause.

     BOARD SIZE

     Cognizant's  certificate of  incorporation  was amended to provide that the
number of  Cognizant's  directors will be not less than three and that the exact
number of directors will be fixed from time to time by a majority of Cognizant's
Board of  Directors.  The Board of Directors set the number of directors at six,
which was effective immediately following consummation of the exchange offer.

     STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

     Unless  otherwise  provided in a company's  certificate  of  incorporation,
Delaware  law  permits  any  action   required  or  permitted  to  be  taken  by
stockholders  of a company at a meeting to be taken  without  notice,  without a
meeting and without a stockholder  vote if a written  consent  setting forth the
action to be taken is  signed by the  holders  of  shares of  outstanding  stock
having the  requisite  number of votes that would be necessary to authorize  the
action at a meeting of  stockholders  at which all shares  entitled to vote were
present and voted. Cognizant's Restated





Certificate  of  Incorporation  and Amended and  Restated  By-laws  require that
stockholder   action  be  taken  only  at  an  annual  or  special   meeting  of
stockholders, and prohibits stockholder action by written consent.

     STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT CALL A SPECIAL MEETING

     Upon the  consummation  of the exchange offer,  Cognizant's  certificate of
incorporation  was amended,  and  conforming  changes  were made to  Cognizant's
by-laws,  to prohibit  stockholders  from calling a special meeting,  to provide
that a special  meeting  of the  stockholders  may be  called  only by the chief
executive officer of Cognizant or Cognizant's Board of Directors, and to require
that business transacted at any special meeting be limited to the purpose stated
in the notice of the meeting.

     SUPERMAJORITY APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS

     Prior to the exchange offer,  in addition to approval by Cognizant's  Board
of  Directors,  the  approval of the  holders of a majority  in voting  power of
Cognizant's  outstanding  shares of stock entitled to vote was required to amend
any provision of Cognizant's certificate of incorporation.  Delaware law permits
a company to include provisions in its certificate of incorporation that require
a greater vote than the vote otherwise required by law for any corporate action.
Upon completion of the exchange offer,  Cognizant's certificate of incorporation
was  amended to require the  affirmative  vote of the holders of at least 80% in
voting power of the outstanding  shares of Cognizant  entitled to vote generally
in the  election of  directors,  voting  together as a single  class,  to amend,
alter, change, add to or repeal specified provisions of Cognizant's  certificate
of incorporation and any provision of the by-laws. The provisions in Cognizant's
certificate of incorporation affected by this amendment are:

     o    the provisions  concerning the classified board, the size of the board
          and the filling of board vacancies and newly created directorships;

     o    the provision concerning the inability of Cognizant's  stockholders to
          call special meetings;

     o    the provision concerning the inability of Cognizant's  stockholders to
          act by written consent; and

     o    the provisions  concerning the ability of Cognizant's  stockholders to
          amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the foregoing provisions of the
          certificate of incorporation or the by-laws.

     This supermajority voting requirement may discourage or deter a person from
attempting to obtain  control of Cognizant by making it more  difficult to amend
Cognizant's by-laws,  whether to eliminate provisions that have an anti-takeover
effect or those that  protect  the  interests  of  minority  stockholders.  This
supermajority voting amendment permits a minority of Cognizant's stockholders to
block an attempt by its stockholders to amend or repeal its by-laws.



AMENDMENTS TO COGNIZANT'S BY-LAWS

     In connection with the exchange offer,  Cognizant's Board of Directors also
approved  amendments to Cognizant's  by-laws,  which became effective  following
completion of the exchange  offer.  The material  terms of these  amendments are
summarized below. For complete information, you should read the full text of the
Amended and Restated By-laws, which has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to
the Company's  Current  Report of Form 8-K dated  February 13, 2003. The Amended
and Restated  By-laws are  incorporated  by reference into this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

     Cognizant's  Amended and Restated  By-laws  require  that, at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders, the only nominations of persons for election to
the Board of Directors and  proposals of business to be  considered  will be the
nominations made or proposals of business brought before the meeting:

     o    pursuant to Cognizant's notice of meeting;

     o    by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; and

     o    by a  stockholder  of  Cognizant  who was a  stockholder  of record of
          Cognizant  at the time of the  delivery of the notice  provided for in
          the  Amended  and  Restated  By-laws,  who is  entitled to vote at the
          meeting and who complies with the notice  procedures  set forth in the
          by-laws.

     These  amendments  may preclude  nominations  or the conduct of business by
stockholders at a particular  stockholders  meeting if the proper procedures are
not  followed,  and may  discourage  or deter a third party from  attempting  to
obtain control of Cognizant,  even if this attempt might be viewed as beneficial
to Cognizant by its stockholders.

STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

     In connection  with the completion of the exchange  offer, on March 5, 2003
Cognizant's  Board  of  Directors  adopted  a  stockholders'  rights  plan.  The
stockholders' rights plan did not require stockholder approval.

     The  stockholders'   rights  plan  provides  that  holders  of  Cognizant's
outstanding  Class A or  Class B common  stock  will  receive,  in the form of a
dividend,  a right to purchase  1/1000 of a share of a newly  created  series of
preferred  stock,  which  will  be  the  economic  equivalent  of one  share  of
Cognizant's  common stock. The rights will become  exercisable on the earlier of
(1) the tenth day following the public  announcement  that a person or group has
acquired  beneficial  ownership of 15% or more of Cognizant's total voting power
represented  by the Class A common  stock  and Class B common  stock and (2) the
tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by Cognizant's Board
of Directors) following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make
a tender offer or exchange  offer  pursuant to which a person would acquire more
than 15% of  Cognizant's  voting power.  The rights are redeemable at a price of
$.01 per right, by the vote of Cognizant's Board of Directors, at any time prior
to the





time a person  acquires more than 15% of the voting power. If any person were to
do so, each holder of a right (other than rights held by the  acquiring  person,
which  would  become  void)  will  receive,  upon  exercise  of the right at the
then-current  exercise price, shares of Cognizant's common stock having a market
value on that date of twice the exercise price of the right,  commonly  referred
to as a "flip-in  right." If the flip-in  right were  exercised,  the  acquiring
person's voting and economic interest in Cognizant would be dramatically diluted
by the issuance by  Cognizant of large  numbers of its shares of common stock to
its current stockholders other than the acquiring person at a reduced price. If,
after  any  person  acquired  shares of  Cognizant's  outstanding  common  stock
representing  more than 15% of the voting  power,  Cognizant  were acquired in a
business  consolidation or 50% or more of its assets or earning power were sold,
each holder of a right (other than rights held by the  acquiring  person,  which
would become void) will receive,  upon exercise of the right at the then-current
exercise  price,  shares of the  acquirer  having a market value on that date of
twice the  exercise  price of the right,  commonly  referred to as a  "flip-over
right."  This  would  cause  significant  dilution  to the  acquirer's  existing
stockholders.

     Any person owning in excess of 15% of Cognizant's  voting power on the date
of the  adoption  of the  plan or as a result  of the  exchange  offer  will not
trigger these rights so long as that person does not acquire additional shares.

Financial  Condition and Results of Operations" which are included  elsewhere in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.








Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

     Cognizant  is  a  leading  provider  of  custom  IT  design,   development,
integration  and  maintenance  services  primarily  for Fortune  1000  companies
located in the United States and Europe.  Cognizant's core competencies  include
web-centric  applications,  data  warehousing,  component-based  development and
legacy and client-server  systems.  Cognizant provides the IT services it offers
using   an   integrated   on-site/offshore   business   model.   This   seamless
onsite/offshore  business model combines  technical and account management teams
located on-site at the customer  location and offshore at dedicated  development
centers  located in India and Ireland.  Cognizant  began its IT development  and
maintenance   services  business  in  early  1994,  as  an  in-house  technology
development center for The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units.
In 1996, Cognizant, along with certain other entities, was spun-off from the Dun
& Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company,  Cognizant Corporation.  On June
24, 1998,  Cognizant completed its initial public offering.  On June 30, 1998, a
majority  interest in Cognizant,  and certain other  entities were spun-off from
Cognizant   Corporation  to  form  IMS  Health   Incorporated   ("IMS  Health").
Subsequently,   Cognizant   Corporation  was  renamed  Nielsen  Media  Research,
Incorporated.  At December 31, 2002,  IMS Health owned 55.3% of the  outstanding
stock of Cognizant  (representing  all of Cognizant's  Class B common stock) and
held 92.5% of the combined voting power of Cognizant's common stock.  Holders of
Cognizant's  Class A  common  stock  have  one vote per  share  and  holders  of
Cognizant's Class B common stock have ten votes per share.

     On June 30, 2002, the Company  acquired the assets of UHCI, a subsidiary of
UnitedHealth  Group.  UHCI  previously  provided,  and will  continue to provide
through CTS Ireland, application development and maintenance services, using the
existing staff of approximately 70 software  professionals.  This acquisition is
designed  to enable  the  Company to  provide a wide  range of  services  to the
Company's   clients  in  Europe  and  worldwide  and   represents   the  initial
implementation of the Company's  previously  announced  international  expansion
strategy.

     Additionally,  on October 29, 2002,  the Company  completed the transfer of
Silverline  Technologies,  Inc.'s  practice,  which  serviced a major  financial
services  company to the Company.  Under the terms of the transfer,  the Company
will provide  application design,  development and maintenance  services to such
major financial  services company through an acquired workforce of approximately
three  hundred IT and  support  professionals  located  primarily  in the United
States and India.

     On February 13, 2003, IMS Health  distributed  all of the Cognizant Class B
common stock that IMS Health owned (a total of 11,290,900 shares) in an exchange
offer to its  stockholders.  IMS Health  distributed  0.309  shares of Cognizant
Class B common  stock to its  stockholders  for every one share of IMS  Health's
common stock  tendered.  There was no impact on the number of Cognizant's  total
shares of common stock outstanding as a result of the completion of the exchange
offer.  As a direct  result  of the IMS  Health  exchange  offer  Cognizant  has
incurred charges in the fourth quarter of 2002 of $1.7 million and expects total
charges





aggregating  approximately $3.5 million. Such charges primarily relate to direct
and incremental legal, accounting,  printing and other costs. In addition, total
estimated  charges  include  approximately  $0.5 million of costs related to the
retention and acceleration of Cognizant stock options by two former Directors of
Cognizant who resigned on February 13, 2003 as a result of the split-off.  As of
February  21,  2003,   pursuant  to  the  Company's   Restated   Certificate  of
Incorporation,  all of the shares of Class B common stock  converted into shares
of Class A common stock.  Accordingly,  as of such date,  there are no shares of
Class B common stock outstanding.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RISKS

     Financial  Reporting  Release No. 60 requires  all  companies  to include a
discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of
financial statements.  Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements include a
summary  of  the  significant  accounting  policies  and  methods  used  in  the
preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is
a brief discussion of the more significant  accounting policies and methods used
by the Company.

     In addition,  Financial  Reporting Release No. 61 requires all companies to
include a discussion  to address,  among other  things,  liquidity,  off-balance
sheet arrangements, contractual obligations and commercial commitments.

     The  Company's  discussion  and  analysis of its  financial  condition  and
results of  operations  are based upon its  consolidated  financial  statements,
which have been  prepared in accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States.  The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles in the United States
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities,  including the recoverability of tangible and
intangible  assets,  disclosure of contingent  assets and  liabilities as of the
date of the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and
expenses during the reported period.

     On an  on-going  basis,  the  Company  evaluates  its  estimates.  The most
significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for
warranties,  reserves for employee benefits, income taxes, depreciation of fixed
assets and long-lived  assets,  contingencies and litigation and the recognition
of  revenue  and  profits  based  on the  percentage  of  completion  method  of
accounting for certain fixed-bid  contracts.  The Company bases its estimates on
historical  experience and on various other  assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable  under the  circumstances,  the  results  of which form the basis for
making  judgments about the carrying  values of assets and liabilities  that are
not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the
estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements.

     Most of the  Company's  IT  development  centers,  including a  substantial
majority of its employees are located in India. As a result,  the Company may be
subject to certain risks  associated with  international  operations,  including
risks  associated with foreign  currency  exchange rate  fluctuations  and risks
associated  with the  application  and imposition of protective  legislation and
regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign




policy or the variability of foreign economic  conditions.  To date, the Company
has not engaged in any hedging  transactions  to mitigate its risks  relating to
exchange rate  fluctuations.  Additional  risks  associated  with  international
operations include difficulties in enforcing  intellectual  property rights, the
burdens of complying  with a wide variety of foreign laws,  potentially  adverse
tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers.

     The Company believes the following critical  accounting policies affect its
more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of its
consolidated financial statements:

     REVENUE  RECOGNITION.  The Company's  services are entered into on either a
time-and-materials  or fixed-price basis.  Revenues related to time-and-material
contracts  are  recognized  as the  service is  performed.  Revenues  related to
fixed-price contracts that provide for application  development services or that
provide for a combination of application  development and application management
services   are   recognized   as   the   service   is   performed    using   the
percentage-of-completion  method of  accounting,  under which the sales value of
performance  is recognized on the basis of the percentage  that each  contract's
cost to date bears to the total estimated cost. Revenues related to fixed-priced
contracts  that  provided  solely  for  application   management   services  are
recognized on a straight-line  basis or as services are rendered or transactions
processed in accordance with contract  terms.  Expenses are recorded as incurred
over the contract period.

     In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus
in EITF 00-21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables".  The consensus,
which is effective for contracts  entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June  15,  2003,  requires  that  a  Company  evaluate  all  deliverables  in an
arrangement to determine  whether they  represent  separate units of accounting.
That  evaluation  must be performed at the inception of the  arrangement  and as
each item in the arrangement is delivered.  Arrangement  consideration should be
then allocated  among the separate  units of accounting  based on their relative
fair values.  EITF 00-21  indicates  that the best evidence of fair value is the
price of a deliverable  when it is regularly sold on a stand-alone  basis.  Fair
value evidence often consists of entity-specific  or  vendor-specific  objective
evidence of fair value.

     The Company  enters into  contracts  that could be considered  arrangements
with multiple  deliverables.  These contracts are primarily  long-term fixed-bid
contracts that provide both application  maintenance and application development
services.  As  indicated  above  and in  Note 2 to  the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements,  the  Company  accounts  for  such  contracts  using  percentage  of
completion  accounting.  The Company is  currently  evaluating  the  prospective
impact of EITF 00-21 on the Company's results of operations related to contracts
entered into after June 15, 2003.

     Fixed-price contracts are cancelable  subject to a specified notice period.
All services  provided by the Company through the date of  cancellation  are due
and payable under the contract  terms.  The Company issues  invoices  related to
fixed price contracts based upon  achievement of milestones  during a project or
other contractual terms.  Differences between the timing of billings, based upon
contract  milestones or other contractual terms, and the recognition of revenue,
based upon the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, are recognized as





either  unbilled or deferred  revenue.  Estimates are subject to adjustment as a
project  progresses  to  reflect  changes  in  expected  completion  costs.  The
cumulative  impact of any revision in  estimates  is reflected in the  financial
reporting  period  in  which  the  change  in  estimate  becomes  known  and any
anticipated  losses on  contracts  are  recognized  immediately.  A reserve  for
warranty provisions under such contracts,  which generally exist for ninety days
past contract completion, is estimated and accrued during the contract period.

     Revenues related to services  performed  without a signed agreement or work
order are not recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement, such as when
agreements  or work orders are signed or payment is  received;  however the cost
related to the performance of such work is recognized in the period the services
are  rendered.  Such  revenue  is  recognized  when,  and  if,  evidence  of  an
arrangement is obtained.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.  The assets and liabilities of the Company's
Canadian and European  subsidiaries  are translated into U.S. dollars from local
currencies at current  exchange  rates and revenues and expenses are  translated
from  local   currencies  at  average  monthly  exchange  rates.  The  resulting
translation  adjustments are recorded in a separate  component of  stockholders'
equity.  For the Company's  Indian  subsidiary  ("CTS  India"),  the  functional
currency is the U.S.  dollar,  since its sales are made  primarily in the United
States,  the sales price is  predominantly  in U.S.  dollars and there is a high
volume of  intercompany  transactions  denominated in U.S.  dollars  between CTS
India  and  its  U.S.  affiliates.   Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are
translated at historical  exchange rates,  while monetary assets and liabilities
are translated at current  exchange rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included
in other income.

     ALLOWANCE  FOR DOUBTFUL  ACCOUNTS.  The Company  maintains  allowances  for
doubtful  accounts for  estimated  losses  resulting  from the  inability of its
customers to make required  payments.  The  allowance  for doubtful  accounts is
determined by evaluating the relative  credit-worthiness  of each customer based
upon market  capitalization  and other  information,  including the aging of the
receivables.  If the  financial  condition of the  Company's  customers  were to
deteriorate,  resulting  in an  impairment  of their  ability to make  payments,
additional allowances may be required.

     INCOME  TAXES.  The  Company  records a valuation  allowance  to reduce its
deferred  tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be  realized.
While the Company has considered  future taxable income and on-going prudent and
feasible  tax  planning  strategies  in  assessing  the need  for the  valuation
allowance,  in the event the Company were to determine  that it would be able to
realize  its  deferred  tax assets in the  future in excess of its net  recorded
amount,  an  adjustment to the deferred tax asset would  increase  income in the
period such determination was made. Likewise,  should the Company determine that
it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the
future,  an  adjustment  to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or
equity (if the deferred  tax asset is related to tax benefits  from stock option
benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made.

     Cognizant's  Indian subsidiary,  CTS India, is an export-oriented  company,
which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays
for a period of ten years with respect to its export profits.  Substantially all
of the  earnings  of CTS  India  are  attributable  to  export  profits  and are
therefore  currently  entitled to a 90% exemption  from Indian income tax.



These tax  holidays  will begin to expire in 2004 and under  current law will be
completely  phased  out by  March of 2009.  Prior to 2002,  it was  management's
intent to repatriate all  accumulated  earnings from India to the United States;
accordingly,  Cognizant  has  provided  deferred  income  taxes in the amount of
approximately $24.9 million on all such undistributed  earnings through December
31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002,  Cognizant made a strategic decision
to  pursue an  international  strategy  that  includes  expanded  infrastructure
investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component
of this strategy,  Cognizant  intends to use 2002 and future Indian  earnings to
expand  operations  outside of the United States instead of  repatriating  these
earnings to the United States. Accordingly,  effective January 1, 2002, pursuant
to Accounting  Principles  Bulletin 23, Cognizant will no longer accrue taxes on
the repatriation of earnings  recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these
earnings are  considered  to be  indefinitely  reinvested  outside of the United
States. As of December 31, 2002, the amount of unrepatriated earnings upon which
no provision for taxation has been recorded is approximately  $30.1 million.  If
such  earnings  are  repatriated  in the future,  or are no longer  deemed to be
indefinitely  reinvested,  Cognizant will accrue the applicable  amount of taxes
associated with such earnings. Due to the various methods by which such earnings
could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine
the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation.

     This  change  in  intent,  as well  as a  change  in the  manner  in  which
repatriated earnings are taxed in India,  resulted in an estimated effective tax
rate for the year ended  December  31, 2002 of 23.4%.  This rate  compares to an
effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 37.4%.

     Effective  April 1, 2002,  the  government of India passed  various tax law
changes  which  affected  the way in which the  Company's  earnings are taxed in
India.  The tax  exemption  for export  earnings was reduced from 100% to 90%, a
surtax was imposed increasing the effective rate from 35.7% to 36.75% for income
that is subject to tax, and the corporate  level tax on the payment of dividends
was replaced with a withholding tax on dividends.

     Cognizant's  cash   requirements   could  change  over  time,  which  could
effectively  force it to change its intent on repatriating  Indian earnings.  If
Cognizant's  earnings are intended to be  repatriated  in the future,  or are no
longer reinvested  outside the United States,  Cognizant will have to accrue the
applicable  amount of taxes  associated  with such  earnings  and pay taxes at a
substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2002. These increased taxes
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on  Cognizant's  business,  results  of
operations and financial condition, as well as cash flows to fund such taxes. In
addition,  Cognizant may need to accelerate the payment of significant  deferred
taxes, which would have a significant impact on its cash position.

     GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES.  Prior to 2002, goodwill,  which related to
the  acquisition  of  the  former  minority  interest  in the  Company's  Indian
subsidiary,  was amortized  using the straight-line basis over a period of seven
years.  Effective  January 1, 2002,  in accordance  with  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets"
("FAS 142"), the Company is no longer amortizing its remaining goodwill balance;
however,  at each balance  date,  the Company does  evaluate  goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant.
If such assets were determined to



be impaired,  it could have a material  adverse effect on Cognizant's  business,
results of operations and financial condition.

     LONG-LIVED  ASSETS.  In accordance  with Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  ("SFAS")  No.  144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of
Long-Lived  Assets",  which  was  adopted  in  2002,  the  Company  reviews  for
impairment  long-lived  assets and  certain  identifiable  intangibles  whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be  recoverable.  In general,  the Company will  recognize an impairment
loss when the sum of  undiscounted  expected  future cash flows is less than the
carrying  amount of such assets.  The measurement for such an impairment loss is
then based on the fair value of the asset.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001

     REVENUE.  Revenue increased by 28.9%, or approximately $51.3 million,  from
approximately  $177.8  million  during 2001 to  approximately  $229.1 million in
2002.  This  increase  resulted   primarily  from  an  increase  in  application
management and application  development and  integration  services.  The Company
provides  services  through time and materials  ("T&M") and fixed-bid contracts.
Over the course of the last three  years  revenues  recognized  under  fixed-bid
contracts  have  increased as a percent of total  revenues from 15.1% in 2000 to
23.9% in 2001 and 24.6% in 2002.  This  increase is  attributable  primarily  to
increased demand for such services due to the customer's ability to specifically
quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts.

     Sales to  related  parties  on a  year-over-year  basis  were 10.6% in 2001
compared to 8.9% in 2002.  For statement of operations  purposes,  revenues from
related parties only include revenues  recognized during the period in which the
related party was  affiliated  with the Company.  During 2001 and 2002, no third
party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues.

     GROSS PROFIT. The Company's cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost
of salaries,  payroll  taxes,  benefits,  immigration  and travel for  technical
personnel,  and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Company's
cost of revenues  increased  by 35.1%,  or  approximately  $31.9  million,  from
approximately $90.8 million during 2001 to approximately $122.7 million in 2002.
The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase
in the number of the Company's technical  professionals from approximately 3,470
employees at December 31, 2001 to over 6,100 employees at December 31, 2002. The
increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand
for the Company's services and on employees acquired through acquisitions.  (See
Note 2 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.)  The Company's gross profit
increased by 22.4%, or approximately  $19.5 million,  from  approximately  $86.9
million during 2001 to  approximately  $106.4 million during 2002.  Gross profit
margin  decreased  from 48.9% of  revenues  during  2001 to 46.4% of revenues in
2002.  The decrease in such gross profit  margin was primarily  attributable  to
higher  incentive  compensation  costs in 2002 as compared  to 2001,  due to the
significantly increased performance of the Company.

     SELLING,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE   EXPENSES.   Selling,  general  and
administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  employee  benefits,
travel,  promotion,  communications,  management,  finance,  administrative  and
occupancy  costs.  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses,   including
depreciation  and  amortization,  increased  by  19.2%,  or  approximately  $9.9
million,  from  approximately  $51.3 million during 2001 to approximately  $61.2
million during 2002, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately
28.9% to 26.7%, respectively.  The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars
was due  primarily  to  expenses  incurred  to expand  the  Company's  sales and
marketing  activities  and  increased  infrastructure  expenses  to support  the
Company's  growth.  The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was
due  primarily to the  increased  revenues that have resulted from the Company's
expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years.





     INCOME  FROM  OPERATIONS.   Income  from  operations  increased  26.9%,  or
approximately  $9.6 million,  from  approximately  $35.6 million  during 2001 to
approximately  $45.2 million during 2002,  representing  approximately 20.0% and
19.7% of  revenues,  respectively.  The  decrease  in  operating  margin was due
primarily to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001.

     OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE.  Other income/expense  consists primarily of interest
income offset,  by foreign currency  exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment
loss on an  investment,  and in 2002,  split-off  costs  related to the exchange
offer in which IMS  Health has  offered  to its  stockholders  to  exchange  its
holdings  of the  Company's  Class B common  stock  for  shares  of IMS  Health.
Interest  income  decreased by  approximately  27.7%,  from  approximately  $2.5
million during 2001 to  approximately  $1.8 million during 2002. The decrease in
such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset,
in part, by higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign
currency  exchange  loss of  approximately  $767,000  during 2001 compared to an
exchange loss of  approximately  $235,000 during 2002, as a result of the effect
of changing exchange rates on the Company's transactions. The Company recognized
an impairment  loss on its  investment  in Questra  Corporation  ("Questra")  of
approximately  $2.0 million  during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of
an other than temporary  decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an
implied  valuation  of  Questra  as a result of a recent  new  round of  venture
capital  funding  in  which  the  Company's   equity  interest  in  Questra  was
substantially   diluted  and  investors,   other  than  the  Company,   received
preferential  liquidation  rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit,  was
approximately  $1.2  million,  or $0.06 per  diluted  share.  (See Note 4 to the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements).  The Company recognized split-off costs of
approximately $1.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of
2002  related  to the  exchange  offer and  expects  total  charges  aggregating
approximately  $3.5 million in relation to one-time  costs  associated  with the
exchange offer. Such charges  primarily relate to direct and incremental  legal,
accounting,  printing and other  costs.  In addition,  total  estimated  charges
include  approximately  $0.5  million  of costs  related  to the  retention  and
acceleration of Cognizant stock options by two former Directors of Cognizant who
resigned on February 13, 2003 as a result of the split-off.

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  The provision for income taxes  decreased from
approximately $13.2 million in 2001 to approximately $10.5 million in 2002, with
an effective  tax rate of 37.4% in 2001 and 23.4% in 2002.  The lower  effective
tax rate reflects Cognizant's change in its intention regarding the repatriation
of 2002 and future earnings from its subsidiary in India, as well as a change in
the manner in which repatriated  earnings are taxed in India. (See Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.)

     NET INCOME. Net income increased from  approximately  $22.2 million in 2001
to approximately  $34.6 million in 2002,  representing  approximately  12.5% and
15.1% as a percentage of revenues,  respectively.  The higher percentage in 2002
primarily reflects the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above.





RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

     The Company, operating globally,  provides software services for medium and
large  businesses.  North  American  operations  consist  primarily  of software
services  in the  United  States  and  Canada.  European  operations  consist of
software services principally in the United Kingdom. Asian operations consist of
software  services  principally in India. The Company is managed on a geographic
basis. Accordingly,  regional sales managers, sales managers,  account managers,
project teams and facilities are segmented  geographically  and decisions by the
Company's chief operating  decision maker regarding the allocation of assets and
assessment of performance  are based on such  geographic  segmentation.  In this
regard,  revenues are allocated to each geographic area based on the location of
the customer.

North American Segment

     REVENUE.  Revenue increased by 31.4%, or approximately $47.7 million,  from
approximately  $151.9  million  during 2001 to  approximately  $199.6 million in
2002.  The increase in revenue was  attributable  primarily to increased  market
awareness and acceptance of the  on-site/offshore  software  delivery  model, as
well as sales and  marketing  activities  directed  at the U.S.  market  for the
Company's services.

     INCOME  FROM  OPERATIONS.   Income  from  operations  increased  29.4%,  or
approximately  $8.9 million,  from  approximately  $30.4 million  during 2001 to
approximately  $39.4 million during 2002.  The increase in operating  income was
attributable  primarily to increased  revenues and  achieving  leverage on prior
sales and marketing investments.

European Segment

     REVENUE.  Revenue increased by 15.1%, or approximately  $3.7 million,  from
approximately  $24.2 million during 2001 to approximately $27.9 million in 2002.
The increase in revenue was  attributable  to the Company's  sales and marketing
activities  in the  United  Kingdom,  partially  offset by weak  demand  for the
Company's services elsewhere in Europe.

     INCOME  FROM  OPERATIONS.   Income  from  operations  increased  13.2%,  or
approximately  $0.6  million,  from  approximately  $4.9 million  during 2001 to
approximately  $5.5 million  during 2002.  The increase in operating  income was
attributable  primarily to increased  revenues and  achieving  leverage on prior
sales and marketing investments.

Asian Segment

     REVENUE.   Revenue  was   essentially   constant   from  2001  to  2002  at
approximately $1.6 million in each year.

     INCOME FROM  OPERATIONS.  Income from operations was  essentially  constant
from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $0.3 million in each year.




YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000

     REVENUE.  Revenue increased by 29.7%, or approximately $40.7 million,  from
approximately  $137.0  million  during 2000 to  approximately  $177.8 million in
2001.  This  increase  resulted  primarily  from  approximately  a $27.7 million
(42.9%)  increase in application  management and  approximately  a $13.5 million
(18.8%) increase in application development and integration, partially offset by
an  approximately  $0.5  million  (100.0%)  decrease  in  Year  2000  compliance
services.  The Company  provides  services  through T&M and fixed-bid contracts.
Over the course of the last three years fixed-bid contracts  have increased as a
percent of revenues from 15.0% in 1999 to 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001.

     Sales to related parties on a year-over-year  basis were relatively  stable
at  10.6%  in 2001  compared  to 10.4% in  2000.  For  statement  of  operations
purposes,  revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during
the period in which the related party was  affiliated  with the Company.  During
2001 and 2000, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues.

     GROSS PROFIT. The Company's cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost
of salaries,  payroll  taxes,  benefits,  immigration  and travel for  technical
personnel,  and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Company's
cost of revenues  increased  by 29.0%,  or  approximately  $20.4  million,  from
approximately  $70.4 million during 2000 to approximately $90.8 million in 2001.
The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase
in the number of the Company's technical  professionals from approximately 2,800
employees at December 31, 2000 to approximately  3,470 employees at December 31,
2001.  The  increased  number of technical  professionals  is a direct result of
greater demand for the Company's services.  The Company's gross profit increased
by 30.5%,  or  approximately  $20.3 million,  from  approximately  $66.6 million
during 2000 to  approximately  $86.9 during 2001.  Gross profit margin increased
from 48.6% of revenues during 2000 to 48.9% of revenues in 2001. The increase in
such gross profit margin was primarily  attributable to a continued shift toward
higher margin fixed-bid contracts and a lower incentive  compensation accrual in
2001 as compared to 2000.

     SELLING,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE   EXPENSES.   Selling,  general  and
administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  employee  benefits,
travel,  promotion,  communications,  management,  finance,  administrative  and
occupancy  costs.  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses,   including
depreciation  and  amortization,  increased  by 26.8%,  or  approximately  $10.8
million,  from  approximately  $40.5 million during 2000 to approximately  $51.3
million during 2001, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately
29.5% to 28.9%, respectively.  The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars
was due  primarily  to  expenses  incurred  to expand  the  Company's  sales and
marketing  activities  and  increased  infrastructure  expenses  to support  the
Company's  growth.  The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was
primarily  due to the  increased  revenues that have resulted from the Company's
expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years.

     INCOME  FROM  OPERATIONS.   Income  from  operations  increased  36.3%,  or
approximately  $9.5 million,  from  approximately  $26.1 million  during 2000 to
approximately  $35.6 million during 2001,  representing  approximately 19.1% and
20.0% of revenues, respectively. The



increase in  operating  margin was  primarily  due to a continued  shift  toward
higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower incentive  compensation accrual in
2001 as compared to 2000.

     OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE.  Other income/expense  consists primarily of interest
income offset,  by foreign currency  exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment
loss on an investment.  Interest income  decreased by  approximately  5.6%, from
approximately  $2.6 million  during 2000 to  approximately  $2.5 million  during
2001. The decrease in such interest income was  attributable  primarily to lower
interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances.  The Company
recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during
2001,  as a result of the effect of  changing  exchange  rates on the  Company's
transactions.  The Company  recognized an impairment  loss on its  investment in
Questra of  approximately  $2.0  million  during  the fourth  quarter of 2001 in
recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was
based upon an implied  valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of
venture  capital  funding in which the Company's  equity interest in Questra was
substantially   diluted  and  investors,   other  than  the  Company,   received
preferential  liquidation  rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit,  was
approximately  $1.2  million  or $0.06  per  diluted  share.  (See Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements)

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Historically,  through the date of the IPO, the
Company had been included in the consolidated  federal income tax returns of The
Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation.  The Company's provision
for income taxes in the  consolidated  statements of income reflects the federal
and state  income taxes  calculated  on the  Company's  stand-alone  basis.  The
provision for income taxes increased from approximately $10.6 million in 2000 to
approximately $13.2 million in 2001, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in both
years.  The  provision  for  income  taxes  reflects  the  Company's  intent  to
repatriate earnings from its Indian subsidiary.

     NET INCOME. Net income increased from  approximately  $17.7 million in 2000
to approximately  $22.2 million in 2001,  representing  approximately  12.9% and
12.5% as a percentage of revenues,  respectively.  The lower  percentage in 2001
reflects  the  one-time  write-off  of  the  Company's  investment  in  Questra,
discussed previously.

RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

North American Segment

     REVENUE.  Revenue increased by 32.2%, or approximately $37.0 million,  from
approximately  $114.9  million  during 2000 to  approximately  $151.9 million in
2001.  The increase in revenue was  attributable  primarily to increased  market
awareness and acceptance of the  on-site/offshore  software  delivery  model, as
well as sales and  marketing  activities  directed  at the U.S.  market  for the
Company's services.

     INCOME  FROM  OPERATIONS.   Income  from  operations  increased  38.9%,  or
approximately  $8.5 million,  from  approximately  $21.9 million  during 2000 to
approximately  $30.4 million during 2001.  The increase in operating  income was
attributable  primarily to increased  revenues and  achieving  leverage on prior
sales and marketing investments.

     REVENUE.  Revenue increased by 15.6%, or approximately  $3.3 million,  from
approximately  $21.0 million during 2000 to approximately $24.2 million in 2001.
The increase in revenue was  attributable  to the Company's  sales and marketing
activities  in the  United  Kingdom,  partially  offset by weak  demand  for the
Company's services elsewhere in Europe.

     INCOME  FROM  OPERATIONS.   Income  from  operations  increased  21.7%,  or
approximately  $0.9  million,  from  approximately  $4.0 million  during 2000 to
approximately  $4.9 million  during 2001.  The increase in operating  income was
attributable  primarily to increased  revenues and  achieving  leverage on prior
sales and marketing investments.

Asian Segment

     REVENUE.  Revenue increased by 42.5%, or approximately  $0.5 million,  from
approximately  $1.1 million during 2000 to  approximately  $1.6 million in 2001.
The increase in revenue was attributable  primarily to the Company's  success in
India providing  software  services to domestic  Indian  companies as well as to
Indian divisions of the Company's multi-national clients.

     INCOME  FROM  OPERATIONS.   Income  from  operations  increased  50.5%,  or
approximately  $0.1  million,  from  approximately  $0.2 million  during 2000 to
approximately  $0.3 million  during 2001.  The increase in operating  income was
attributable primarily to increased revenues.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     At  December  31,  2002,  the  Company  had cash and  cash  equivalents  of
approximately $126 million.  The Company has used and plans to use such cash for
(i)  expansion  of  existing   operations,   including  its  offshore   software
development  centers;  (ii)  continued  development  of new  service  lines  and
possible  acquisitions of related  businesses,  and formation of joint ventures;
and (iii) general corporate purposes, including working capital.

     Net cash provided by operating  activities was approximately $56.7 million,
$32.1 million and $30.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and
2000, respectively.  The increase in 2002 as compared to the prior year resulted
primarily  from  increased  net income,  increased  accrued  employee  incentive
payments,  which  resulted  in higher  levels of year-end  accrued  liabilities,
increased  tax benefits  related to stock plans,  offset,  in part, by a greater
increase in accounts  receivable  then the prior year.  The  increase in 2001 as
compared to 2000 results primarily from increased levels of accrued  liabilities
and accounts  payable,  increased net income and an increase in deferred  taxes,
partially offset, by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets.

     Trade accounts  receivable  increased from  approximately  $20.5 million at
December  31, 2000 to  approximately  $22.5  million at December 31, 2001 and to
approximately  $36.7 million at December 31, 2002.  Unbilled accounts receivable
increased  from   approximately  $1.9  million  at  December  31,  2000  and  to
approximately  $5.4 million at December 31, 2001 and decreased to  approximately
$4.3  million at December 31, 2002.  The increase in trade  accounts  receivable
during 2002 was due  primarily  to increased  revenue.  The decrease in unbilled
accounts




receivable in 2002 compared to the prior year was primarily related to timing of
fixed- bid contractual  billings.  The Company monitors turnover,  aging and the
collection of accounts  receivable  through the use of management  reports which
are prepared on a customer  basis and evaluated by the Company's  finance staff.
At December 31, 2002, the Company's day's sales outstanding,  including unbilled
receivables,  was  approximately  56 days as  compared to 59 days and 50 days at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     The Company's  investing  activities used net cash of  approximately  $35.5
million,  $14.9 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The increase in 2002  compared to 2001  primarily
reflects the Company's  increased  purchases of property and equipment to expand
the  Company's  offshore  development  infrastructure  and the  acquisitions  of
intangible assets related to UHCI and Silverline Technologies,  Inc. (See Note 4
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The increase in 2001 of net cash used
in investing  activities as compared to 2000  primarily  reflects an increase in
purchases of property and equipment.

     In June 2000, the Company  announced a strategic  relationship with Trident
Capital,  a  leading  venture  capital  firm,  to  jointly  invest  in  emerging
e-business service and technology  companies.  In accordance with this strategy,
the Company invested approximately $2 million in Questra, an e-business software
and  consulting  firm  headquartered  in  Rochester,  New York, in return for an
initial 5.8% equity interest.  Trident Capital also  independently made a direct
investment in Questra. Based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of
a recent new round of venture  capital  funding  in which the  Company's  equity
interest in Questra was  substantially  diluted  and  investors,  other than the
Company,  received  preferential  liquidation  rights,  the Company  recorded an
impairment loss for the full $2.0 million original  investment in recognition of
an other than temporary impairment.  The Company's investment is being accounted
for  under  the  cost  basis  of  accounting.  (See  Note 4 to the  Consolidated
Financial Statements.)

     The Company's  financing  activities provided net cash of approximately $20
million,  $6 million,  and $1.8  million for the years ended  December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.  The increase in each year was primarily related to
a higher level of cash  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee
purchases of stock.

     The Company  believes that its available  funds and the cash flows expected
to be  generated  from  operations,  will be adequate to satisfy its current and
planned  operations  and needs for at least the next 12  months.  The  Company's
ability to expand and grow its business in  accordance  with current  plans,  to
make  acquisitions  and form joint  ventures and to meet its  long-term  capital
requirements beyond this 12-month period will depend on many factors,  including
the rate, if any, at which its cash flow increases,  its ability and willingness
to accomplish  acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, its continued
intent not to  repatriate  earnings  from  India,  its ability not to breach the
Distribution  Agreement,  dated  January 7, 2003,  between  the  Company and IMS
Health  (the  "Distribution  Agreement"),   especially  as  it  relates  to  tax
indemnities  and the  availability to the Company of public and private debt and
equity financing.  The Company cannot be certain that additional  financing,  if
required, will be available on terms favorable to it, if at all.




     At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
approximately  $126  million and $85 million,  respectively.  As of December 31,
2002 and 2001 the Company had no  significant  third party debt. The Company had
working capital of  approximately  $134.3 and $95.6 million at December 31, 2002
and  2001,  respectively.  Accordingly,  the  Company  does not  anticipate  any
near-term liquidity issues.

     The Company does not engage in hedging  activities  nor has it entered into
off-balance  sheet  transactions,   arrangements  or  other  relationships  with
unconsolidated  entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or
the availability of or requirements for capital resources.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     As of  December  31,  2002,  the Company  has  entered  into fixed  capital
commitments  related  to its  India  development  center  expansion  program  of
approximately  $28.8  million,  of which  approximately  $19.2  million has been
spent.  The multi-phase  program will encompass the  construction of three fully
owned development centers containing  approximately 620,000 square feet of space
in Pune, Chennai and Calcutta.  Total costs related to this program are expected
to be approximately $35.6 million, which the Company expects to fund internally.

     The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases, which
expire at various dates through the year 2011.  Certain leases  contain  renewal
provisions and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes,
and other  operating  expenses.  Future minimum rental  payments under operating
leases that have  initial or  remaining  lease terms in excess of one year as of
December 31, 2002 are as follows:

 2003................................................................$5,799
 2004.................................................................3,829
 2005.................................................................2,229
 2006.................................................................1,755
 2007.................................................................1,252
 Thereafter...........................................................2,090
 Total minimum lease payments.......................................$16,954

     Cognizant is involved in various  claims and legal  actions  arising in the
ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management,  the outcome of such
claims  and legal  actions,  if decided  adversely,  is not  expected  to have a
material adverse effect on Cognizant's  quarterly or annual  operating  results,
cash  flows,  or  consolidated   financial  position.   Additionally,   many  of
Cognizant's  engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of
its customers' business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any
failure in a customer's  computer system could result in a claim for substantial
damages against  Cognizant,  regardless of Cognizant's  responsibility  for such
failure.  Although Cognizant  attempts to contractually  limit its liability for
damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering
its application design,  development and maintenance  services,  there can be no
assurance  that the  limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be
enforceable in all instances or will otherwise  protect Cognizant from liability
for  damages.  Although  Cognizant  has general  liability  insurance  coverage,
including coverage for errors or omissions,  there can be no assurance that such
coverage will continue to be available on reasonable  terms or will be available
in  sufficient




amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim
coverage as to any future claim.  The successful  assertion of one or more large
claims against Cognizant that exceed available  insurance coverage or changes in
Cognizant's insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of
large  deductible or co-insurance  requirements,  could have a material  adverse
effect on Cognizant's  business,  results of operations and financial condition.
In addition,  as a result of the IMS Health  split-off,  the Company has entered
into certain  agreements and  indemnifications  (See Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements).

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

     As indicated in Notes 1 and 9 and 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company has entered into various agreements with IMS Health, who
owned a majority and controlling interest in the outstanding common stock of the
Company (55.3%) and held approximately 92.5% of the combined voting power of the
Company's  common stock at December 31, 2002.  On February 13, 2003,  IMS Health
completed its plan to distribute all of the Cognizant  Class B common stock that
IMS Health owned in the exchange offer,  which is the subject of Amendment No. 4
to Form S-4 Registration  Statement filed by the Company on January 30, 2003. As
of the completion of such distribution,  IMS Health is no longer a related party
of Cognizant.

     INTERCOMPANY SERVICES AGREEMENT

     Prior to the  consummation of the exchange offer,  pursuant to the terms of
an  Intercompany  Services  Agreement,  dated  as of May 15,  1998,  IMS  Health
provided the Company with certain administrative services, including payroll and
payables  processing  and permitted the Company to  participate  in IMS Health's
business  insurance  plans. In prior periods,  IMS Health provided certain other
services such as tax planning and compliance,  which have now been  transitioned
to the Company.  Costs for all periods prior to the Company's IPO were allocated
to the Company based on utilization of certain specific services. All subsequent
services  were  performed  and charged to the Company  under the CTS/IMS  Health
intercompany  services  agreement that was negotiated  between the parties on an
arms length basis. IMS Health and Cognizant entered into an amended and restated
Intercompany  Services  Agreement,  effective  following the consummation of the
exchange offer, which provides for the continued provision of payroll,  payables
processing  and certain  other  administrative  services for a term of up to one
year.

     MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT

     The Company and IMS Health have  entered  into Master  Services  Agreements
pursuant  to which the  Company  provides  IT  services  to IMS  Health.  The IT
services  are provided to IMS Health on terms that are  comparable  to unrelated
third parties. The same is true for IT services provided to former affiliates of
The Dun and Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation,  former parents of
the  Company,  and former and present  affiliates  of IMS Health.  In 2002,  the
Company  recognized  related party revenues  totaling $20.4 million for services
performed for IMS Health. In 2001, the Company recognized related party revenues
totaling  $18.8  million for services  performed  for IMS Health.  In 2000,  the
Company recognized related party revenues




totaling  $14.3  million  including  revenues  from  IMS  Health  and  Strategic
Technologies (through August 30, 2000).

     DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

     The Company and IMS Health  entered into the  Distribution  Agreement,  the
terms of which  have  been  approved  by a  special  committee  of the  Board of
Directors  of the Company,  which was  comprised  of the  Company's  independent
directors.  The Distribution Agreement sets forth certain rights and obligations
of IMS Health and the  Company in respect of the  exchange  offer in addition to
those provided in the Intercompany Agreement. For a more complete description of
the  terms  of the  Distribution  Agreement,  we  urge  you to read  the  entire
Distribution  Agreement,  which has been  filed  with the SEC as an  exhibit  to
Amendment No. 4 to Form S-4 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on January
30, 2003.

     AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTION

     Director  Resignations.  IMS  Health  caused  David M.  Thomas and Nancy E.
     ----------------------
Cooper  to  resign as of the  consummation  of the  exchange  offer  from  their
positions  as  directors  of the Company and from any boards of directors of the
Company's subsidiaries on which they served.

     Indemnification.  IMS Health and the Company have agreed to indemnification
     ---------------
provisions  in  respect  of the  respective  disclosure  in the  exchange  offer
documents,  the  conduct of the  exchange  offer and any  failure to perform the
Distribution Agreement.

     Joint and Several Undertakings. IMS Health requested, as a condition to the
     ------------------------------
distribution  of the Company's  shares in the exchange  offer,  that the Company
agree to undertake to be jointly and severally liable to certain of IMS Health's
prior  affiliates  for  liabilities  arising  out of or in  connection  with IMS
Health's  business and the businesses of the Company and other successors to the
businesses  of  Cognizant  Corporation  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of the
Distribution   Agreement   dated  as  of  October  28,  1996,   among  Cognizant
Corporation,  which has been renamed  Nielsen Media  Research,  Inc.,  The Dun &
Bradstreet Corporation, which has been renamed the R.H. Donnelly Corporation and
ACNielsen  Corporation  and  related  agreements.  In  addition,  IMS  Health is
obligated  to procure  similar  undertakings  from the Company to Nielsen  Media
Research and Synavant Inc. with respect to  liabilities  allocated to IMS Health
in  connection  with the  Distribution  Agreement,  dated  as of June 30,  1998,
between Nielsen Media Research,  Inc. and IMS Health and related  agreements and
the Distribution Agreement,  dated as of August 31, 2000, between IMS Health and
Synavant  Inc. The Company has agreed to deliver  these  undertakings.  However,
subject to the general  allocation of  liabilities  arising from the  respective
businesses of IMS Health and the Company, IMS Health has agreed to indemnify and
reimburse   the  Company  for   liabilities   incurred  with  respect  to  these
undertakings.

     Commercial Arrangements.   In  addition  to  the  Intercompany   Services
     -----------------------
Agreement,  IMS Health and the  Company  agreed to the  continuation  of certain
commercial  relationships  between the  companies for a period of at least three
years.




     Insurance.  The Distribution  Agreement includes  provisions  governing the
     ---------
administration  of certain  insurance  programs and procedures for making claims
and it also  allocates the right to proceeds and the  allocation of  deductibles
under these programs.

     Tax. The  Distribution  Agreement  provides that IMS Health and the Company
     ---
will comply with,  and not take any action  during the relevant time period that
is inconsistent with, the representations  made to and relied upon by McDermott,
Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the exchange offer.

     In addition,  under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  "Code"),  the exchange  offer will be taxable to IMS Health if the
exchange offer is part of a plan or series of related  transactions  pursuant to
which one or more persons acquire  directly or indirectly  stock  representing a
50% or greater  interest,  based on either  vote or value,  in IMS Health or the
Company.  If IMS Health becomes subject to tax under Section 355(e) of the Code,
its tax  liability  will be based upon the  difference  between  the fair market
value of the  Cognizant  Class B common stock at the time of the exchange  offer
and IMS Health's  adjusted  basis in the Cognizant  Class B common stock at that
time. This tax liability could be a material amount.

     If a breach by the Company of the representations  made by it to McDermott,
Will &  Emery  in  connection  with  its tax  opinion  or the  covenants  in the
distribution  agreement  is the "but for"  cause of the  exchange  offer  either
failing to qualify as a tax-free  distribution  under Section 355(a) of the Code
or becoming  taxable to IMS Health under  Section  355(e) of the Code,  then the
Company has agreed to indemnify  IMS Health and each member of the  consolidated
group of which IMS Health is a member from and against any liability,  including
any taxes,  interest or penalties or additions to tax,  that is imposed upon IMS
Health or any member of its consolidated group as a result of the exchange offer
becoming  taxable under Section 355 of the Code. The Company will be entitled to
rely upon certain representations made by IMS Health to McDermott,  Will & Emery
in connection  with its tax opinion.  In the event any of these  representations
are not  true,  correct  or  complete,  the  Company  will not be  obligated  to
indemnify  IMS  Health or the  members of its  consolidated  group  against  any
liability  arising under  Section 355 of the Code if the  Company's  breach of a
representation  would not have resulted in this type of liability had all of IMS
Health's  representations made in connection with McDermott,  Will & Emery's tax
opinion been true, complete and correct.

     As a  result  of the  representations  made to  McDermott,  Will & Emery in
connection with its tax opinion and the covenants in the Distribution Agreement,
the acquisition of control of the Company during the two-year  period  following
the exchange  offer may be more difficult or less likely to occur because of the
potential   indemnification   liability   associated  with  a  breach  of  these
representations  or covenants.  In addition,  the Company's ability to undertake
acquisitions and other  transactions may be substantially  restricted during the
two-year period following the exchange offer.

     OTHER RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS

     In  December   2001,  the  Company  paid  IMS  Health  a  one-time  fee  of
approximately  $825,000  under an  alliance  agreement  in which the Company was
named "vendor of choice" for




IT  services to the  pharmaceutical  industry.  This  agreement  was  negotiated
between the parties on an arms-length basis.

     In addition,  the Company has a strategic  business  relationship  with The
TriZetto  Group Inc. that includes  helping its healthcare  customers  integrate
TriZetto's  products  with  their  existing   information  systems  and,  within
TriZetto,  supporting further development of these software applications.  As of
December  31,  2002,  IMS Health owned  approximately  26.4% of the  outstanding
common  stock of  Trizetto.  During  2002 the  Company  recorded  revenues  from
TriZetto  of  approximately  $2.6  million  and  expenses  related  to  TriZetto
commissions and marketing fees of  approximately  $0.7 million.  During 2001 the
Company recorded  revenues from TriZetto of approximately  $401,000 and payments
related  to  TriZetto  commissions  and  marketing  fees of  approximately  $1.0
million.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

     The  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  Company's   Canadian  and  European
subsidiaries  are  translated  into U.S.  dollars at current  exchange rates and
revenues and expenses are  translated at average  monthly  exchange  rates.  The
resulting  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  in a separate  component  of
stockholders'  equity.  For the  Company's  Indian  subsidiary,  the  functional
currency is the U.S.  dollar  since its sales are made  primarily  in the United
States,  the sales price is predominantly in U.S.  dollars;  and there is a high
volume of  intercompany  transactions  denominated in U.S.  dollars  between the
Indian  subsidiary and the Company's U.S.  affiliates.  Non-monetary  assets and
liabilities are translated at historical  exchange rates,  while monetary assets
and  liabilities  are  translated at current  exchange  rates.  A portion of the
Company's  costs in India are  denominated  in local  currency  and  subject  to
exchange  fluctuations,  which has not had any material  effect on the Company's
results of operations.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

     The Company's most significant  costs are the salaries and related benefits
for its programming  staff and other  professionals.  Competition in India,  the
United  States and Europe  for  professionals  with  advanced  technical  skills
necessary  to perform the  services  offered by the Company have caused wages to
increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation.  As with other IT
service  providers,  the Company  must  adequately  anticipate  wage  increases,
particularly  on its fixed-price  contracts.  There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to recover cost increases  through  increases in the prices
that it charges for its services in the United States and elsewhere.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     During 2002 and 2001, various accounting  pronouncements  were issued which
may impact the Company's financial  statements.  (See Note 2 to the Consolidated

facilities, its customers and suppliers,  financial markets and general economic
conditions;  (xiii)  the  effects,   domestically  and/or  internationally,   on
Cognizant, its personnel and facilities, its customers and suppliers,  financial
markets and general economic  conditions arising from hostilities  involving the
United States in Iraq or elsewhere; (xiv) a




breach of the  Distribution  agreement  entered into between the Company and IMS
Health;  (xv) a change  in the  Company's  intent  to  repatriate  undistributed
earnings and (xvi) general economic conditions.  Such forward-looking statements
include risks and uncertainties;  consequently,  actual transactions and results
may differ materially from those expressed or implied thereby.


ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company  believes that it does not have operations  subject to material
risks of foreign  currency  fluctuations,  nor does it use derivative  financial
instruments in its operations or investment portfolio.  Nonetheless, the Company
periodically evaluates the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of
foreign  currency  fluctuations.  The Company  believes that it is does not have
exposure to material market risks  associated with changes in interest rates, as
they have no variable  interest  rate debt  outstanding.  The  Company  does not
believe that it has any other material  exposure to market risks associated with
interest rates.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation:

     In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of financial
position, and the related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'
equity and cash flows present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial
position of Cognizant Technology  Solutions  Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2002 and the results of their  operations  and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended  December 31,  2002,  in  conformity
with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition,  in our opinion,  the financial statement schedule presents fairly,
in all  material  respects,  the  information  set  forth  therein  when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  These financial
statements  and  financial  statement  schedule  are the  responsibility  of the
Company's  management;  our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial  statements and financial  statement  schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these  statements in accordance with auditing  standards
generally  accepted in the United States of America,  which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company",  "Cognizant", or
"CTS") is a leading provider of custom IT design,  development,  integration and
maintenance  services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in the United
States  and  Europe.   Cognizant's   core   competencies   include   web-centric
applications,  data  warehousing,  component-based  development  and  legacy and
client-server  systems.  Cognizant  provides  the IT services it offers using an
integrated   on-site/offshore  business  model.  This  seamless  onsite/offshore
business model combines  technical and account  management teams located on-site
at the customer location and offshore at dedicated  development  centers located
in India and Ireland.

     Cognizant  began its IT development and  maintenance  services  business in
early  1994,  as  an  in-house  technology  development  center  for  The  Dun &
Bradstreet  Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, Cognizant,  along with
certain other  entities,  was spun-off from the Dun & Bradstreet  Corporation to
form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, Cognizant completed
its initial public offering of its Class A common stock (the "IPO"). On June 30,
1998, a majority interest in Cognizant, and certain other entities were spun-off
from Cognizant  Corporation  to form IMS Health  Incorporated  (""IMS  Health").
Subsequently,   Cognizant   Corporation  was  renamed  Nielsen  Media  Research,
Incorporated.

     On February 11, 2000, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split
of Class A and Class B common stock effected by a 100% dividend payable on March
16, 2000 to  stockholders  of record on March 2, 2000.  The stock split has been
reflected  in  the  accompanying   financial  statements,   and  all  applicable
references to the number of outstanding  common shares and per share information
has been restated.  Appropriate adjustments have been made in the exercise price
and number of shares subject to stock options. Stockholders' equity account have
been  restated to reflect  the  reclassification  of an amount  equal to the par
value of the increase in issued  common shares from the capital in excess of par
value account to the common stock accounts.

     At December 31, 2002,  IMS Health owned 55.3% of the  outstanding  stock of
Cognizant  (representing all of Cognizant's Class B common stock) and held 92.5%
of the combined voting power of Cognizant's common stock. Holders of Cognizant's
Class A common stock have one vote per share and holders of Cognizant's  Class B
common stock have ten votes per share.

     On January 30, 2003,  the Company  filed a tender offer in which IMS Health
stockholders could exchange IMS Health shares held by them for Cognizant Class B
common  stock  held by IMS  Health.  There  will be no impact  on the  number of
Cognizant's total shares  outstanding upon the completion of the exchange offer.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  The consolidated  financial statements reflect the
consolidated  financial  position,  results of operations  and cash flows of the
Company and its  consolidated  subsidiaries  as if it were a separate entity for
all periods presented. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash and cash equivalents primarily include time and
demand deposits in the Company's operating bank accounts.  The Company considers
all highly liquid  instruments  with an initial maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS.  The Company maintains  allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated  losses  resulting from the inability of its customers to
make required  payments.  The  allowance for doubtful  accounts is determined by
evaluating  the relative  credit-worthiness  of each customer  based upon market
capitalization and other information, including the aging of the receivables.

INVESTMENTS. Investments in business entities in which the Company does not have
control or the ability to exercise significant  influence over the operating and
financial  policies are  accounted  for under the cost method.  Investments  are
evaluated for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant.

PROPERTY  AND  EQUIPMENT.  Property  and  equipment  are stated at cost,  net of
accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis
over the  estimated  useful  lives of the  assets.  Leasehold  improvements  are
amortized on a straight-line  basis over the shorter of the term of the lease or
the  estimated  useful  life of the  improvement.  Maintenance  and  repairs are
expensed as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized.

PURCHASED  SOFTWARE.  Purchased  software  that is intended  for internal use is
capitalized,  including the salaries and benefits of employees that are directly
involved  in the  installation  of such  software.  The  capitalized  costs  are
amortized on a straight-line method over the lesser of three years or its useful
life.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES.  Goodwill  represents the excess of the purchase
price of the former minority  interest in the Company's  Indian  subsidiary over
the fair  values of amounts  assigned to the net assets  acquired.  Amortization
expense had been recorded using the straight-line  method over a period of seven
years.  Amortization  expense was $317 for each of the years ended  December 31,
2001 and 2000.  Accumulated  amortization  was $1,345 and $1,028 at December 31,
2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Effective  January 1, 2002,  in  accordance  with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other
Intangible  Assets"  ("FAS  142"),  the  Company  is no  longer  amortizing  its
remaining  goodwill  balance;  however,  the Company does evaluate  goodwill for
impairment,  in accordance with FAS 142, at least annually,  or as circumstances
warrant.

                                      F-8



                   COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (in thousands, except share and per share data)


     Other intangibles represent primarily customer  relationships and assembled
workforce,  which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years and
5-8 years,  respectively.  The Company evaluates such intangibles for impairment
in accordance with FAS 142, at each balance sheet date

LONG-LIVED  ASSETS.  In  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting
Standards  ("SFAS")  No.  144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of
Long-Lived  Assets",  which  was  adopted  in  2002,  the  Company  reviews  for
impairment  long-lived  assets and  certain  identifiable  intangibles  whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be  recoverable.  In general,  the Company will  recognize an impairment
loss when the sum of  undiscounted  expected  future cash flows is less than the
carrying  amount of such assets.  The measurement for such an impairment loss is
then based on the fair value of the asset.

REVENUE  RECOGNITION.  The  Company's  services  are  entered  into on  either a
time-and-materials  or fixed-price basis.  Revenues related to time-and-material
contracts  are  recognized  as the  service is  performed.  Revenues  related to
fixed-price  contracts  that provide for highly complex  information  technology
application   development   services  or  that  provide  for  a  combination  of
application  development and application  maintenance services are recognized as
the  service  is  performed   using  the   percentage-of-completion   method  of
accounting,  under which the sales value of  performance  is  recognized  on the
basis of the  percentage  that each  contract's  cost to date bears to the total
estimated cost.  Revenues related to fixed-priced  contracts that provide solely
for application  maintenance services are recognized on a straight-line basis or
as  services  are  rendered  or   transactions   processed  in  accordance  with
contractual terms. Expenses are recorded as incurred over the contract period.

     Fixed-priced  contracts  are  cancellable  subject  to a  specified  notice
period.  All services  provided by the Company  through the date of cancellation
are due and  payable  under the  contract  terms.  The Company  issues  invoices
related to fixed price contracts based upon  achievement of milestones  during a
project or other contractual terms.  Differences between the timing of billings,
based upon contract  milestones or other contractual  terms, and the recognition
of revenue, based upon the  percentage-of-completion  method of accounting,  are
recognized as either  unbilled or deferred  revenue.  Estimates of certain fixed
contracts are subject to adjustment as a project  progresses to reflect  changes
in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates
is reflected in the financial  reporting  period in which the change in estimate
becomes  known  and  any   anticipated   losses  on  contracts  are   recognized
immediately.  A reserve for  warranty  provisions  under such  contracts,  which
generally  exist for ninety days past  contract  completion,  is  estimated  and
accrued during the contract period.

     Revenues related to services  performed  without a signed agreement or work
order are not recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement, such as when
agreements  or work orders are signed or payment is  received;  however the cost
related to the performance of such work is recognized in the period the services
are  rendered.  Such  revenue  is  recognized  when,  and  if,  evidence  of  an
arrangement is obtained.

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED  EMPLOYEE  COMPENSATION  PLANS. At December 31, 2002,
the  Company  has  four  stock-based  employee  compensation  plans,  which  are
described  more fully in Note 8. The company  accounts for those plans under the
recognition  and measurement  principles of APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations." No stock-based employee
compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those
plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the  underlying  common
stock on the date of grant.  The following  table  illustrates the effect on net
income  and  earnings  per  share if the  Company  had  applied  the fair  value
recognition  provisions of FASB Statement No. 123,  "Accounting  for Stock-Based
Compensation", to stock-based employee compensation.

                                                              December 31,

  Pro forma- diluted..............................    $1.08     $0.74     $0.63


UNBILLED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenues on
contracts  to be  billed,  in  subsequent  periods,  as  per  the  terms  of the
contracts.

FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.  The assets  and  liabilities  of the  Company's
Canadian and European  subsidiaries  are translated into U.S. dollars from local
currencies at current  exchange  rates and revenues and expenses are  translated
from  local   currencies  at  average  monthly  exchange  rates.  The  resulting
translation  adjustments are recorded in a separate  component of  stockholders'
equity.  For the Company's  Indian  subsidiary  ("CTS  India"),  the  functional
currency is the U.S.  dollar,  since its sales are made  primarily in the United
States,  the sales price is  predominantly  in U.S.  dollars and there is a high
volume of  intercompany  transactions  denominated in U.S.  dollars  between CTS
India  and  its  U.S.  affiliates.   Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are
translated at historical  exchange rates,  while monetary assets and liabilities
are translated at current  exchange rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included
in other income.

                (in thousands, except share and per share data)


USE OF ESTIMATES.  The  preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with
generally  accepted   accounting   principles  in  the  United  States  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities,  including the recoverability of tangible and intangible
assets,  disclosure of contingent  assets and  liabilities as of the date of the
financial  statements,  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reported period. The most significant  estimates relate to the allowance for
doubtful  accounts,  reserve for  warranties,  reserves for  employee  benefits,
depreciation of fixed assets and long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation
and the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion
method of accounting for applicable fixed-bid contracts,  income tax expense and
related deferred assets and liabilities,  and purchase price allocation  related
to  intangible  and  tangible  assets  acquired.  Results  could  vary  from the
estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the accompanying  financial
statements.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

     All of the Company's software development centers,  including a substantial
majority of its employees are located in India. As a result,  the Company may be
subject to certain risks  associated with  international  operations,  including
risks  associated with foreign  currency  exchange rate  fluctuations  and risks
associated  with the  application  and imposition of protective  legislation and
regulations  relating to import and export or otherwise  resulting  from foreign
policy or the variability of foreign economic  conditions.  To date, the Company
has not engaged in any  significant  hedging  transactions to mitigate its risks
relating  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  Additional  risks  associated  with
international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property
rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws,  potential
geo-political and other risks associated with terrorist  activities and local or
cross border conflicts,  potentially adverse tax consequences,  tariffs,  quotas
and other barriers.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to significant  concentrations  of credit risk consist primarily of cash
and cash equivalents and trade accounts  receivable.  The Company  maintains its
cash   investments   with  high  credit  quality   financial   institutions   in
investment-grade,  short-term  debt  securities  and limits the amount of credit
exposure to any one commercial issuer.

INCOME TAXES.

     The Company  provides for income taxes  utilizing  the asset and  liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method,  deferred income taxes
are  recorded to reflect the tax  consequences  in future  years of  differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and their  financial  reporting
amounts at each balance sheet date,  based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax
rates  applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income.  If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future
tax  benefits  associated  with a  deferred  tax asset will not be  realized,  a
valuation  allowance  is  provided.  The  effect  on  deferred  tax  assets  and
liabilities  of a change in the tax rates is  recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

                (in thousands, except share and per share data)


     CTS India is an export-oriented  company, which under the Indian Income Tax
Act of 1961,  is  entitled to claim a tax holiday for a period of ten years with
respect  to  its  export  profits.  Substantially  all of  the  earnings  of the
Company's Indian subsidiary are attributable to export profits and are therefore
currently entitled to a 90% exemption from Indian income tax. These tax holidays
will begin to expire in 2004 and under current law will be completely phased out
by 2009.  In  prior  periods,  it was  management's  intent  to  repatriate  all
accumulated earnings from India to the United States;  accordingly,  the Company
has provided deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $24,935 on all
such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001.

     During the first quarter of 2002, the Company made a strategic  decision to
pursue  an  international   strategy  that  includes   expanded   infrastructure
investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component
of this strategy,  the Company intends to use 2002 and future Indian earnings to
expand  operations  outside of the United States instead of  repatriating  these
earnings to the United States. Accordingly,  effective January 1, 2002, pursuant
to Accounting  Principles  Bulletin 23, the Company has not accrued taxes on the
repatriation of earnings  recognized in 2002 as these earnings are considered to
be  indefinitely  reinvested  outside of the United  States.  As of December 31,
2002, the amount of unrepatriated  earnings upon which no provision for taxation
has been recorded is approximately  $30,059. If such earnings are repatriated in
the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely  reinvested,  the Company
would accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings.  This
change in  intent,  as well as a change in the  second  quarter in the manner in
which  repatriated  earnings  are  taxed  in  India,  resulted  in an  estimated
effective  tax rate for the year ended  December  31,  2002 of 23.4%.  This rate
compares to an effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000
of 37.4%.

     Deferred  U.S.  income  taxes on  unremitted  earnings  from other  foreign
entities have not been  provided for as it is the  Company's  intent to reinvest
such earnings. Such income taxes are immaterial.

NET INCOME PER SHARE.  Basic earnings per share ("EPS") excludes dilution and is
computed  by  dividing  earnings   available  to  common   stockholders  by  the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
includes all  potential  dilutive  common stock in the weighted  average  shares
outstanding.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.  Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the 2002 presentation.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED:

     In  June  2001,  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  141,
"Business  Combinations"  ("FAS  141") and  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 142  "Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets"  ("FAS  142") were
issued.  FAS 141 requires the purchase  method of  accounting to be used for all
business combinations initiated after June 30,

                                      F-12

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (in thousands, except share and per share data)


2001. FAS 141 also specifies  criteria that intangible assets acquired must meet
to be recognized and reported  separately  from goodwill.  FAS 142 requires that
goodwill and intangible  assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but
instead be measured for impairment at least  annually,  or when events  indicate
that there may be an  impairment.  At December 31, 2002,  the Company  evaluated
both  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  and  concluded  that  they had not been
impaired.  FAS 142 is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15,
2001. The adoption of FAS 141 and FAS 142 did not have a material  effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

     The  following  table sets  forth the  Company's  results  had FAS 142 been
applied to the prior-period financial statements presented herein.

     In August 2001,  Statement of Financial Standards No. 144,  "Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets" ("FAS 144") was issued. FAS 144
supersedes  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for
the  Impairment of Long-lived  Assets to be Disposed of," and the accounting and
reporting   provisions  of  APB  Opinion  No.  30,  "Reporting  the  Results  of
Operations-Reporting  the Effects of  Disposal  of a Segment of a Business,  and
Extraordinary,  Unusual and Infrequently occurring Events and Transactions." FAS
144 also  amends ARB  ("Accounting  Research  Bulletins")  No. 51,  Consolidated
Financial  Statements,  to  eliminate  the  exception  to  consolidation  for  a
subsidiary  for which  control is likely to be  temporary.  FAS 144  retains the
fundamental  provisions  of FAS 121 for  recognizing  and  measuring  impairment
losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of
by sale, while resolving  significant  implementation issues associated with FAS
121. Among other things, FAS 144 provides guidance on how long-lived assets used
as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment,  establishes criteria for
when  long-lived  assets are held for sale,  and  prescribes  the accounting for
long-lived  assets  that  will be  disposed  of other  than by sale.  FAS 144 is
effective for fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 2001. The adoption of
FAS 144 did not have a material impact on the Company's  financial  position and
results of operations.

     In April  2002,  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  145,
"Rescission of FASB  Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64,  Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 13, and  Technical  Corrections"  ("FAS 145") was issued.  FAS 145  updates,

2002.  The  adoption  of this  statement  did not have a material  impact on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

     In December  2002,  Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 148
"Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation  -  Transition  and  Disclosure - an
amendment of FAS 123" (FAS 148) was issued. FAS 148 amends FAS 123,  "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation",  to provide alternative methods of transition for
a voluntary  change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation.  In addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure  requirements
of FAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee  compensation
and the effect of the method used on reported  results.  The Company has adopted
these amended disclosure  requirements (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements) under the heading  "Accounting for Stock Based  Compensation  Plans"
and will  implement  the  required  interim  disclosures  beginning in the first
quarter of 2003.

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted:

     In  June  2001,  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  143,
"Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations"  ("FAS 143") was issued.  FAS 143
addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for legal obligations  associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated  retirement
costs that result from the acquisition,  construction, or development and normal
operation of a long-lived asset. Upon initial  recognition of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation, FAS 143 requires an increase in the carrying amount
of the related  long-lived  asset.  The asset  retirement  cost is  subsequently
allocated  to expense  using a systematic  and  rational  method over the assets
useful life.  FAS 143 is effective  for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,
2002. The adoption of this  statement is not expected to have a material  impact
on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

     In  June  2002,  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  146,
"Accounting  for Exit or Disposal  Activities"  ("FAS 146") was issued.  FAS 146
addresses the accounting for costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital
lease, costs to consolidate  facilities and relocate employees,  and involuntary
termination benefits under one-time benefit arrangements that are not an ongoing
benefit program or an individual deferred compensation contract. A liability for
contract  termination  costs  should be  recognized  and  measured at fair value
either when the  contract  is  terminated  or when the entity  ceases to use the
right conveyed by the contract.  A liability for one-time  termination  benefits
should be recognized and measured at fair value at the communication date if the
employee would not be retained beyond a minimum retention period (i.e., either a
legal  notification  period or 60 days,  if no legal  requirement  exists).  For
employees that will be retained beyond the minimum retention period, a liability
should be accrued ratably over the future service period.  The provisions of the
statement will be effective for disposal activities initiated after December 31,
2002. The adoption of this  statement is not expected to have a material  impact
on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

     In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus
in EITF 00-21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables".  The consensus,
which is effective for contracts  entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2003,  requires that a Company should  evaluate all  deliverables in an
arrangement to determine  whether they  represent  separate units of accounting.
That  evaluation  must be performed at the inception of the  arrangement  and as
each item in the arrangement is delivered.  Arrangement  consideration should be
then allocated  among the separate  units of accounting  based on their relative
fair values.  EITF 00-21  indicates  that the best evidence of fair value is the
price of a deliverable  when it is regularly  sold on a standalone  basis.  Fair
value evidence often consists of entity-specific  or  vendor-specific  objective
evidence (VSOE) of fair value.

     The Company  enters into  contracts  that could be considered  arrangements
with multiple  deliverables.  These contracts are primarily  long-term fixed-bid
contracts that provide both application  maintenance and application development
services. As indicated in Note 2 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements,  the
Company accounts for such contracts using  percentage of completion  accounting,
which is the prevailing industry practice.  The Company is currently  evaluating
the  possible  prospective  impact of EITF  00-21 on the  Company's  results  of
operations related to contracts entered into after June 15, 2003.

4. INVESTMENTS

     On June 30, 2002,  Cognizant  Technology  Solutions  Ireland  Limited ("CTS
Ireland"),  a newly formed  wholly owned  subsidiary  of the Company,  purchased
certain assets and assumed certain  liabilities  from  UnitedHealthcare  Ireland
Limited  ("UHCI"),  a subsidiary of UnitedHealth  Group,  for $3,043  (including
approximately  $143 of direct deal  costs).  In  accordance  with FAS 142,  this
transaction  was  determined  to be an  acquisition  of  assets,  not a business
combination.

     UHCI previously provided, and will continue to provide through CTS Ireland,
application  development and maintenance  services,  using the existing staff of
approximately 70 software professionals.  The acquisition of the assets of UHCI,
is  designed  to enable the  Company to provide a wide range of  services to the
Company's   clients  in  Europe  and  worldwide  and   represents   the  initial
implementation of the Company's  previously  announced  international  expansion
strategy.

     In  accordance  with FAS 142,  the  Company  has  allocated,  based upon an
independent  appraisal,  the purchase  price to the UHCI tangible and intangible
assets  and  liabilities  acquired.  The  details  of  the  allocation  and  the
respective useful lives over which these assets are being amortized are provided
in the table below.  Amortization  of $148,  related to the acquisition of these
assets,  has been included in the Consolidated  Statements of Operations for the
six-month  period ended December 31, 2002.  Such net assets,  excluding  amounts
assigned  to fixed  assets,  have  been  included  as  intangible  assets in the
Consolidated  Balance Sheets and as identifiable  assets in the European segment
in Note 12. The  operating  results of CTS  Ireland  have been  included  in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company effective July 1, 2002.

     On October 29,  2002,  the Company  completed  the  transfer of  Silverline
Technologies,  Inc.'s ("Silverline")  practice, which serviced a major financial
services  company to the Company for $10,424  (including  approximately  $620 of
direct deal costs).  In accordance with FAS 142, this transaction was determined
to be an acquisition of assets, not a business combination.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (in thousands, except share and per share data)

     Under the terms of the  transfer,  the  Company  will  provide  application
design,  development and maintenance  services to such major financial  services
company  through an  acquired  workforce  of  approximately  300 IT and  support
professionals located primarily in the United States and India.  Amortization of
$178,  related to the  acquisition  of these  assets,  has been  included in the
Consolidated  Statements of Operations  for the two-month  period ended December
31,  2002.  Such net  assets  have been  included  as  intangible  assets in the
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets and as  identifiable  assets in the North American
segment in Note 12.

     Since the transfer was effected on October 29, 2002, the operating  results
of this transfer have been included in the consolidated  financial statements of
the Company commencing from that date.

     The  operating  results of UHCI and  Silverline,  for the periods  included
indicated above, were not material to the consolidated  operating results of the
Company for the year ended December 31, 2002.

         The purchase price for UHCI and Silverline's financial services company
practice was allocated to the following tangible and intangibles assets and is
being amortized over the useful lives indicated below:


                             UHCI       Useful Life   Silverline    Useful Life
                             ----       -----------   ----------    -----------

(Incl. Deal costs)          -----                       --------


     The estimated aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets for each
of the succeeding five fiscal years is; 2003 through 2006: $1,362, 2007: $1,342.

     In June 2000, the Company  announced a strategic  relationship with Trident
Capital,  a  leading  venture  capital  firm,  to  jointly  invest  in  emerging
e-business service and technology  companies.  In accordance with this strategy,
the Company invested $1,955 in Questra  Corporation  ("Questra"),  an e-business
software and consulting firm headquartered in Rochester, New York, in return for
a 5.8%  equity  interest.  Trident  Capital  also  independently  made a  direct
investment in Questra. The Company's investment is being accounted for under the
cost basis of accounting.

     The Company  reviews  for  impairment  certain  assets  whenever  events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Questra issued Preferred B shares
in exchange for $19 million of new venture capital financing.  Since the Company
did not  participate,  its ownership  interest in Preferred A shares was reduced
from 5.8% to 2.1%.  Based on the implied  fair value of Questra,  as measured by
the latest round of financing,  and  considering  the  preferential  liquidation
rights that the  Preferred B  shareholders  received,  the Company has concluded
that it will  not  recover  its  investment  in  Questra  and  has  recorded  an
impairment loss of $1,955 to recognize the other than temporary decline in value
of its investment.

5. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

     Beginning in 1997,  certain U.S.  employees of the Company were eligible to
participate  in Cognizant  Corporation's  and now IMS Health's  401(k) plan. The
Company matches up to 50.0% of the eligible employee's contribution.  The amount
charged to expense for the Company's  matching  contribution was $0, $0, and $31
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2000, the
Company  established a 401(k) plan, which certain U.S.  employees of the Company
became  eligible  to  participate  in.  The  Company  matches up to 50.0% of the
eligible employee's contribution. The amount charged to expense for the matching
contribution was $479, $351 and $195 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

     Certain of the  Company's  employees  participate  in IMS Health's  defined
benefit pension plan and a defined  contribution  plan in the United Kingdom and
Ireland  sponsored  by the  Company.  The  costs to the  Company  recognized  as
postretirement  benefit costs and related  liabilities  were not material to the
Company's  results of operations or financial  position for the years presented.
(See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

     CTS India maintains an employee benefit plan that covers  substantially all
India-based employees. The employees' provident fund, pension and family pension
plans are statutory defined  contribution  retirement  benefit plans.  Under the
plans,  employees  contribute up to twelve  percent of their base  compensation,
which is matched by an equal  contribution  by CTS India.  Contribution  expense
recognized was $928,  $790, and $501 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

     CTS India also  maintains  a  statutory  gratuity  plan that is a statutory
postemployment benefit plan providing defined lump sum benefits. CTS India makes
annual   contributions  to  an  employees'  gratuity  fund  established  with  a
government-owned  insurance  corporation  to  fund a  portion  of the  estimated
obligation.  The Company  estimates its obligation based upon employees'  salary
and years of service. Expense recognized by the Company was $752, $902, and $511
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Cognizant  has  generated  net  operating  losses for U.S.  tax purposes of
approximately  $8.6 million.  These losses have an  expiration  date for Federal
purposes through 12/31/22. For state purposes, the date of expiration varies but
will generally be less than the Federal expiration period.

     Cognizant's  Indian subsidiary,  CTS India, is an export-oriented  company,
which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays
for a period of ten years with respect to its export profits.  Substantially all
of the  earnings  of CTS  India  are  attributable  to  export  profits  and are
therefore  currently  entitled to a 90% exemption  from Indian income tax. These
tax  holidays  will  begin to  expire  in 2004  and  under  current  law will be
completely  phased  out by  March of 2009.  Prior to 2002,  it was  management's
intent to repatriate all  accumulated  earnings from India to the United States;
accordingly,  Cognizant  has  provided  deferred  income  taxes in the amount of
approximately  $24,935 on all such  undistributed  earnings through December 31,
2001. During the first quarter of 2002,  Cognizant made a strategic  decision to
pursue  an  international   strategy  that  includes   expanded   infrastructure
investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component
of this strategy,  Cognizant  intends to use 2002 and future Indian  earnings to
expand  operations  outside of the United States instead of  repatriating  these
earnings to the United States. Accordingly,  effective January 1, 2002, pursuant
to Accounting  Principles  Bulletin 23, Cognizant will no longer accrue taxes on
the repatriation of earnings  recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these
earnings are  considered  to be  indefinitely  reinvested  outside of the United
States. As of December 31, 2002, the amount of unrepatriated earnings upon which
no provision for taxation has been recorded is  approximately  $30,059.  If such
earnings  are  repatriated  in  the  future,  or  are  no  longer  deemed  to be
indefinitely  reinvested,  Cognizant will accrue the applicable  amount of taxes
associated with such earnings. Due to the various methods by which such earnings
could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine
the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (in thousands, except share and per share data)

     This  change  in  intent,  as well  as a  change  in the  manner  in  which
repatriated earnings are taxed in India,  resulted in an estimated effective tax
rate for the year ended  December  31, 2002 of 23.4%.  This rate  compares to an
effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 37.4%.

     Deferred  U.S.  income  taxes on  unremitted  earnings  from other  foreign
entities have not been  provided for as it is the  Company's  intent to reinvest
such earnings. Such income taxes are immaterial.

7. CAPITAL STOCK

     On June 24,  1998,  the Company  consummated  its Initial  Public  Offering
("IPO") of 5,834,000  shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $5.00 per
share (on a  post-split  basis),  5,000,000 of which were issued and sold by the
Company and 834,000 of which were sold by Cognizant  Corporation,  the Company's
then majority  owner and  controlling  parent  company.  The net proceeds to the
Company from the IPO were  approximately  $22,407 after $843 of direct expenses.
In July 1998,  IMS Health (the  accounting  successor to Cognizant  Corporation)
sold 875,100  shares of Class B common  stock,  which were  converted to Class A
common stock pursuant to an over allotment option granted to the underwriters of
the IPO. Of the total net proceeds received by the Company upon the consummation
of its IPO,  approximately  $6,637 was used to repay the related  party  balance
then owed to Cognizant  Corporation.  The related  party  balance  resulted from
certain advances to the Company from Cognizant  Corporation used to purchase the
minority  interest of the Company's  Indian  subsidiary  and to fund payroll and
accounts payable.  Concurrent with the IPO, the Company reclassified the amounts
in mandatorily redeemable common stock to stockholders' equity as the redemption
feature was voided.

     On June 12,  1998,  the Company  amended and restated  its  certificate  of
incorporation to authorize 100,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value
$.01 per share,  15,000,000  shares of Class B common stock,  par value $.01 per
share,  and 15,000,000  shares of preferred stock, par value $.10 per share, and
effected a 0.65 for one reverse  stock  split.  Holders of Class A common  stock
have one vote per share and  holders of Class B common  stock have ten votes per
share. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to convert their shares into
Class A common stock at any time on a share for share  basis.  Shares of Class B
Common Stock transferred to stockholders of IMS Health in a transaction intended
to be on a tax-free  basis (a "Tax-Free  Spin-Off")  under the Internal  Revenue
Code of 1986,  as amended  shall not  convert to shares of Class A Common  Stock
upon the occurrence of such Tax-Free Spin-Off.  (See Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements). No preferred stock has been issued.

     On February 11, 2000, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split
of Class A and Class B Common Stock effected by a 100% dividend payable on March
16, 2000 to  stockholders  of record on March 2, 2000.  The stock split has been
reflected in the  financial  statements,  and all  applicable  references to the
number of outstanding common shares and per share information has been restated.
Appropriate  adjustments  have been  made in the  exercise  price and  number of
shares subject to stock options. Stockholders' equity account has been

restated to reflect the  reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of
the  increase  in issued  common  shares from the capital in excess of par value
account to the common stock accounts.

     On May 23, 2000, the  stockholders  of the Company  approved an increase in
the  number  of  authorized  Class B common  Stock  from  15,000,000  shares  to
25,000,000 shares.

     At December 31, 2002,  IMS Health owned 55.3% of the  outstanding  stock of
Cognizant  (representing all of Cognizant's Class B common stock) and held 92.5%
of the combined voting power of Cognizant's common stock. Holders of Cognizant's
Class A common stock have one vote per share and holders of Cognizant's  Class B
common  stock  have  ten  votes  per  share.  (See  Note 13 to the  Consolidated
Financial Statements).

     On January 30, 2003,  the Company  filed a tender offer in which IMS Health
shareholders could exchange IMS Health shares held by them for Cognizant Class B
common  stock  held by IMS  Health.  There  will be no impact  on the  number of
Cognizant's total shares  outstanding upon the completion of the exchange offer.
As a direct  result of the IMS Health  exchange  offer,  Cognizant  has incurred
charges in the  fourth  quarter  of 2002 of $1.7  million  related to direct and
incremental legal, accounting, printing and other costs.


8. EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

     In July 1997, CTS adopted a Key Employees Stock Option Plan, which provides
for the grant of up to 1,397,500 stock options (each option exercisable into one
(1) share of the Company's Class A common stock) to eligible employees.  Options
granted  under this plan may not be granted at an exercise  price less than fair
market value of the underlying  shares on the date of grant.  As a result of the
IPO, all options have a life of ten years, vest  proportionally  over four years
and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on
the grant date.

     In December 1997, CTS adopted a Non-Employee  Directors' Stock Option Plan,
which  provides  for the  grant of up to  143,000  stock  options  (each  option
exercisable  into  one (1)  share  of the  Class A  common  stock)  to  eligible
directors.  Options  granted under this  Company's plan may not be granted at an
exercise price less than fair market value of the underlying  shares on the date
of grant.  As a result of the IPO,  all options  have a life of ten years,  vest
proportionally  over two  years  and have an  exercise  price  equal to the fair
market value of the common stock on the grant date.

     In March  1998,  CTS  granted  non-qualified  stock  options to purchase an
aggregate of 97,500  shares of Class A common stock to CTS's  Chairman and Chief
Executive  Officer at an exercise price of $13.84 per share, an amount less than
the then fair market  value of the  underlying  shares on the date of the grant.
The  Company has  recorded  the related  compensation  expense  over the vesting
period of these options.

     In May 1999,  CTS  adopted  the 1999  Incentive  Compensation  Plan,  which
provides for the grant of up to 2,000,000 stock options (each option exercisable
into one (1) share of the

Company's Class A common stock) to eligible employees, nonemployee Directors and
independent  contractors.  Options granted under this plan may not be granted at
an exercise  price less than fair market value of the  underlying  shares on the
date of grant. All options have a life of ten years,  vest  proportionally  over
four years, unless specified otherwise,  and have an exercise price equal to the
fair market  value of the common stock on the grant date.  On May 23, 2000,  the
stockholders  of the  Company  approved  an  increase  in the  number  of shares
available for issuance  under this plan from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000  shares.  On
May 30, 2001, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase in the number
of shares available for issuance under this plan from 3,000,000 to 6,000,000.

     In May 1999,  CTS adopted the Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan (the "Purchase
Plan"),  which  provides for the issuance of up to 800,000 shares of CTS Class A
common  stock to eligible  employees.  The Purchase  Plan  provides for eligible
employees to designate in advance of specified  purchase periods a percentage of
compensation  to be withheld  from their pay and applied  toward the purchase of
such number of whole  shares of Class A common  stock as can be  purchased  at a
price of 85% of the  lesser of (a) the fair  market  value of a share of Class A
common  stock on the first date of the purchase  period;  or (b) the fair market
value  of a share of Class A  common  stock  on the  last  date of the  purchase
period. No employee can purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock annually,  and
no stock can be  purchased  by any person  which would  result in the  purchaser
owning  more than five  percent or more of the total  combined  voting  power or
value of all  classes of stock of the  Company.  In  accordance  with APB 25, no
compensation  expense was recorded in connection  with the purchase of shares by
employees.

     During the year ended  December 31, 2002,  approximately  28,000  shares of
Class A common stock were  purchased by employees  under the Purchase  Plan.  At
December 31, 2002,  there were  approximate  708,605 shares available for future
issuance under the Purchase Plan.

     A summary of the Company's stock option activity,  and related  information
is as follows as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000:

         At December 31, 2002, 1,727,431 options(each option exercisable into
one (1) share of the Company's Class A common stock) were available for future
issuance under the Company's option plans.


     The following  summarizes  information  about the  Company's  stock options
outstanding and exercisable by price range at December 31, 2002:




Compensation  cost  recognized  by the Company under APB 25 was $0, $11, and $35
for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based  compensation plans, as
well as the IMS Health options held by certain executive officers (See Note 9 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements),  been determined based on the fair value
at the grant dates for awards  under  those  plans,  consistent  with the method
prescribed  by SFAS No. 123, the  Company's  net income and net income per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

     The pro forma disclosures shown above are not representative of the effects
on net income and earnings per share in future years.

     For purposes of pro forma  disclosures only, the fair value for all Company
options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes  option model
with the following weighted average assumptions in 2002: risk-free interest rate
of  2.71%,  expected  dividend  yield of 0.0%,  expected  volatility  of 65% and
weighted  average  expected  life  of 2.9  years.  2001  assumptions;  risk-free
interest rate of 4.3%,  expected dividend yield of 0.0%,  expected volatility of
78% and weighted average expected life of 3.0 years. 2000 assumptions; risk-free
interest rate of 6.1%,  expected dividend yield of 0.0%,  expected volatility of
75% and  expected  life of 3.9  years.  The  weighted-average  fair value of the
Company's  options  granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $20.04,  $16.68,  and
$21.71, respectively.

9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

REVENUES.  The  Company  and  IMS  Health  have  entered  into  Master  Services
Agreements  pursuant  to which the Company  provides  certain IT services to IMS
Health.  The Company  recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling
$20,429  and  $18,809  in 2002 and  2001,  respectively.  In 2000,  the  Company
recognized related party revenues totaling $14,273,  including revenues from IMS
Health and Strategic Technologies, a then affiliated subsidiary, (through August
30, 2000).

AFFILIATED AGREEMENTS. In 1997, the Company entered into various agreements with
Cognizant  Corporation,  which were  assigned  to IMS Health as part of the 1998
Reorganization.  The agreements included an Intercompany  Services Agreement for
services  provided by IMS Health such as payroll and payables  processing,  tax,
real  estate  and risk  management  services,  a  License  Agreement  to use the
"Cognizant"  trade name and an  Intercompany  Agreement.  On July 1,  1998,  IMS
Health  transferred all of its rights to the "Cognizant"  name and related trade
and service marks to the Company.

SERVICES.  In 2002 and 2001,  IMS  Health  provided  the  Company  with  certain
administrative services, including payroll and payables processing and permitted
the Company to participate in IMS Health's  business  insurance  plans. In prior
periods,  IMS Health  provided  certain other  services such as tax planning and
compliance,  which have now been transitioned to the Company.  All services were
performed  under the CTS / IMS Health  intercompany  services  agreement.  Total
costs  charged to the Company by IMS Health in  connection  with these  services
were $656,  $440 and $254 for the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.

     In  December   2001,  the  Company  paid  IMS  Health  a  one-time  fee  of
approximately  $825 under an alliance  agreement  in which the Company was named
"vendor of choice" for IT services to the pharmaceutical industry.

                (in thousands, except share and per share data)


     In addition,  the Company has a certain relationship with the former Erisco
Managed Care Technologies ("Erisco"),  which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of
The Trizetto Group, Inc.

("Trizetto").  As of December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned  approximately 26.4% of
the  outstanding  common  stock of Trizetto.  During 2002 and 2001,  the Company
recorded revenues from Erisco of approximately $2,577 and $401, respectively and
payments to Erisco for commissions and marketing fees of approximately  $697 and
$1,012, respectively.

PENSION  PLANS.  Certain  U.S.  employees  of the  Company  participated  in IMS
Health's defined benefit pension plans. The plans are cash balance pension plans
under which six percent of creditable  compensation plus interest is credited to
the employee's  retirement  account on a monthly  basis.  The cash balance earns
monthly investment credits based on the 30-year Treasury bond yield. At the time
of retirement,  the vested employee's  account balance is actuarially  converted
into an  annuity.  The  Company's  cost  for  these  plans  is  included  in the
allocation of expense from IMS Health for employee benefits plans.

STOCK OPTIONS.  In November 1996, in consideration  for services to the Company,
Cognizant  Corporation  granted an executive officer and director of the Company
options to purchase an aggregate of 114,900 shares (on a pre-split basis) of the
common stock of Cognizant  Corporation at an exercise price of $33.38 per share.
Such executive officer and director agreed to forfeit options to purchase 58,334
shares (on a pre-split  basis) of  Cognizant  Corporation  common stock upon the
consummation of the Company's initial public offering.  In July 1998, IMS Health
granted an  executive  officer  options to purchase an aggregate of 8,158 shares
(on a pre-split basis) of the common stock of IMS Health at an exercise price of
$30.17 per share.  All  remaining  such options have since been  converted  into
options  to  purchase  the  common  stock  of  IMS  Health  as a  result  of the
Reorganization  that  occurred  on July 1, 1998,  the  two-for-one  split of IMS
Health stock that  occurred on January 15,  1999,  the  distribution  of Gartner
Group  shares that  occurred on July 26, 1999 and the  distribution  of Synavant
Inc. (formerly known as Strategic  Technologies)  shares that occurred on August
30, 2000. At December 31, 2002 after adjusting for the Reorganization, the split
of IMS Health's  stock and the  distribution  of Gartner Group and Synavant Inc.
shares, such officer had 172,297 options in IMS Health outstanding at a weighted
average  exercise  price of $15.96 per share.  At  December  31,  2002,  172,297
options were exercisable.

     In  November  1996,  Cognizant  Corporation  granted an  executive  officer
options to purchase an aggregate of 60,000 shares (on a pre-split  basis) of the
common stock of Cognizant  Corporation at an exercise price of $33.38 per share.
In addition,  in November 1996,  such executive  officer was granted  options to
purchase an  aggregate  of 20,000  shares (on a  pre-split  basis) of the common
stock of Cognizant  Corporation at an exercise price of $33.38 per share,  which
was equal to the fair market  value at the grant date,  by paying ten percent of
the option  exercise  price as an advance  payment  toward  such  exercise.  The
unvested portion of such advance payment is refundable under certain conditions.
The  remaining  90  percent is payable  at  exercise.  In July 1998,  IMS Health
granted an  executive  officer  options to purchase an aggregate of 9,106 shares
(on a pre-split basis) of the common stock of IMS Health at an exercise price of
$30.17 per share.  All  remaining  such options have since been  converted  into
options  to  purchase  the  common  stock  of  IMS  Health  as a  result  of the
Reorganization,  the two-for-one  split of IMS Health stock, the distribution of
Gartner Group and Synavant Inc. shares

the  split of IMS  Health's  stock and the  distribution  of  Gartner  Group and
Synavant Inc. shares, such officer had 127,379 options in IMS Health outstanding
at a weighted  average exercise price of $15.96 per share. At December 31, 2002,
127,379 options were exercisable.

10. COMMITMENTS

     As of  December  31,  2002,  the Company  has  entered  into fixed  capital
commitments  related  to its  India  development  center  expansion  program  of
approximately  $28.8  million,  of which  $19.2  million  has  been  spent as of
December 31, 2002.

     The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases, which
expire at various dates through the year 2011.  Certain leases  contain  renewal
provisions and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes,
and other  operating  expenses.  Future minimum rental  payments under operating
leases that have  initial or  remaining  lease terms in excess of one year as of
December 31, 2002 are as follows:

     2003.........................................................$5,799
     2004..........................................................3,829
     2005..........................................................2,229
     2006..........................................................1,755
     2007..........................................................1,252
     Thereafter....................................................2,090
     Total minimum lease payments................................$16,954

     Rental expense totaled  $5,201,  $3,175 and $3,472 for years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

11. CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions  arising in the
ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management,  the outcome of such
claims  and legal  actions,  if decided  adversely,  is not  expected  to have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results of operations.  Additionally,  many of the Company's engagements involve
projects  that are critical to the  operations  of its  customers'  business and
provide  benefits  that are  difficult to quantify.  Any failure in a customer's
computer  system could  result in a claim for  substantial  damages  against the
Company,  regardless of the Company's responsibility for such failure.  Although
the Company  attempts to  contractually  limit its liability for damages arising
from negligent acts,  errors,  mistakes,  or omissions in rendering its software
development  and  maintenance  services,  there  can be no  assurance  that  the
limitations  of liability set forth in its contracts  will be enforceable in all
instances  or will  otherwise  protect the Company from  liability  for damages.
Although  the  Company  has  general  liability  insurance  coverage,  including
coverage for errors or omissions,  there can be no assurance  that such coverage
will  continue to be  available  on  reasonable  terms or will be  available  in
sufficient  amounts to cover one or more large claims,  or that the insurer will
not disclaim coverage as to

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

any future claim.  The successful  assertion of one or more large claims against
the Company that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in the Company's
insurance  policies,  including  premium  increases or the  imposition  of large
deductible or co-insurance requirements, would have a material adverse effect on
the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

12. SEGMENT INFORMATION

     The Company, operating globally,  provides software services for medium and
large  businesses.  North  American  operations  consist  primarily  of software
services  in the  United  States  and  Canada.  European  operations  consist of
software  services  principally  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  Ireland.   Asian
operations  consist of software  services  principally in India.  The Company is
managed on a geographic  basis.  Accordingly,  regional  sales  managers,  sales
managers,   account  managers,   project  teams  and  facilities  are  segmented
geographically  and decisions by the Company's  chief  operating  decision maker
regarding the allocation of assets and  assessment of  performance  are based on
such geographic segmentation.

     In  accordance  with  SFAS  No.  131,  "Disclosures  About  Segments  of an

          liable to certain of IMS Health's  prior  affiliates  for  liabilities
          arising out of or in  connection  with IMS  Health's  business and the
