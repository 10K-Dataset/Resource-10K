PART I

Item 1. Business

Overview

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation is a leading provider of custom information
technology (“IT”) services related to IT design, development, integration and maintenance services
primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in North America and Europe. Our core competencies
include web-centric applications, data warehousing, component-based development and legacy and
client-server systems. We provide the IT services we offer using an integrated on-site/offshore
business model. This seamless on-site/offshore business model combines technical and account
management teams located on-site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development
centers located primarily in India.

Industry Background

Many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics.
In addition, the evolution of technology and the commercialization of the Internet have contributed
to the rapid change in the business environment. In response to these challenges, many companies
are focused on improving productivity, increasing service levels, lowering costs and accelerating
delivery times. In order to achieve these goals, companies are implementing a broad range of
technologies, such as,

•

e-business and e-commerce applications;

•

data warehousing;

•

customer and supply chain management; and

•

middleware/enterprise application integration.

These technologies facilitate faster, more responsive, lower-cost business operations.
However, their development, integration and on-going maintenance present major challenges and
require a large number of highly skilled professionals trained in many diverse technologies. In
addition, companies also require additional technical resources to maintain, enhance and
re-engineer their core legacy IT systems and to address application maintenance projects.
Increasingly, companies are relying on custom IT solutions providers, such as us, to provide these
services.

In order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment, IT
departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on IT investments,
lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions. To accomplish these
objectives, many IT departments have shifted all or a portion of their IT development, integration
and maintenance requirements to outside service providers operating with on-site/offshore business
models.



Global demand for high quality, lower cost IT services from outside providers has created a
significant opportunity for IT service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of,
and address the challenges in using, an offshore talent pool. The effective use of offshore
personnel can offer a variety of benefits, including lower costs, faster delivery of new IT
solutions and more flexible scheduling. Certain developing countries, particularly India, have a
large talent pool of highly qualified technical professionals that can provide high quality IT
services at a lower cost. India is a leader in IT services, and is regarded as having one of the
largest pools of IT talent in the world. Historically, IT service providers have used offshore
labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers. However, evolving
customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher
value-added services. These services include application design, development, testing, integration
and maintenance, as well as technology consulting and infrastructure management. India’s services
and software exports have grown from approximately $10 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2003 to approximately $13 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, as estimated by the
National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) in India. NASSCOM forecasts that
exports from India should reach approximately $18 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.

Using an offshore workforce to provide value-added services presents a number of challenges to
IT service providers. The offshore implementation of value-added IT services requires that IT
service providers continually and effectively attract, train and retain highly skilled software
development professionals with the advanced technical skills necessary to keep pace with continuing
changes in information technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences.
These skills are necessary to design, develop and deploy high-quality technology solutions in a
cost-effective and timely manner. In addition, IT service providers must have the methodologies,
processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully
integrated with on-site personnel. Service providers must also have strong research and development
capabilities, technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete
effectively.

Our Solution

We believe that we have developed an effective integrated on-site/offshore business model, and
that this business model will be a critical element of our continued growth. To support this
business model, at December 31, 2004, we employed over 14,000 IT professionals globally. We have
also established facilities, technology and communications infrastructure in order to support our
business model. By basing certain technical operations in India, we have access to a large pool of
skilled, English-speaking IT professionals. These IT professionals provide high quality services to
our customers at costs significantly lower than services sourced exclusively in developed
countries. Our strengths, which we believe differentiate us from other IT service providers,
include the following:

Established and Scalable Proprietary Processes.

We have developed proprietary methodologies
for integrating on-site and offshore teams to facilitate cost-effective, on-time delivery of
high-quality projects. These methodologies comprise our proprietary Q*VIEW software engineering
process, which is available to all on-site and offshore programmers. We use this ISO 9001:2000
certified process to define and implement projects from the design,



development and deployment stages through on-going application maintenance. For most
projects, Q*VIEW is used as part of an initial setting up of processes that allows us to define the
scope and risks of the project and subdivide the project into smaller phases with frequent
deliverables and feedback from customers. We also use our Q*VIEW process to detect, mitigate and
correct possible quality defects and to establish appropriate contingencies for each project. In
order to ensure implementation of the quality process, we assign a quality facilitator to each
project who reports to a centralized quality assurance and software engineering group. This group
performs, on a sample basis, quality audits, deliverables verifications, metrics collection and
analysis, which are used to improve processes and methodologies. These processes and methodologies
have proven to be scalable, as we have significantly increased the number of offshore development
centers, customers and projects. In addition, all of our principal development centers have been
assessed by KPMG at Level 5 (the highest possible rating) of both the Capability Maturity Model and
the Capability Maturity Model Integration of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon
University, which are widely recognized means of measuring the quality and maturity of an
organization’s software development and maintenance processes. In addition, all of our principal
development centers have been certified by the STQC Directorate Ministry of Communications and
Information Technology, Government of India (the accreditation authority for companies in India)
under the internationally recognized BS 7799 Part 2:2002 Information Security Standards, a
comprehensive set of controls comprising best practices in information security and business
continuity planning. Our quality management system has also been certified by KPMG to
International Standard ISO 9001:2000 of the International Organization for Standardization, an
internationally recognized standard for quality management systems directed to the achievement of
business results, including satisfaction of customers and others.

Highly Skilled Workforce.

Our managers and senior technical personnel provide in-depth
project management expertise to customers. To maintain this level of expertise, we have placed
significant emphasis on recruiting and training our workforce of highly skilled professionals. We
have over 1,000 project managers and senior technical personnel around the world, many of whom have
significant work experience in the United States and Europe. We also maintain programs and
personnel to hire and train the best available technical professionals in both legacy systems and
emerging technologies. We provide five months of combined classroom and on-the-job training to
newly hired programmers, as well as additional annual training programs designed to enhance the
business practices, tools, technology and consulting skills of our professional staff. We were
recently assessed by KPMG at Level 5 (the highest possible rating) of the People Capability
Maturity Model (P-CMM) of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, a
widely recognized means of implementing best current practices in fields such as human resources,
knowledge management, and organizational development which improves our processes for managing and
developing our workforce and addressing critical people issues.

Research and Development and Competency Centers

. We have project experience and expertise
across multiple architectures and technologies, and have made significant investments in our
competency centers and in research and development to keep abreast of the latest technology
developments. Most of our programmers are trained in multiple technologies and architectures. As a
result, we are able to react to customers’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy programmers to
different technologies. In order to develop and maintain this flexibility, we have made a
substantial investment in our competency centers where the experience gained



from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire
organization. In addition, through our investment in research and development activities and the
continuing education of our technical personnel, we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the
necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies. We believe that our ability to work in
new technologies allows us to foster long-term relationships by having the capacity to continually
address the needs of both existing and new customers.

Well-Developed Infrastructure.

Our extensive facilities, technology and communications
infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our on-site and offshore workforces. This is
accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information
and to work directly on customer projects. This infrastructure allows for:

•

rapid completion of projects;

•

highest level of quality;

•

off-peak use of customers’ technological resources; and

•

real-time access to project information by the on-site account manager or the
customer.

International time differences enable our offshore teams located in India to access a
customer’s computing facilities located in North America and Europe during off-peak hours. This
ability to perform services during off-peak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and
does not require our customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software. In addition, for
large projects with short time frames, our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of
various development phases to accelerate delivery time. In addition, we can deliver services more
rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable
us to cost-effectively assign more professionals to a project.

Business Strategies

Our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading
provider of custom IT design, development, integration and maintenance services. We implement the
following core strategies to achieve these objectives:

Further Develop Long-Term Customer Relationships.

We have strong long-term strategic
relationships with our customers and business partners. We seek to establish long-term
relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities, frequently trying to establish
relationships with our customers’ chief information officers, or other IT decision makers, by
offering a wide array of cost-effective high quality services. Over 90% of our revenues in the year
ended December 31, 2004, were derived from customers who had been using our services for one year
or more. We also seek to leverage our experience with a customer’s IT systems into new business
opportunities. Knowledge of a customer’s IT systems gained during the performance of application
maintenance services, for example, may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing
additional development and maintenance projects from that customer.



Expand Service Offerings and Solutions.

We have several teams dedicated to developing new,
high value services. These teams collaborate with customers to develop these services. For example,
we are currently developing new solutions for IT systems portfolio analysis, program management,
technology architecture and strategy, systems testing, legacy restoration and digital security and
forensics. In addition, we invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge
building and sharing across the organization in order to promote the development of new services
and solutions that we can offer to our customers. Furthermore, we continue to enhance our
capabilities and service offerings in the areas of Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, and
Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP. We believe that the continued expansion of our service
offerings will reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and will help foster long-term
relationships with customers by allowing us to serve the needs of our customers better.

Enhance Processes, Methodologies and Productivity Toolsets.

We are committed to improving and
enhancing our proprietary Q*VIEW software engineering process and other methodologies and toolsets.
In light of the rapid evolution of technology, we believe that continued investment in research and
development is critical to our continued success. We are constantly designing and developing
additional productivity software tools to automate testing processes and improve project estimation
and risk assessment techniques. In addition, we use groupware technology to share project
experience and best practice methodologies across the organization with the objective of improving
productivity.

Expand Domestic and International Geographic Presence

. As we expand our customer base, we
plan to open additional sales and marketing offices in the United States and internationally. It is
expected that this expansion will facilitate sales and service to existing and new customers. We
have established sales and marketing offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Teaneck. In addition, we have been pursuing market opportunities
internationally through our offices in Toronto, London, Frankfurt, Zurich, Amsterdam, Tokyo and
Singapore.

Pursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances.

We believe
that opportunities exist in the fragmented IT services market to expand our business through
selective strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances. We believe that
acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence and our
capabilities more rapidly, especially in the European market, as well as accelerate our entry into
areas of new technology. In addition, through our working relationships with independent software
vendors we obtain projects using the detailed knowledge we gain in connection with a joint
development process. Finally, we will strategically partner with select IT service firms that offer
complementary services in order to best meet the requirements of our customers.



Services

We provide a broad range of IT services, including:

Summary Description

Application Design, Development, Integration and
Re-engineering

Define customer requirements, write specifications and
design, develop, test and integrate software across
multiple platforms including Internet technologies.
Modify and test applications to enable systems to
function in new operating environments.

Application Maintenance

Support some or all of a customer’s applications ensuring
that systems remain operational and responsive to
changing user requirements, and to provide on-going
enhancement as required by the customer.

We use our Q*VIEW software engineering process, our on-site and offshore business model and
well-developed technology and communications infrastructure to deliver these services.

Application Design Development, Integration and Re-engineering Services.

We follow either of
two alternative approaches to application development and integration:

•

full life-cycle application development, in which we assume start-to-finish
responsibility for analysis, design, implementation, testing and integration of
systems; or

•

cooperative development, in which our employees work with a customer’s in-house IT
personnel to jointly analyze, design, implement, test and integrate new systems.

In both cases, our on-site team members work closely with the end-users of the application to
define requirements and develop specifications. Detailed design, implementation and testing are
generally performed offshore at our seventeen IT development centers located in India, as well as
our development centers in Phoenix and Toronto. In addition, we maintain an on-site presence at
each customer location in order to address evolving customer needs and resulting changes to the
project.

A key part of our application development and integration offering is a suite of services to
help organizations build and integrate business applications with the rest of their operations. In
this suite of services, we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise
application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these new
applications and Web sites with client server and legacy systems. We build and deploy robust,
scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries. We maintain competency
centers specializing in Microsoft, IBM and Sun technologies, among others, in order



to be able to provide application development and integration services to a broad spectrum of
customers.

Our re-engineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy
computing environments to newer, open systems-based platforms and client/server architectures,
often in response to the more stringent demands of business. Our re-engineering tools automate many
of the processes required to implement advanced client/server technologies. We believe that this
automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform re-engineering services, savings that
benefit both us and our customers. These tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and
to re-design target databases and convert certain programming languages. If necessary, our
programmers also help customers re-design and convert user interfaces.

Application Maintenance Services.

We provide services to help ensure that a customer’s core
operational systems are free of defects and responsive to the customer’s changing needs. As part of
this process, we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service
levels to customers requesting modifications and on-going support.

Our on-site/offshore business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and
cost-effective support services to our customers. Our on-site team members often provide help-desk
services at the customer’s facility. These team members typically carry pagers in the event of an
emergency service request and are available to quickly resolve customer problems from remote
locations. In the case of more complex maintenance services, including modifications, enhancements
and documentation, which typically have longer turnaround times, we take full advantage of our
offshore resources to develop solutions more cost-effectively than would be possible relying on
higher cost local professionals. The services provided by our offshore team members are delivered
to customers using satellite and fiber-optic telecommunications.

As part of our application maintenance services, we assist customers in renovating their core
systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations, new standards or other external
events. These services include, or have previously included, Year 2000 compliance, Eurocurrency
compliance, decimalization within the securities industry and compliance with the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act for the healthcare industry.

Application maintenance service contracts are usually long term in nature and, at times, can
include an element of application development.

We seek to anticipate the operational environment of customer’s IT systems as we design and
develop such systems. We also offer diagnostic services to customers to assist them in identifying
shortcomings in their IT systems and optimizing the performance of their systems.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and
direct sales personnel operating out of our Teaneck headquarters and our business development
offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Teaneck,
London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Zurich, Toronto, Tokyo and Singapore. At December 31, 2004, we had
approximately 30 direct sales persons and over 150 account



managers. The sales and marketing group works with our technical team as the sales process
moves closer to the customer’s selection of an IT service provider. The duration of the sales
process varies depending on the type of service, ranging from approximately two months to over one
year. The account manager or sales executive works with the technical team to:

•

define the scope, deliverables, assumptions and execution strategies for a proposed
project;

•

develop project estimates;

•

prepare pricing and margin analyses; and

•

finalize sales proposals.

Management reviews and approves proposals, which are then presented to the prospective
customer. Our sales and account management personnel remain actively involved in the project
through the execution phase. We focus our marketing efforts on businesses with intensive
information processing needs. We maintain a prospect/customer database that is continuously updated
and used throughout the sales cycle from prospect qualification to close. As a result of this
marketing system, we pre-qualify sales opportunities, and direct sales representatives are able to
minimize the time spent on prospect qualification. In addition, substantial emphasis is placed on
customer retention and expansion of services provided to existing customers. In this regard, our
account managers play an important marketing role by leveraging their ongoing relationship with the
customer to identify opportunities to expand and diversify the type of services provided to that
customer.

Customers

The number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years. As of
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we were providing services to 233 customers, 153 customers and
115 customers, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we derived our revenues from the following business
segments: 49.5% from financial related services, 19.8% from healthcare services, 18.0% from
retail/manufacturing/logistics and 12.7% from other segments.

We provide services either on a time-and-material basis or on the basis of an agreed fixed
bid. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a
significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year. Approximately
13.7% of our revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 were generated from JPMorgan
Chase.



Our customers include:

ACNielsen Corporation

Competition

The intensely competitive IT services market includes a large number of participants and is
subject to rapid change. This market includes participants from a variety of market segments,
including:

Our most direct competitors include, among others, Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy
Services and WIPRO, which utilize an integrated on-site/offshore business model comparable to that
used by us. We also compete with large IT service providers with greater resources, such as
Accenture, Electronic Data Systems and IBM Global Services, who have announced their intentions to
develop more offshore capabilities to lower their cost structure. In addition, we compete with
numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing
resources and greater name recognition than we do. The principal competitive factors affecting the
markets for our services include:

•

performance and reliability;



•

quality of technical support, training and services;

•

responsiveness to customer needs;

•

reputation, experience and financial stability; and

•

competitive pricing of services.

We rely on the following to compete effectively:

Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We presently hold no patents
or registered copyrights. Instead, we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade
secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual
property. We require our employees, independent contractors, vendors and customers to enter into
written confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These
agreements generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on
our behalf be kept confidential. In addition, when we disclose any confidential or proprietary
information to third parties, we routinely require those third parties to agree in writing to keep
that information confidential.

A portion of our business involves the development for customers of highly complex information
technology software applications and other technology deliverables. This intellectual property
includes written specifications and documentation in connection with specific customer engagements.
Our customers usually own the intellectual property in the software we develop for them.

Pursuant to a license agreement with IMS Health, all rights to the “Cognizant’’ name and
certain related trade and service marks were transferred to us in July 1998. As of December 31,
2004, we held three trademark registrations in the United States and had four pending trademark
applications in India. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, we held 232 other trademark
registrations in 57 other countries.



Employees

At December 31, 2004, we employed a total of approximately 15,300 persons, including over
3,000 persons on a full-time basis in various locations throughout North America. We also employed
over 400 persons on a full-time basis in various locations throughout Europe, principally in the
United Kingdom, and over 11,500 persons on a full-time basis in our offshore IT development centers
in India. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining arrangement. We consider our
relations with our employees to be good.

Our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract, train and retain
highly skilled IT development professionals. In particular, we need to attract, train and retain
project managers, programmers and other senior technical personnel. We believe there is a shortage
of, and significant competition for, IT development professionals in the United States and in India
with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer. We have an
active recruitment program in India, and have developed a recruiting system and database that
facilitates the rapid identification of skilled candidates. During the course of the year, we
conduct extensive recruiting efforts at premier colleges and technical schools in India. We
evaluate candidates based on academic performance, the results of a written aptitude test measuring
problem-solving skills and a technical interview. In addition, we have an active lateral recruiting
program in North America, Europe and India. A substantial majority of the personnel on most
on-site teams and virtually all the personnel staffed on offshore teams is comprised of Indian
nationals.

Our senior project managers are hired from leading consulting firms in the United States and
India. Our senior management and most of our project managers have experience working in the United
States and Europe. This enhances our ability to attract and retain other professionals with
experience in the United States. We have also adopted a career and education management program to
define our employees’ objectives and career plans. We have implemented an intensive orientation and
training program to introduce new employees to the Q*VIEW software engineering process, our other
technologies and our services.

Corporate History

We began our IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994, as an in-house
technology development center for The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units. In
1996, we, along with certain other entities, were spun-off from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation to
form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, we completed an initial public
offering of our Class A common stock. On June 30, 1998, a majority interest in us, and certain
other entities were spun-off from Cognizant Corporation to form IMS Health. Subsequently, Cognizant
Corporation was renamed Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated. At December 31, 2002, IMS Health
owned 55.3% of our outstanding stock (representing all of our Class B common stock) and held 92.5%
of the combined voting power of our common stock.

On January 30, 2003, we filed a tender offer in which IMS Health stockholders could exchange
IMS Health shares held by them for our Class B common stock held by IMS Health.

On February 13, 2003, IMS Health distributed all of our Class B common stock that IMS Health
owned in an exchange offer to its stockholders. There was no impact on the number of our total
shares outstanding upon the completion of the exchange offer.

As of February 21, 2003, pursuant to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all of the
shares of Class B common stock automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock.
According to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if at any time the outstanding shares of
our Class B common stock ceased to represent at least 35% of the economic ownership represented by
the aggregate number of shares of our common stock then outstanding, each share of our Class B
common stock shall automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock. This automatic
conversion occurred on February 21, 2003 based on share numbers received by us from our transfer
agent (American Stock Transfer and Trust Company) as of the close of business February 20, 2003,
which indicated that the Class B common stock represented less than 35% ownership represented by
the aggregate number of shares of our common stock then outstanding. Accordingly, as of February
21, 2003, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding.

On April 12, 2004, the Board of Directors declared a conditional two-for-one stock split to be
effected by a 100% stock dividend payable on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27,
2004. The stock split was subject to stockholder approval which was obtained on May 26, 2004 and,
as a result, the stock dividend was paid on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27,
2004.

This stock split, as well as our other stock splits, have been reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, and all applicable references as to the number of common



shares and per share information were restated. Appropriate adjustments have been made in the
exercise price and number of shares subject to stock options. Stockholder equity accounts were restated
to reflect the reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued
common shares from the additional paid-in-capital account to the common stock accounts.

Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results

If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations
or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our Common
Stock could decline

.

A substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in India and we are subject to
regulatory, economic and political uncertainties in India.

We intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in India where, as of
December 31, 2004, a majority of our technical professionals were located. While wage costs are
lower in India than in the United States and other developed countries for comparably skilled
professionals, wages in India are increasing at a faster rate than in the United States, which
could result in our incurring increased costs for technical professionals and reduced operating
margins. In addition, there is intense competition in India for skilled technical professionals and
we expect that competition to increase.

India has also experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with
neighboring countries. In recent years, there have been military confrontations between India and
Pakistan that have occurred in the region of Kashmir and along the Indian-Pakistan border. The
potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions



related to recent terrorist incidents in India and the unsettled nature of the regional
geopolitical environment, including events in and related to Afghanistan. If India were to become
engaged in armed hostilities, particularly if these hostilities were protracted or involved the
threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction, our operations would be materially adversely
affected. In addition, U.S. companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of
international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where India is not involved because of
more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources.

In the past, the Indian economy has experienced many of the problems confronting the economies
of developing countries, including high inflation, erratic gross domestic product growth and
shortages of foreign exchange. The Indian government has exercised and continues to exercise
significant influence over many aspects of the Indian economy, and Indian government actions
concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities, including
us. In the past, the Indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain
regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the
economy, including the software development services industry. Programs that have benefited us
include, among others, tax holidays, liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on
foreign investment and repatriation. Notwithstanding these benefits, India’s central and state
governments remain significantly involved in the Indian economy as regulators. The elimination of
any of the benefits realized by us from our Indian operations could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties.

Revenues from customers outside North America represented 13%, 12% and 13% of our revenues for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We anticipate that revenues from
customers outside North America will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in
the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence, particularly in
Europe. In addition, a majority of our employees and almost all of our IT development centers are
located in India. As a result, we may be subject to risks associated with international operations,
including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated
with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or
export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic
conditions. From time to time, we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks
relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations
include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a
wide variety of foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other
barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable. There can be no assurance
that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.



We face intense competition from other IT service providers.

The intensely competitive IT professional services market includes a large number of
participants and is subject to rapid change. This market includes participants from a variety of
market segments, including:

The market also includes numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets
in which we operate. Our direct competitors who use the on-site/offshore business model include,
among others, Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and WIPRO. In addition, many of our
competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater
name recognition than we do. Some of these larger competitors, such as Accenture, Electronic Data
Systems and IBM Global Services, have offshore operations. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth as competitive pressures, including
competition for skilled IT development professionals and pricing pressure from competitors
employing an on-site/offshore business model, increase.

Our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services
in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment.

The IT services market is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry
standards, changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions. Our future
success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the IT
services market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new services
addressing evolving technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these services are
developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. In addition, there can be no assurance
that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services
non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement, in
a timely and cost-effective manner, solutions for customers moving from the mainframe environment
to client/server or other advanced architectures. Our failure to design and implement solutions in
a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.



Competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business
depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals.

Our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract, train and
retain highly skilled IT development professionals. In particular, we need to attract, train and
retain project managers, IT engineers and other senior technical personnel. We believe there is a
shortage of, and significant competition for, IT development professionals in the United States and
India with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer. We have
subcontracted, to a limited extent in the past, and may do so in the future, with other service
providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers. Our ability to maintain and renew
existing engagements and obtain new business will depend, in large part, on our ability to attract,
train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in
information technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences. Further, we
must train and manage our growing work force, requiring an increase in the level of responsibility
for both existing and new management personnel. There can be no assurance that the management
skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and
assimilate new employees successfully. Our failure to attract, train and retain current or future
employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions.

Our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical
and project management skills from developing countries, especially India. The vast majority of our
IT professionals in the United States and in Europe are Indian nationals. The ability of Indian
nationals to work in the United States depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the
necessary visas and work permits.

The H-1 B visa classification enables U.S. employers to hire qualified foreign workers in
positions which require an education at least equal to a U.S. Baccalaureate Degree in specialty
occupations such as IT systems engineering and systems analysis. The H-1 B visa usually permits an
individual to work and live in the United States for a period of up to six years. There is a limit
on the number of new H-1 B petitions that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“CIS,” one of
the successor agencies to the Immigration and Naturalization Service) may approve in any federal
fiscal year, and in years in which this limit is reached, we may be unable to obtain H-1 B visas
necessary to bring foreign employees to the United States. In the current federal fiscal year, the
limit is 65,000. This cap has been reached as of October 1, 2004. New H-1 B petitions may not be
filed until April 1, 2005, and these petitions must be for positions beginning no earlier than
October 1, 2005. However, as a part of our advanced planning process, we believe that we have
sufficient employees visa-ready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year. In
addition, there are strict labor regulations associated with the H-1 B visa classification. Higher
users of the H-1 B visa program are often subject to investigations by the Wage and Hour Division
of the U.S. Department of Labor. A finding by the U.S. Department of Labor of willful or
substantial failure by us to comply with existing regulations on the H-1 B classification may
result in a bar on future use of the H-1 B program.



We also regularly transfer employees of our subsidiary in India to the United States to work
on projects and at client sites, using the L-1 visa classification. The L-1 visa allows companies
abroad to transfer certain managers, executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to
related U.S. companies such as a parent, subsidiary, affiliate, joint venture or branch office. We
have an approved “Blanket L Program,” under which the corporate relationships of our transferring
and receiving entities have been pre-approved by the CIS, thus enabling individual L-1 applications
to be presented directly to a U.S. consular post abroad rather than undergoing the pre-approval
process in the United States. In recent years, both the U.S. consular posts that review initial L-1
applications and the CIS offices, which adjudicate extensions of L-1 status, have become more
restrictive with respect to this category. As a result, the rate of refusals of initial L-1
applications and of extension denials has increased. In addition, even where L-1 visas are
ultimately granted and issued, security measures undertaken by U.S. consular posts around the world
have caused major delays in visa issuances. Our inability to bring qualified technical personnel
into the United States to staff on-site customer locations would have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

On December 8, 2004, President Bush signed the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act. This
legislation contained several important changes to the laws governing L-1 visa holders. All of the
changes take effect on June 8, 2005. Under one provision of the new law, all L applicants,
including those brought to the U.S. under a Blanket Program, must have worked abroad with the
related company for one full year in the prior three years. The provision allowing Blanket L
applicants who had worked abroad for the related company for six months during the qualifying
three-year period has been revoked. In addition, L-1B holders (intracompany transferees with
specialized company knowledge) may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer
if the L-1B holder will be controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning
employer. Finally, L-1B status may not be granted where placement of the L-1B visa holder at a
third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party, rather than
placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving
specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer.

As to the other new provisions of the L-1 law, Cognizant does not place L-1B workers at third
party sites where they are under the supervision of a different employer, nor does Cognizant place
L-1B holders at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party, without
providing a service involving Cognizant’s specialized knowledge. However, it is not yet clear how
the U.S. Department of State and Citizenship and Immigration Services will interpret these
provisions of the new law. If these provisions are interpreted in a very restrictive fashion, this
could impair our ability to staff our projects in the U.S. with resources from our entities abroad.

We also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence for employees to fill positions
for which there are no able, willing and qualified U.S. workers available to fill the positions.
Compliance with existing U.S. immigration and labor laws, or changes in those laws making it more
difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent
residence for our foreign employees in the United States, could require us to incur additional
unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled
professionals we need for our operations in the United States. Any of these restrictions or



limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

In addition to immigration restrictions in the United States, there have recently been changes
to work permit legislation in the United Kingdom, where we have experienced significant growth.
Under the new regulations, in order for us to transfer our employees to the United Kingdom, either
from the United States or from India, we must demonstrate that the employee had been employed by us
for at least six months prior to the transfer. These restrictions restrain our ability to add the
skilled professionals we need for our operations in Europe, and could have an adverse affect on our
international strategy to expand our presence in Europe. As a result, the changes to work permit
legislation in the United Kingdom could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom and
other countries is subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the
application of standards and enforcement. Immigration and work permit laws and regulation can be
significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. Our international
expansion strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the
administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with
IT professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed.

Potential anti-outsourcing legislation could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers.

The issue of outsourcing of services abroad by American companies is a topic of political
discussion in the United States. Measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by U.S.
companies are under discussion in Congress and in as many as one-half of the state legislatures.
While no substantive anti-outsourcing legislation has been introduced to date, given the
intensifying debate over this issue, the introduction of such legislation is possible. If
introduced, such measures are likely to fall within two categories: (1) a broadening of
restrictions on outsourcing by federal government agencies and on government contracts with firms
that outsource services directly or indirectly, and/or (2) measures that impact private industry,
such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions. In the event that any
such measures become law, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected and our ability to service our customer could be impaired.

Hostilities involving the United States could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers.

Hostilities involving the United States, or military or travel disruptions and restrictions
affecting our employees, could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to
service our customers. As of December 31, 2004, a majority of our technical professionals were
located in India, and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the United States and
Europe are Indian nationals who are able to work in the United States and Europe only because they
hold current visas. Travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional



unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled
professionals we need for our operations in the United States and Europe.

Our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel.

Our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key
members of our management team, as well as marketing, sales and technical personnel, and our
ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel. We do not maintain key man life
insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees. Competition for personnel is
intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we
will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future. The loss of any one or
more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Restrictions in non-competition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable.

We have entered into non-competition agreements with all of our executive officers. There can
be no assurance, however, that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting the executive
officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable. Further, substantially all of our
professional non-executive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from
working for our competitors. If any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and
joins one of our competitors, our business could be adversely affected.

Our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in
India.

Prior to January 1, 2002, it was our intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India
to the United States. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an
international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic
expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, we generally have used Indian
earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings
to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes-Special Areas,” we no longer have to accrue
incremental United States taxes on all Indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as
these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. While we
have no plans to do so, events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change
our intent on repatriating Indian earnings. If we change our intent and repatriate such earnings,
we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes
at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2004. These increased taxes could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



A significant portion of our projects are on a fixed-price basis, subjecting us to the risks
associated with cost over-runs and operating cost inflation.

We contract to provide services either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-price
basis, with fixed-price contracts accounting for approximately 24% and 26% of our revenues for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We expect that an increasing number of our
future projects will be contracted on a fixed-price basis. We bear the risk of cost over-runs and
operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixed-price contracts. Our failure
to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixed-price project, or our failure to
complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business may suffer if we are unable to manage our rapid growth.

Our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other
resources. In particular, we will have to continue to increase the number of our personnel,
particularly skilled technical, marketing and management personnel, and continue to develop and
improve our operational, financial, communications and other internal systems. Our inability to
manage our anticipated growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

As part of our growth strategy, we are expanding our operations in Europe and Asia. We may not
be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be
substantially greater than we expect. If we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we
enter, or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition,
if we cannot compete effectively, we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our
international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings.

We rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues.

Approximately 38%, 36% and 38% of our revenues in years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively, were generated from our top five customers. Approximately 13.7% of our
revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 were generated from JPMorgan Chase. The volume
of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a major customer
in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year. The loss of one of our large customers
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers.

Consistent with industry practice, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our
customers. As a result, we are substantially exposed to volatility in the market for our services,
and may not be able to maintain our level of profitability. If we are unable to market our services
on terms we find acceptable, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer
materially.



Our operating results experience significant quarterly fluctuations.

We historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and
results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue. Among the factors causing these
variations have been:

•

the number, timing, scope and contractual terms of IT development and maintenance
projects in which we are engaged;

•

delays incurred in the performance of those projects;

•

the accuracy of estimates of resources and time required to complete ongoing
projects; and

•

general economic conditions.

In addition, our future revenues, operating results and margins may fluctuate as a result of:

A high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly personnel and rent, are relatively
fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, unanticipated variations in the number and
timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant
variations in our operating results in any particular quarter, and could result in losses. Any
significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations, any material reduction in
utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the on-site, offshore staffing mix, an
unanticipated termination of a major project, a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or
proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion during a quarter of several
major customer projects could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

As a result of these factors, it is possible that in some future periods, our revenues and
operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors. In such an event, the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely
affected.



We may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability.

Our gross margin of 45.5% and 45.8%, and our operating margin of 20.0% and 19.6%, for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, may decline if we experience declines in
demand and pricing for our services. In addition, wages in India are increasing at a faster rate
than in the United States, which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical
professionals. Although we have been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency
fluctuations through further leveraging of our low-cost operating structure and obtaining price
increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future.

Liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’
businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customer’s
computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our
responsibility for the failure. Although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages
arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes or omissions in rendering our IT development and
maintenance services, there can be no assurance that any contractual limitations on liability will
be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although
we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can
be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be
available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not
disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims
against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including
premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may have potential liability arising from the IMS Health exchange offer in the event that
we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement entered into
with IMS Health.

We entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, with IMS Health (the
“Distribution Agreement”), that provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply
with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the
representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its
opinion regarding U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition,
pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we agreed to indemnify IMS Health for any tax liability to
which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax
liability resulted solely from a breach of the representations that we made and were relied upon by
McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with
the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.



We may be subject to legacy Dun & Bradstreet liabilities that could have an adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.

In 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, now known as R.H. Donnelly Corporation, split
itself into three separate companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, Cognizant Corporation and
ACNielsen Corporation. In connection with the split-up transaction, The Dun & Bradstreet
Corporation, Cognizant Corporation (renamed Nielsen Media Research), of which Cognizant Technology
Solutions Corporation was once a part, and AC Nielsen Corporation (now a subsidiary of the Dutch
company VNU N.A.) entered into a distribution agreement. In the 1996 distribution agreement, each
party assumed the liabilities relating to the businesses allocated to it and agreed to indemnify
the other parties and their subsidiaries against those liabilities and certain other matters. The
1996 distribution agreement also prohibited each party thereto from distributing to our
stockholders any business allocated to it unless the distributed business delivered undertakings
agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 distribution
agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 distribution
agreement. IMS Health made such undertaking when it was spun off by Nielsen Media Research in 1998
and, accordingly, IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research are jointly and severally liable to R.H.
Donnelly and ACNielsen for Cognizant Corporation obligations under the terms of the 1996
distribution agreement. IMS Health has requested similar undertakings from Cognizant Technology
Solutions Corporation as a condition to the distribution of our shares in the exchange offer. IMS
Health is obligated to procure similar undertakings from Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation
to Nielsen Media Research and Synavant Inc. with respect to liabilities allocated to IMS Health in
connection with Nielsen Media Research’s spin-off of IMS Health and IMS Health’s spin-off of
Synavant Inc. In connection with the exchange offer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation has
given these undertakings and, as a result, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation may be
subject to claims in the future in relation to legacy liabilities.

One possible legacy liability arises from a pending antitrust action filed by Information
Resources Inc. in 1996, which names as joint defendants all parties to the 1996 distribution
agreement. Information Resources’ complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount
it has asked to be trebled, plus punitive damages. ACNielsen Corporation agreed in connection with
the 1996 distribution agreement to assume any and all liabilities resulting from the Information
Resources claim to the extent that ACNielsen remains financially viable. In connection with VNU’s
acquisition of ACNielsen in 2001, VNU was required to assume this liability and to be included with
ACNielsen for purposes of determining the amount that can be paid by ACNielsen in respect of any
claim. IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research, Inc., successors to Cognizant Corporation, have
agreed to share liabilities in excess of the amount ACNielsen is required to pay under the 1996
distribution agreement in respect of this claim on a 50-50 basis with The Dun & Bradstreet
Corporation (subsequently separated into The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Moody’s Corporation).
IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. further agreed to share their portion of the
liabilities in relation to the Information Resources action on a 75-25 basis, subject to Nielsen
Media Research, Inc.’s liability in respect of the Information Resources action and certain other
contingent liabilities being capped at $125 million. Pursuant to our undertaking, Cognizant
Technology Solutions Corporation could be held liable for those amounts that VNU, IMS Health,
Nielsen Media Research, Inc., and The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and their successors are unable
or unwilling to pay.



Other claims have arisen in the past and may arise in the future under the 1996 distribution
agreement or the distribution agreements relating to Nielsen Media Research’s spin-off of IMS
Health and IMS Health’s spin-off of Synavant Inc., in which case Cognizant Technology Solutions
Corporation may be jointly and severally liable for any losses suffered by the parties entitled to
indemnification.

IMS Health has agreed to indemnify Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation for any and all
liabilities that arise out of our undertakings to be jointly and severally liable for these
liabilities, but if for any reason IMS Health does not perform on our indemnification obligation,
these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe on the
intellectual property rights of others, our business may be adversely affected.

Our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property
rights. We presently hold no patents or registered copyrights, and rely upon a combination of
copyright and trade secret laws, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements and various
security measures to protect our intellectual property rights. India is a member of the Berne
Convention, and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of
foreign countries, including the laws of the United States. We believe that laws, rules,
regulations and treaties in effect in the United States and India are adequate to protect us from
misappropriation or unauthorized use of our copyrights. However, there can be no assurance that
these laws will not change and, in particular, that the laws of India will not change in ways that
may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components, libraries and toolsets from India to
the United States. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our
intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual
property, or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce
our rights. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology,
products or services which compete with our products and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or
misappropriate our products, services or proprietary information.

Although we believe that our intellectual property rights do not infringe on the intellectual
property rights of any of our competitors or others, there can be no assurance that infringement
claims will not be asserted against us in the future, that assertion of infringement claims will
not result in litigation or that we would prevail in that litigation or be able to obtain a license
for the use of any infringed intellectual property from a third party on commercially reasonable
terms, if at all. We expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our
competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and processes. Any infringement
claims, regardless of their outcome, could result in substantial cost to us and divert management’s
attention from our operations. Any infringement claim or litigation against us could, therefore,
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



We may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully.

We believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented IT services market to expand our
business through selective strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. We believe that acquisition
and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence, especially in the
European market, enter new technology areas or expand our capacity. There can be no assurance that
we will identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices,
consummate any acquisition or joint venture or successfully integrate any acquired business or
joint venture into our operations. Further, acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of
special risks, including diversion of management’s attention, failure to retain key personnel,
unanticipated events or circumstances and legal liabilities, some or all of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may
finance any future acquisitions with debt financing, the issuance of equity securities or a
combination of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to arrange cash,
adequate financing on acceptable terms. In addition, acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity
securities could be dilutive.

Provisions in our charter, by-laws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under Delaware
law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals.

Provisions in our charter and by-laws, each as amended, our stockholders’ rights plan and
Delaware General Corporate Law (“DGCL”) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover
proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management, including transactions in
which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market
prices. In addition, these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to
approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. Our board of directors has
the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to fix the rights and preferences, and
issue shares of preferred stock. Our charter provides for a classified board of directors, which
will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders.
The prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and to call a special
meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called
by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors. The supermajority-voting
requirement for specified amendments to our charter and by-laws allows a minority of our
stockholders to block those amendments. The DGCL also contains provisions preventing stockholders
from engaging in business combinations with us, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions
could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect
on the market price of the shares of our common stock.

Item 2. Properties

Our most recent building plans provide for construction of over 900,000 square feet of space
in new fully-owned development and training centers located in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta and
Bangalore, India. This supersedes our previous plans, announced in December 2003, which included
600,000 square feet of new space. Each of these development centers will contain up-to-date
technology infrastructure and communications capabilities.



In addition, we operate 17 leased development facilities in the following cities:
Bangalore, Chennai, Calcutta, Pune, and Hyderabad in India, Phoenix, Limerick and Toronto.

We operate out of our Teaneck, New Jersey headquarters and our regional and international
offices. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to support our existing operations. We
also believe that we will be able to obtain suitable additional facilities on commercially
reasonable terms on an “as needed’’ basis.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations

Overview

We are a leading provider of custom IT services related to IT design, development, integration
and maintenance services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in North America and Europe.
Our core competencies include web-centric applications, data warehousing, component-based
development and legacy and client-server systems. We provide IT services using an integrated
on-site/offshore business model. This seamless on-site/offshore business model combines technical
and account management teams located on-site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated
development centers located primarily in India.

In 2004, our revenue increased to $586.7 million compared to $368.2 million in 2003. Net
income increased to $100.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share in 2004 compared to $57.4 million or
$0.42 per diluted share in 2003. Our revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for our
application management and application development and integration services. We finished 2004 with
233 active clients compared to 153 in 2003. We anticipate that a significant portion of our
revenue growth in 2005 will come from increased penetration of existing clients. During 2004, 87%
of our revenue came from clients in North America. In 2005, we will look to expand our presence in
Northern Europe as we are starting to see an increased level of interest for offshore services in
that region. In 2004, our operating margin increased to approximately 20.0% compared to 19.6% in
2003. This was consistent with our targeted operating margin range of 19 to 20% of total revenues.

At December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits of $314.8
million, an increase of approximately $121 million compared to December 31, 2003. Our most recent
building plans provide for construction of over 900,000 square feet of space in new fully-owned
development and training centers located in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta and Bangalore, India. This
supersedes our previous plans, announced in December 2003, which included 600,000 square feet of
new space. Total construction costs related to this program are currently estimated to be
approximately $76.0 million, which we expect to fund primarily from current operations. We believe
our financial condition will remain strong. In addition, we will continue to consider acquisitions
of companies that can improve our capabilities in certain market niches or geographic areas.

On June 29, 2004, we announced our plans to wind-down operations at our development center
located in Limerick, Ireland and close the facility by March 31, 2005. We decided to close this
facility due to the increased cost structure resulting from the significant appreciation in the
value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar since the facility was acquired in 2002. The work
performed in this facility is being transferred to Cognizant’s operations in North America and
India. Currently, we expect to incur through 2005 aggregate incremental costs of approximately $1.6
million associated with the closure of this facility. In 2004, we have recorded expenses of
approximately $1.5 million primarily for severance, retention bonuses and an obligation to repay
funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of approximately $1.0
million through December 31, 2004. Approximately 50 employees are affected by the closure.



On April 12, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a conditional two-for-one stock split to be
effected by a 100% stock dividend payable on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27,
2004. The stock split was subject to stockholder approval which was obtained on May 26, 2004 and,
as a result, the stock dividend was paid on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27,
2004. The stock split has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and
all applicable references as to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information
have been restated to reflect the stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the earliest
period presented. Stockholders’ equity accounts have been restated to reflect a reclassification of
an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued shares of Class A common stock from the
additional paid-in-capital account to the Class A common stock account.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are
based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible
assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on-going
basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of
revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting, for certain
fixed-bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and
other long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will
differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management
judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements:

Revenue Recognition

. Revenues related to our fixed-price contracts are recognized as the
service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total
contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that
each contract’s cost to date bears to the total estimated cost (cost to cost method). Estimates of
total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and
recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may
result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated
financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit-worthiness of



each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of
the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Income Taxes.

Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax
assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global
company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions
where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as
making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve
complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution,
adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in
the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can also affect the overall
effective income tax rate.

On an on-going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have
considered future taxable income and on-going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in
assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to
realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to
the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise,
should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset
in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the
deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been
realized) in the period such determination was made.

Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export-oriented company, which, under the Indian
Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for
each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all
of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. In 2004, the ten-year tax
holiday expired for one STP and, accordingly, the export profits for that STP are subject to Indian
income tax. Export profits from the remaining STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100%
exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased
out by March of 2009. The tax holiday will not be expiring for any STPs in 2005. Prior to 2002, it
was management’s intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States;
accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $24.1 million on
all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we
made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure
investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy,
beginning in 2002, we intend to use Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United
States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January
1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, we no longer accrue incremental
U.S. taxes on Indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested
outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2004, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings
upon which no incremental U.S. taxes have been recorded is approximately $155.9 million. While we
have no plans to do so, if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to
be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such
earnings and pay taxes at a rate



substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2004. Due to the various
methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable
to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the
amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on earnings recognized prior to 2002 will require
adjustment.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“Act”) was enacted into law. The
Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned
abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled
foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations, and as of today,
uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Act. As such, we are not yet
in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that
have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Under the provisions of the Act and subject to the
completion of our analysis of the Act and the operating results of our controlled foreign entities
during 2005, we will be eligible to repatriate some amount between $0 and $500 million. Due to the
complexities of domestic and foreign tax law and the lack of clarity surrounding the Act, we cannot
reasonably estimate the tax liability if we elect to repatriate any accumulated foreign earnings.
We expect to finalize our assessment in 2005 after further guidance is published . The funds may
only be repatriated in 2005.

Goodwill.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant.
When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including
projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and
their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of
fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2004, our goodwill balance
was approximately $9.7 million.

Long-lived Assets

. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, we review for impairment
of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize
an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the
carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the
fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risks.

Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located
in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations,
including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated
with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import
and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or
political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include
difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide
variety of foreign laws, potential geo-political and other risks associated with terrorist
activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs,
quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance



with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our independent auditor
to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial
reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not
limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which
could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Item 1 “Business – Additional Factors
That May Affect Future Results” for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business,
operations or financial results.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Revenue

. Revenue increased by 59.3%, or approximately $218.4 million, from approximately
$368.2 million during 2003 to approximately $586.7 million in 2004. This increase resulted
primarily from increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since
December 31, 2003, including acquisitions. Specifically, our financial services segment accounted
for approximately $120 million of the year over year increase. Demand for application development
and integration services increased significantly due to continued strength in our customers’
discretionary spending. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% and 10.1% of our revenues in 2004 and
2003, respectively. No other customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2004 or
2003.

Gross Profit

. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related
to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 60.1%, or approximately $120.1 million, from
approximately $199.7 million during 2003 to approximately $319.8 million in 2004. The



increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the
number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct
result of greater demand for our services. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately
$98.4 million, from approximately $168.5 million during 2003 to approximately $266.9 million during
2004. Gross profit margin decreased from 45.8% of revenues during 2003 to 45.5% of revenues in
2004. The decrease in such gross profit margin was attributable, in part, to the appreciation of
the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

. Selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management,
finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses,
including depreciation and amortization, increased by 55.1%, or approximately $53.0 million, from
approximately $96.2 million during 2003 to approximately $149.2 million during 2004, and decreased
as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.1% to 25.4%, respectively. The increase in such
expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and
marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in
such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased
revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and
prior years partially offset by the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar.

Income from Operations

. Income from operations increased 62.7%, or approximately $45.3
million, from approximately $72.3 million during 2003 to approximately $117.6 million during 2004,
representing approximately 19.6% and 20.0% of revenues, respectively. The increase in operating
margin was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our
expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years.

Other Income/Expense, Net.

Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and
foreign currency transaction gains or losses and for the year ended December 31, 2003,
non-recurring split-off costs of $2.0 million related to direct and incremental expenses (

e.g.

,
legal and accounting fees, printing and registration costs) incurred by us directly related to our
split-off from IMS Health. Interest income increased from $2.1 million during 2003 to approximately
$4.4 million during 2004. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested cash
balances and an increased portion of this balance held in foreign currencies which earn slightly
higher interest rates.

Provision for Income Taxes

. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $14.9
million in 2003 to approximately $21.9 million in 2004, with an effective tax rate of 20.6% in 2003
and 17.9% in 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2004 is primarily attributed
to India’s conversion of the withholding tax on dividends to an additional corporate tax on the
distribution of profits.

Net Income

. Net income increased from approximately $57.4 million in 2003 to approximately
$100.2 million in 2004, representing approximately 15.6% and 17.1% as a percentage of revenues,
respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior
period was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the one-time non-



recurring split-off costs referred to above and a lower effective income tax rate for 2004
compared to 2003.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Revenue

. Revenue increased by 60.7%, or approximately $139.1 million, from approximately
$229.1 million during 2002 to approximately $368.2 million in 2003. This increase resulted
primarily from an increase in both application management and development services, revenue
generated from acquisitions and an increase in our active customer base to 153 at the end of 2003
compared to 115 in 2002. We provide services through time-and-materials and fixed-bid contracts.
Revenues from fixed-bid contracts increased as a percentage of total revenues from 24.6% in 2002 to
25.9% in 2003. This increase is attributable primarily to increased demand due to our customers
preferring to specifically quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts.

Gross Profit

. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes,
benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related
to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 62.8%, or approximately $77.0 million, from
approximately $122.7 million during 2002 to approximately $199.7 million in 2003. The increase was
due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our
technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of
greater demand for our services and employees acquired through acquisitions. Our gross profit
increased by 58.4%, or approximately $62.1 million, from approximately $106.4 million during 2002
to approximately $168.5 million during 2003. Gross profit margin decreased from 46.4% of revenues
during 2002 to 45.8% of revenues in 2003. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily
attributable to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

. Selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management,
finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses,
including depreciation and amortization, increased by 57.2%, or approximately $35.0 million, from
approximately $61.2 million during 2002 to approximately $96.2 million during 2003, and decreased
as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.7% to 26.1%, respectively. The increase in such
expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and
marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in
such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased
revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and
prior years.

Income from Operations

. Income from operations increased 60.0%, or approximately $27.1
million, from approximately $45.2 million during 2002 to approximately $72.3 million during 2003,
representing approximately 19.7% and 19.6% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating
margin was due primarily to the lower gross margin partially offset by our ability to leverage
prior sales and marketing investments.



Other Income/Expense, Net

. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income
and split-off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health offered to its stockholders
to exchange its holdings of our Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. Interest income
increased by approximately 17.7%, from approximately $1.8 million during 2002 to approximately $2.1
million during 2003. The increase in such interest income was attributable to higher invested cash
balances partially offset by lower global interest rates. We recognized split-off costs of
approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Provision for Income Taxes

. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $10.5
million in 2002 to approximately $14.9 million in 2003, with an effective tax rate of 23.4% in 2002
and 20.6% in 2003. The lower effective tax rate is a result of a reduction in the surtax in India
and the restoration of the 100% exemption on export earnings both of which were effective April 1,
2003.

Net Income

. Net income increased from approximately $34.6 million in 2002 to approximately
$57.4 million in 2003, representing approximately 15.1% and 15.6% as a percentage of revenues,
respectively. The higher percentage in 2003 is primarily attributed to the decrease in the
effective tax rate discussed above.

Results by Business Segment

During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the completion of organizational changes, we
changed our basis of segmentation to industry segments from geographic segments. Our reportable
segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction
processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers
and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which includes
manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing
logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which,
individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other
reportable segment includes media, information services, telecommunications and high technology
operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams,
who were previously organized based upon geographical segments, have been realigned in accordance
with the specific industries they serve.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizant’s performance and allocates
resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as
income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating
segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges.
However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may
affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating
profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for
use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion
of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management
does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not
directly attributable to any specific segment.



Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted only
against the total income from operations.

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” prior periods segment disclosure has been restated to reflect industry segments for
all periods presented. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before
unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics,
and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits of
approximately $314.8 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of



existing operations, including our offshore software development centers; (ii) continued
development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation
of joint ventures; and (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December
31, 2004 and 2003, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $338.9 and
$220.6 million, respectively. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near-term liquidity issues.

Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $127.3 million, $79.9 million and
$56.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in
2004 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income. Trade
accounts receivable increased from approximately $36.7 million at December 31, 2002 to
approximately $52.3 million at December 31, 2003 and to approximately $96.4 million at December 31,
2004. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2002
to approximately $9.5 million at December 31, 2003 and increased to approximately $14.2 million at
December 31, 2004. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2004
was due primarily to increased revenue. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts
receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and
evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2004, our days’ sales outstanding, including
unbilled receivables, was approximately 59 days as compared to 53 days and 56 days at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $68.4 million, $37.8 million and $35.5
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004
compared to 2003 relates to the investment of a portion of our cash balances in short term bank
deposits to achieve a higher return on invested balances and our increased investment in property
and equipment to expand our offshore development structure. The increase in 2003 compared to 2002
primarily reflects our increased investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore
development infrastructure, offset, in part, by lower spending for acquisitions in 2003.

Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $36.8 million, $21.8 million, and
$20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in
each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock
options and employee purchases of stock, partially offset by payment of split-off costs in 2003.

We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from
operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least
the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans,
to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long-term capital requirements beyond
this 12-month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash
flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with
capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, our ability not to
breach the Distribution Agreement between IMS Health and us, especially as it relates to our tax
indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity



financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on
terms favorable to us, if at all.

During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six-month term
and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for U.S. dollars. We have entered
into this forward contract to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk related to Indian Rupee
denominated asset balances, primarily cash investments, at our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India.
Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon
remeasurement of the Cognizant India’s financial statements into its functional currency, the U.S.
dollar. Our objective is to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the
value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the
forward contract, referred to above. The forward contract is marked to market and recorded at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the
caption “other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income.

Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor
have we entered into off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with
unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of
or requirements for capital resources.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have expanded our plans to construct additional fully-owned development and training
centers to now include over 900,000 square feet of new space as compared to previous plans,
announced in December 2003, to add 600,000 square feet of space. The new facilities will be located
in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta and Bangalore, India. Total construction costs related to this program
are expected to be approximately $76.0 million, which we expect to fund internally. As of December
31, 2004, we have entered into fixed capital commitments of approximately $22.0 million related to
this India development center expansion program, of which approximately $14.7 million has been
spent to date. The remaining fixed capital commitments are payable within the next two years.

We lease office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates
through the year 2010. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require that we pay
utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under
operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December
31, 2004 are as follows (in thousands):


$

12,010


10,139


6,276


5,137


4,187

Thereafter

2,557

Total minimum lease payments

40,306



In connection with our acquisition of Infopulse, additional purchase price, not to exceed 3.5
million Euros (approximately $4.7 million) is payable in 2006 contingent on Infopulse achieving
certain revenue and operating income targets for the 24 month period ending December 31, 2005. In
addition, approximately $1.1 million of the total Infopulse purchase price is payable in 2005.

We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided
adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating
results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements
involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide
benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customer’s computer system could result
in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure.
Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts,
errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance
services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts
will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions,
there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or
will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will
not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims
against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including
premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a
material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash
flows.

In connection with the Split-Off from IMS Health, we entered into a Distribution Agreement,
dated January 7, 2003, with IMS Health, referred to as the Distribution Agreement. The
Distribution Agreement provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and
not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations
made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to
the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be
subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted
solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will &
Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution
Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual
operating results, financial position and cash flows.

Foreign Currency Translation

A portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange
fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations.



Related Party Transactions

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on February 13, 2003 (the
“Split-Off Date”), IMS Health distributed all of the Cognizant common stock that IMS Health owned
in an exchange offer to IMS Health stockholders (the “Split-Off”). As a result of the Split-Off,
IMS Health is no longer a related party as of the Split-Off Date. Accordingly, our revenues from
IMS Health subsequent to the Split-Off Date are classified as third party revenues. We recognized
related party revenues from IMS Health totaling approximately $2.6 million and $20.4 million in
2003 and 2002, respectively. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party
revenues prior to the Split-Off Date, were approximately $22.7 million.

Effects of Inflation

Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and
other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with
advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase
at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must
adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we
charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25), and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement
of Cash Flows.” Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in
SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans, to be
recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an
alternative under the new standard.

We must adopt SFAS No. 123(R) no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption is permitted in
periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123(R)
on July 1, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) allows for two transition methods. The basic difference between
the two methods is that the modified-prospective transition method does not require restatement of
prior periods, whereas the modified-retrospective transition method will require restatement.

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share-based payments to employees using
APB No. 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for
employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan. Although the full
impact of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)’s fair value method has not yet been determined, we
expect that it will have a significant impact on our results of operations. The disclosure under
SFAS No. 123 of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had recognized compensation
cost for share-based payments under SFAS No. 123 for



the three years ended December 31, 2004 is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact
of recognizing compensation cost for share-based payments under SFAS
No. 123(R) in future periods.
The potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) is dependent on levels of share-based payments
granted, the specific option pricing model utilized to determine fair value and the transition
methodology selected.

Forward Looking Statements

The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are
forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements may be
identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,”
“expects,” “may,” “will,” “should” or “anticipates” or the negative thereof or other variations
thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and
uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking
statements, orally or in writing. Such forward-looking statements may be included in various
filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral
statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These
forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, contract
percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not
historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could
differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.
There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from
those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the
section entitled “Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business
as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee.
Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of
foreign currency fluctuations. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward
contract, with a six-month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for
U.S. dollars. We may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign
currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. Other
than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we
entered into off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with
unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of
or requirements for capital resources.

We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest
rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits. As of December
31, 2004, we had approximately $314.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank
deposits which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short-term interest rates.



Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The financial statements required to be filed pursuant to this Item 8 are appended to this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. A list of the financial statements filed herewith is found at “Item
15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedule, and Reports on Form 8-K.”

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Not applicable.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2004. In designing and
evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives and management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, our
disclosure controls and procedures were (1) effective in that they were designed to ensure that
material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer by others within those entities, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and (2) effective in that they provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

Our management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of all information presented
in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based
on management’s best estimates and judgments. Management believes the consolidated financial
statements fairly reflect the form and substance of transactions and that the financial statements
fairly represent the Company’s financial position and results of operations.



The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent
directors, meets regularly with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and
representatives of management to review accounting, financial reporting, internal control and audit
matters, as well as the nature and extent of the audit effort. The Audit Committee is responsible
for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm. The independent auditors
registered public accounting firm has free access to the Audit Committee.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or
15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by
our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies
and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, the company’s management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on its evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, our
internal control over financial reporting was effective. Our management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which is included on page F-2.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation:

We have completed an
integrated audit of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation’s 2004
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions,
based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cognizant Technology
Solutions Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial
statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in “Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting” appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based
on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public

F - 2


Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over
financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in
the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;

COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

1. Basis of Presentation

Description of Business.

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (“Cognizant” or the “Company”)
is a leading provider of custom information technology (“IT”) services related to IT design,
development, integration and maintenance services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in
North America and Europe. Cognizant’s core competencies include web-centric applications, data
warehousing, and component-based development and legacy and client-server systems. Cognizant
provides the IT services it offers using an integrated on-site/offshore business model. This
seamless onsite/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located
on-site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located primarily in
India.

Organization.

Cognizant began its IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994,
as an in-house technology development center for The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and its operating
units. In 1996, Cognizant, along with certain other entities, was spun-off from the Dun &
Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, Cognizant
completed its initial public offering of its Class A common stock. On June 30, 1998, a majority
interest in Cognizant, and certain other entities were spun-off from Cognizant Corporation to form
IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS Health’’). Subsequently, Cognizant Corporation was renamed Nielsen
Media Research, Incorporated. At December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned 55.3% of the outstanding
stock of Cognizant.

Split-Off from IMS Health

. On February 13, 2003 (the “Split-Off Date”), IMS Health distributed all
of the Cognizant common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to IMS stockholders (the
“Split-Off”). As a result of the Split-Off, IMS Health and its affiliates are no longer related
parties of Cognizant as of the Split-Off Date. Accordingly, only services rendered to or received
from IMS Health and its affiliates during the period January 1, 2003 to the Split-Off Date are
classified as related party transactions. Services rendered to or received from IMS Health
subsequent to the Split-Off Date are classified as third party transactions. (See Note 9).

In connection with the Split-Off, Cognizant was obligated to pay the costs associated with the
Split-Off (the “Split-Off Costs”) in connection with the exchange offer under the provisions of an
Intercompany Agreement, dated as of May 15, 1998. The Intercompany Agreement provided that
Cognizant would pay its own costs, without reimbursement, and the costs of IMS Health (other than
underwriting discounts, commissions and certain other specified costs) necessary to facilitate a
sale or spin-off of IMS Health’s ownership interest in the Company.

In 2003, Cognizant incurred direct and incremental costs of $2,010 resulting from external
costs contractually incurred related to the Split-Off. Such costs included direct legal,
accounting, printing and other costs, including a non-cash charge calculated in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and
Related Interpretations” (“APB No. 25”) of approximately $488 related to the retention,
acceleration and extended life of Cognizant common stock options held by two former
Directors of Cognizant who resigned on the Split-Off Date as a condition of the Split-Off.
Such former Directors were, as of the Split-Off Date, officers of IMS Health.

F - 8


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

Of the total $3,690 of Split-Off Costs incurred and recorded, including approximately $1,680
recorded in 2002, all costs were paid as of December 31, 2003. Cognizant did not receive any
proceeds from the IMS Health exchange offer.

Capital Stock.

In connection with the Split-Off, IMS Health, as the Company’s majority stockholder
at that time, approved amendments to Cognizant’s certificate of incorporation that became effective
following consummation of the Split-Off. The material terms of these amendments:

•

provided for a classified board of directors;

•

set the number of Cognizant’s directors; and

•

provided for supermajority approval requirements for actions to amend, alter,
change, add to or repeal specified provisions of Cognizant’s certificate of
incorporation and any provision of the by-laws.

In connection with the Split-Off, Cognizant’s Board of Directors also approved amendments to
Cognizant’s by-laws, which became effective following completion of the Split-Off. The material
terms of these amendments made to Cognizant’s by-laws affected nominations of persons for election
to the Board of Directors and proposals of business at annual or special meetings of stockholders.
Cognizant’s Board of Directors also adopted a stockholders’ rights plan providing certain rights to
stockholders under certain circumstances.

On April 12, 2004, the Board of Directors declared a conditional two-for-one stock split to be
effected by a 100% stock dividend payable on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27,
2004. The stock split was subject to stockholder approval at the Company’s May 26, 2004 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders of an amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase
the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock. On May 26, 2004, the Company’s
stockholders approved such amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and as a result,
a 100% stock dividend was paid on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27, 2004. The
stock split has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and all
applicable references as to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information have
been restated to reflect the stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the earliest period
presented. Stockholders’ equity accounts have been restated to reflect a $653 reclassification of
an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued shares of Class A common stock from the
additional paid-in-capital account to the Class A common stock account. The amendment to the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation increased the number of authorized shares of Class A common
stock to 325,000,000 and eliminated the authorization of Class B common stock.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

. The consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries for all periods presented. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.

F - 9


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

. The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of
three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
primarily consist of cash deposits and highly liquid investments in investment grade short-term
debt securities.

Investment in Short-Term Bank Deposits.

The Company’s investments in bank deposits mature in less
than one year. These short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximate fair value.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The
allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit-worthiness of each
customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the
receivables.

Unbilled Accounts Receivable.

Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenues on contracts to be
billed, in subsequent periods, as per the terms of the related contracts.

Short-term Financial Assets and Liabilities

– Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables,
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities are short-term in nature and, accordingly, their
carrying values approximates fair value.

Investments

. Investments in business entities in which the Company does not have control or the
ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies are accounted
for under the cost method. Investments are evaluated for impairment at least annually, or as
circumstances warrant.

Property and Equipment

. Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of
the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. Deposits paid towards
acquisition of long-lived assets and the cost of assets not put in use before the balance sheet
date are disclosed under the caption “capital work-in-progress” in Note 3.

Internal Use Software

. Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or
obtained for internal use are capitalized, including the salaries and benefits of employees that
are directly involved in the installation of such software. The capitalized costs are amortized on
a straight-line method over the lesser of three years or its useful life. Costs associated with
preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage
activities are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No.
142”), which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead tested at the
reporting unit level for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant. If an
impairment is indicated, a write-down to fair value (normally measured by discounting estimated

F - 10


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

future cash flows) is recorded. Other intangibles represent primarily customer relationships and
assembled workforce, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives.

Long-Lived Assets

. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets”, the Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. In general, the Company will recognize an impairment loss when the
sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets.
The impairment loss would equal the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset.

Revenue Recognition

. The Company’s services are entered into on either a time-and-materials or
fixed-price basis. Revenues related to time-and-material contracts are recognized as the service is
performed. Revenues related to fixed-price contracts that provide for highly complex information
technology application development services are recognized as the service is performed using the
percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total value of revenue is recognized

on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s cost to date bears to the total estimated cost
(cost to cost method). Revenues related to fixed-priced contracts that provide solely for
application maintenance services are recognized on a straight-line basis or as services are
rendered or transactions processed in accordance with contractual terms. Expenses are recorded as
incurred over the contract period.

Effective July 1, 2003, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Consensus
00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). For contracts with
multiple deliverables, the Company evaluates at the inception of each new contract all deliverables
in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. For
arrangements with multiple units of accounting, primarily fixed-price contracts that provide both
application maintenance and application development services and certain application maintenance
contracts, arrangement consideration is allocated among the units of accounting, where separable,
based on their relative fair values and revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting based on
the Company’s revenue recognition policy described above

.

The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have
a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Fixed-price contracts are cancelable subject to a specified notice period. All services
provided by the Company through the date of cancellation are due and payable under the contract
terms. The Company issues invoices related to fixed-price contracts based upon achievement of
milestones during a project or other contractual terms. Differences between the timing of
billings, based upon contract milestones or other contractual terms, and the recognition of
revenue, based upon the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, are recognized as either
unbilled or deferred revenue. Estimates of certain fixed-price contracts are subject to adjustment
as a project progresses to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of
any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in
estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are
recognized immediately. Warranty provisions generally exist under such contracts for a period

F - 11


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

of ninety days past contract completion and costs related to such provisions are accrued at the
time the related revenues are recorded.

Revenues related to services performed without a signed agreement or work order are not
recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement, such as when agreements or work orders are
signed or payment is received; however, the cost related to the performance of such work is
recognized in the period the services are rendered.

For all services, revenue is recognized when, and if, evidence of an arrangement is obtained
and the other criteria to support revenue recognition are met, including the price is fixed or
determinable, services have been rendered and collectibility is assured.

The Company accounts for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses as revenues. Cost of
revenues is exclusive of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment.

Accounting for Stock-Based Employee Compensation Plans.

In the first quarter of 2003, the Company
adopted the interim disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (SFAS No. 148) which amended SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods to transition for a voluntary change to
fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and requires
disclosures in annual and interim financial statements of the effects of stock-based compensation
as reflected below. The Company continues to account for its stock-based employee compensation
plans (as more fully described in Note 8) under the recognition and
measurement principles of APB No.
25. Except for approximately $488 calculated in accordance with APB No. 25 related to the
retention, acceleration and extended life of Cognizant common stock options by two former Directors
of Cognizant included in Split-Off Costs and one grant in 1998, no employee stock-based
compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under the plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and
for the stock purchase plan the discount does not exceed 15%.

F - 12


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

Had compensation cost for the Company’s stock-based compensation plans been determined based
on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans, consistent with the method
prescribed by SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, the Company’s net income and net income per
share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

Foreign Currency Translation

. The assets and liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries other than
the Company’s Indian subsidiary (“Cognizant India”), are translated into U.S. dollars from local
currencies at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated from local currencies
at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. For Cognizant India, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar,
since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S.
dollars and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between
Cognizant India and its U.S. affiliates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at
historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange
rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included in the caption other income (expense), net on the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Currency transaction
gains and losses, which are included in the results of operations, are immaterial for all periods
presented. Gains and losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of financial position and represents the
only item included in such caption.

Foreign Currency Forward Contract

– In July 2004, the Company entered into a foreign currency
forward contract, with a six-month term and notional amount of $12,500, to sell the Indian Rupee
for U.S. dollars. The counterparty is a credit worthy major financial institution. The Company
entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of its foreign currency risk related to
Indian Rupee denominated net asset balances, primarily cash investments of Cognizant India.
Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon
remeasurement of Cognizant India’s financial statements into its functional currency, the U.S.
dollar. The Company’s objective is to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or
depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains
or losses on the forward contract, referred to above.

The Company is accounting for this financial derivative in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. This foreign currency
contract does not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. Accordingly, the foreign
currency forward contract is marked-to-market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption “other income (expense),
net” on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. At December
31, 2004, the fair value of the foreign currency forward contract was a liability of $989. For the
year ended December 31, 2004, the unrealized loss on the foreign currency forward contract has been
recorded as part of net foreign currency transaction gains of $73.

Exit Activities

– One-time termination benefits are recognized and measured at fair value at the
communication date if the employee would not be retained beyond a minimum retention period (i.e.,
either a legal notification period or 60 days, if no legal requirement exists). For employees that
will be retained beyond the minimum retention period, a liability is accrued ratably over the
future service period.

On June 29, 2004, the Company announced that it plans to wind-down operations at its
development center located in Limerick, Ireland and close the facility by March 31, 2005. The
Company expects to incur during 2004 and 2005 aggregate incremental costs of approximately

F - 14


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

$1,600 associated with the closure of this facility. In 2004, the Company has recorded
expenses of approximately $1,500 primarily for severance, retention bonuses and an obligation to
repay funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of approximately
$1,000. Retention bonuses are being expensed over each eligible employee’s future service period.
As of December 31, 2004, the Company had an accrual of approximately $500 for wind-down costs.
Fixed assets related to this facility are not material and will be depreciated ratably through
March 31, 2005. Approximately 50 employees are affected by the closure.

Use of Estimates

. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the
recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported period. On an on-going basis, management reevaluates these estimates. The most
significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion
method of accounting for certain fixed-bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income
taxes and related deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation of goodwill and other long-lived
assets, contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual
amounts may vary from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

Risks and Uncertainties

. Principally, all of the Company’s IT development centers, including a
majority of its employees are located in India. As a result, the Company may be subject to certain
risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective
legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign
policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. From time to time, the
Company will engage in hedging transactions to mitigate its risks relating to foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include
difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide
variety of foreign laws, potential geo-political and other risks associated with terrorist
activities and local or cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs,
quotas and other barriers.

Concentration of Credit Risk

. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
investments in short-term bank deposits and trade accounts receivable. The Company maintains its
cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions in investment-grade, short-term
debt securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one commercial issuer. See Note
12.

Income Taxes.

The Company provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the
tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and

F - 15


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits
associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. Tax benefits earned on exercise of employee stock
options in excess of compensation charged to income are credited to additional paid in capital.

Prior to 2002, it was management’s intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to
the United States; accordingly, the Company has provided deferred income taxes on all such
undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company
made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure
investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy,
beginning in 2002, the Company intends to use Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the
United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective
January 1, 2002, pursuant to APB No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes-Special Areas”, the Company
has not accrued incremental U.S. taxes on Indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods
as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
Deferred U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings from other foreign entities have not been
provided for as such earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested.

Earnings Per Share (“EPS”).

Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing earnings
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted EPS includes all potential dilutive common stock in the weighted average shares
outstanding.

Reclassifications

. Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2004
presentation.

New Accounting Standard — Issued but Not Yet Effective

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. SFAS
No. 123(R) supersedes APB No. 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Generally, the
approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS
No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the income statement
based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new
standard.

Cognizant must adopt SFAS No. 123(R) no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption is permitted
in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. Cognizant expects to adopt SFAS
No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) allows for two transition methods. The basic
difference between the two methods is that the modified-prospective transition method does not
require restatement of prior periods, whereas the modified-retrospective transition method
will require restatement.

F - 16


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using APB No. 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no
compensation cost for employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase
plan. Although the full impact of Cognizant’s adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)’s fair value method has
not yet been determined, the Company expects that it will have a significant impact on its results
of operations. The disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the Company had
recognized compensation cost for share-based payments under SFAS No. 123 for the three years ended
December 31, 2004 is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation
cost for share based payments under SFAS No. 123(R) in future periods. The potential impact of
adopting SFAS No. 123(R) is dependent on levels of share-based payments granted, the specific
option pricing model utilized to determine fair value and the transition methodology selected.

4. Acquisitions

On February 27, 2004, the Company acquired Ygyan Consulting Private Ltd. (“Ygyan”), an
India-based SAP services provider, for $1,676. Ygyan was acquired to increase the Company’s SAP
service capabilities.

On November 24, 2003, the Company acquired the stock of Infopulse Nederland B.V.
(“Infopulse”), a Netherlands-based information technology services company specializing in the
banking and financial services industry for approximately $6,900 (including approximately $400 of
direct deal costs) of which approximately $1.1 million is payable in 2005. Additional purchase
price, not to exceed 3.5 million Euros (approximately $4,700), payable in 2006 is contingent on
Infopulse achieving certain revenue and operating income targets for the 24-month period ending
December 31, 2005. This acquisition will allow the Company to improve its service capabilities in
the Benelux region by adding local client partners, industry expertise and local language
capability.

On April 1, 2003, the Company acquired the U.S.-based company of ACES International, Inc.
(“ACES”), that specializes in Customer Relationship Management solutions, serving clients in
healthcare, financial services and telecommunications verticals, for approximately $4,700
(including approximately $500 of direct deal costs).

The Company has accounted for the acquisitions of Ygyan, Infopulse and ACES as business
combinations under the provisions of SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” The operating results
of Ygyan, Infopulse and ACES have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company, effective February 27, 2004, November 24, 2003 and April 1, 2003, respectively. The
Company recorded approximately $7,600 of goodwill and $1,800 of intangible assets, principally
customer relationships, in connection with the 2003 acquisitions. (See Note 5.)

On June 30, 2002, Cognizant Technology Solutions Ireland Limited (“Cognizant Ireland”), a
newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, purchased certain assets

F - 18


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

and assumed certain liabilities from UnitedHealthcare Ireland Limited (“UHCI”), a subsidiary
of UnitedHealth Group, for $3,043 (including approximately $143 of direct deal costs). In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, this transaction was determined to be an acquisition of assets, not a
business combination. UHCI, through Cognizant Ireland, provides application development and
maintenance services. (See Note 2.)

On October 29, 2002, the Company completed the transfer of Silverline Technologies, Inc.’s
(“Silverline”) practice, which serviced a major financial services company to the Company for
$10,424 (including approximately $620 of direct deal costs). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, this
transaction was determined to be an acquisition of assets, not a business combination. Under the
terms of the transfer, the Company provides application design, development and maintenance
services to such major financial services company through an acquired workforce of approximately
300 IT and support professionals located primarily in the United States and India

.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company has allocated, based upon independent appraisals,
the respective purchase prices to the UHCI and Silverline tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities acquired. The operating results of Cognizant Ireland and Silverline have been included
in the consolidated financial statements of the Company effective July 1 and October 29, 2002,
respectively. The Company recorded intangible assets of approximately $13,200 in connection with
the 2002 acquisitions. (See Note 5.)

The operating results of Ygyan, Infopulse, ACES, UHCI and Silverline, for the periods included
indicated above, were not material to the consolidated operating results of the Company for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

6. Employee Benefits

The Company has a 401(k) savings plan which allows eligible U.S. employees of the Company to
contribute a percentage of their compensation into the plan and the Company matches up to 50.0% of
the eligible employee’s contribution. The amount charged to expense for the matching contribution
was $1,046, $642 and $479 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Certain of the Company’s employees participate in a defined contribution plan in the United Kingdom
and Ireland sponsored by the Company. The costs to the Company related to these plans were not
material to the Company’s results of operations or financial position for the years presented.

Cognizant India maintains employee benefit plans that cover substantially all India-based
employees. The employees’ provident fund, pension and family pension plans are statutory defined
contribution retirement benefit plans. Under the plans, employees contribute up to 12% of their
base compensation, which is matched by an equal contribution by Cognizant India. Contribution
expense recognized was $2,254, $1,310 and $928 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

Cognizant India also maintains a statutory gratuity plan that is a statutory post-employment
benefit plan providing defined lump sum benefits. Cognizant India makes annual contributions to an
employees’ gratuity fund established with a government-owned insurance corporation to fund a
portion of the estimated obligation. The Company estimates its obligation based upon employees’
salary and years of service. Contribution expense recognized by the

At December 31, 2004, Cognizant has estimated net operating loss carryforwards for U.S.
tax purposes of approximately $94,200. For Federal purposes, these losses have expiration dates
ranging from December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For state purposes, the date of
expiration varies but will generally be less than or equal to the Federal expiration period. The
Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $8,000, of which
approximately $6,700 relates to pre-acquisition net operating losses. The Company has recorded a
full valuation allowance on the foreign net operating loss carryforwards. If tax benefits are
recognized through reduction of the valuation allowance, approximately $2,300 of such benefits will
reduce goodwill. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date.

Cognizant’s Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export-oriented company, which, under
the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive
years for each Software Technology Park (“STP”) with respect to export profits for each STP.
Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. In 2004,
the ten-year tax holiday period expired for one STP and, accordingly, the export profits for that
STP are subject to income tax. Export profits from the remaining STPs in India are currently
entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be
completely phased out by March of 2009. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
effect of the income tax holiday was to reduce the overall income tax provision and increase net
income by approximately $24,208, $12,423 and $7,683, respectively, and increase diluted EPS by
$0.17, $0.09 and $.06, respectively.

Prior to January 1, 2002, it was the Company’s intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings
from India to the United States. Accordingly, Cognizant has provided deferred income taxes in the
amount of approximately $24,115 on all such pre–2002 undistributed earnings.

F - 22


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

During the first quarter of 2002, Cognizant made a strategic decision to pursue an
international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic
expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, Cognizant intends to use 2002 and
future Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating
these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to APB No.
23, Cognizant no longer accrues incremental U.S. taxes on all Indian earnings recognized in 2002
and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of
the United States. As of December 31, 2004, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings upon which
no incremental U.S. taxes has been recorded is approximately $155,858. If such earnings are
repatriated in the future, or no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, Cognizant will accrue
the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings. Due to the various methods by which
such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the
amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation.

The lower effective income tax rate of 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared
to 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2003, is principally attributed to India’s conversion of
the withholding tax on dividends to an additional corporate tax on the distribution of profits.

Deferred U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings from other foreign entities have not been
provided for as such earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) was enacted into law.
The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned
abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled
foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations, and as of today,
uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Act. As such, the Company is
not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, Cognizant might repatriate foreign
earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Under the provisions of the Act and subject
to the operating results of its controlled foreign corporations during 2005, the Company will be
eligible to repatriate some amount between $0 and $500 million. Due to the complexities of
domestic and foreign tax law and the lack of clarity surrounding the Act, the Company cannot
reasonably estimate the tax liability if it elects to repatriate any accumulated foreign earnings.
The Company expects to finalize its assessment in 2005 after further guidance is published. The
funds may only be repatriated in 2005.

8. Employee Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Key Employees Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of up to 8,385,000 stock options
(each option exercisable into one (1) share of the Company’s Class A common stock) to eligible
employees. Options granted under this plan may not be granted at an exercise price less than fair
market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. These options have a life of ten
years, vest proportionally over four years and have an exercise price equal to the fair market
value of the common stock on the grant date.

The Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of up to 858,000 stock
options (each option exercisable into one (1) share of the Company’s Class A common

stock) to eligible directors. Options granted under this plan may not be granted at an
exercise price less than fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. These
options have a life of ten years, vest proportionally over two years and have an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date.

The 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the grant of up to 36,000,000 stock options
(each option exercisable into one (1) share of the Company’s Class A common stock) to eligible
employees, non-employee Directors and independent contractors. Options granted under this plan may
not be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value of the underlying shares on the
date of grant. All options have a life of ten years, vest proportionally over four years, unless
specified otherwise, and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock
on the date of grant.

On May 26, 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase
Plan”) that provides for the issuance of up to 3,000,000 shares of Class A common stock to eligible
employees. The Purchase Plan provides for eligible employees to designate, in advance of specified
purchase periods, a percentage of compensation to be withheld from their pay and applied towards
the purchase of such number of whole shares of Class A common stock as can be purchased at a price
of 90% of the lesser of (a) the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the first
date of the purchase period; or (b) the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the
last date of the purchase period. No employee can purchase more than $25 worth of stock annually,
and no stock can be purchased by any person which would result in the purchaser owning more than
five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the
Company.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately 240,288 shares of Class A common stock
were purchased by employees under the Purchase Plan. At December 31, 2004, there were approximately
2,759,712 shares available for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.

9. Related Party Transactions and Transactions with Affiliates

Revenues

. The Company and IMS Health have entered into Master Services Agreements pursuant to which
the Company provides certain IT services to IMS Health. As a result of the Split-Off, IMS Health is
no longer a related party to the Company as of the Split-Off Date. Accordingly, revenues from IMS
Health subsequent to the Split-Off Date are classified as third party revenues. The Company
recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling $2,575 and $20,429 in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party revenues prior to
the Split-Off Date, were approximately $22,675.

Services

. IMS Health provides the Company with certain administrative services under the provisions
of an amended and restated Intercompany Services Agreement entered into in connection with the
Split-Off. In 2003 and prior periods, IMS Health permitted the Company to participate in certain of
IMS Health’s business insurance plans and provided certain other services such as tax planning and
compliance, which have since been transitioned to the Company. Total costs charged in connection
with these services during the period January 1, 2003 through the Split-Off Date and, in 2002 were
$28 and $656, respectively.

The Company has a strategic relationship with The Trizetto Group Inc. (“Trizetto”) that
includes helping its healthcare customers integrate Trizetto’s products with their existing
information systems and, within Trizetto, supporting further development of these software
applications. As of the Split-Off Date, IMS Health owned approximately 26.4% of the outstanding
common stock of Trizetto. The Company recorded revenues from Trizetto of approximately $831 from
January 1, 2003 through the Split-Off Date and $2,577 in 2002. The Company recorded expenses
related to Trizetto commissions of approximately $9 from January 1, 2003 through the Split-Off Date
and $697 in 2002.

Pension Plans

. In 2003 and 2002, certain U.S. employees of the Company participated in IMS
Health’s defined benefit pension plans. The plans are cash balance pension plans under which six
percent of creditable compensation plus interest is credited to the employee’s retirement account
on a monthly basis. The cash balance earns monthly investment credits based on the 30-year Treasury
bond yield. At the time of retirement, the vested employee’s account balance is actuarially
converted into an annuity. The Company’s cost for these plans is included in the allocation of
expense from IMS Health for employee benefits plans.

10. Commitments

The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various
dates through the year 2010. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require the
Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental
payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as
of December 31, 2004 are as follows:

add 600,000 square feet of space. The new facilities will be located in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta
and Bangalore, India. The total construction expenditure related to this expanded program is
estimated to be approximately $76,000, an increase of approximately $34,000, when compared to the
expansion program announced in December 2003. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has entered
into fixed capital commitments of $22,011 related to this India development center expansion
program, of which $14,708 has been spent to date.

11. Contingencies

The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided
adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial
condition and results of operations. Additionally, many of the Company’s engagements involve
projects that are critical to the operations of its customers’ business and provide benefits that
are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for
substantial damages against the Company, regardless of the Company’s responsibility for such
failure. Although the Company attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising
from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering its software development and
maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in its
contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect the Company from liability
for damages. Although the Company has general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for
errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on
reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or
that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one
or more large claims against the Company that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in the
Company’s insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or
co-insurance requirements, would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results
of operations and financial condition.

The Company entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, with IMS Health (the
“Distribution Agreement”), that provides, among other things, that IMS Health and the Company will
comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the
representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its
opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition,
pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to
which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax
liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations of the Company made to and were
relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If the Company breaches any of its
representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification
liability could be material to the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash
flows.

12. Segment Information

During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the completion of organizational changes,
the Company changed its basis of segmentation to industry segments from geographic segments. The
Company’s reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking /
transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes
healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail /
Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well
as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry segments
which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated

F - 27


COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media,
information services, telecommunications and high technology operating segments. The Company’s
sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams, which were previously
organized based upon geographical segments, have been realigned in accordance with the specific
industries they serve.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s performance and allocates
resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as
income from operations before unallocated costs. Expenses included in segment operating profit
consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of
the Company’s development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a
portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as
management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because
they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Accordingly, these expenses are
separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted only against the total income from operations of
the Company. Additionally, management has determined that it is not practical to allocate
identifiable assets, by segment, since such assets are used interchangeably among the segments.

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” prior periods segment disclosure has been restated to reflect industry segments for
all periods presented. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before
unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics,
and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:
