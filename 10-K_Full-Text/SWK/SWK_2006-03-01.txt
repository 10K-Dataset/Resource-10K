brands and are sold primarily on a direct
sales basis as well as, in certain instances, through third party
distributors.

Competition

The Company competes on
the basis of its reputation for product quality, its well-known brands,
its commitment to customer service, strong customer relationships, the
breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on product
innovation.

The Company encounters active competition in all of
its businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the
same or similar products and services or that produce different
products appropriate for the same uses. The Company has a large number
of competitors; however, aside from a small number of competitors in
the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware business who produce a
range of products somewhat comparable to the Company's, the
majority of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more
individual products or product lines within a particular segment. The
Company is one of the largest manufacturers of hand tools in the world
featuring a broader line than any other toolmaker. The Company is a
leader in the manufacture and sale of pneumatic fastening tools and
related fasteners to the construction, furniture and pallet industries
as well as a leading manufacturer of hand-held hydraulic tools used for
heavy construction, railroad, utilities and public works. The Company
also believes that it is among the largest direct access security
integration service providers in North America.

Several of the
Company's largest retail customers have elected to compete with
the Company by developing house brands and sourcing products (generally
from low cost countries).

Customers

A substantial
portion of the Company's products are sold to home centers and
mass merchants in the U.S. and Europe. In 2005, net sales to The Home
Depot were 12% of the Company's consolidated sales from
continuing operations. A consolidation of retailers both in North
America and abroad has occurred over time. While this consolidation and
the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers
provide the Company with opportunities for growth, the increasing size
and importance


of individual customers creates a certain
degree of exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of the customer
referred to above, as well as certain of the other larger home centers
or mass merchants as customers, could have a material adverse effect on
the Company until either such customers were replaced or the Company
made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of
business.

Despite the trend toward customer consolidation, the
Company has a diversified customer base and has decreased this
potential risk over the past years as sales from continuing operations
in markets outside of the home center and mass merchant distribution
channel have grown at a greater rate through a combination of efforts
to broaden the customer base, primarily in the Security Solutions and
Industrial Tools segments. In this regard, sales to the Company's
largest customer as a percentage of total Company sales has decreased
from 22% to 12% since 2002.

Raw
Materials

The Company's products are manufactured of
both ferrous and non-ferrous metals to include, but not limited to
steel, aluminum, zinc, and copper. Additionally, the Company uses other
commodity based materials for components and packaging including but
not limited to, plastics, wood, and other corrugated products. The raw
materials required are available from a number of sources at
competitive prices and the Company has annual or quarterly spot
contracts with many of its key suppliers. Certain commodity prices,
particularly energy related and non-ferrous metals, may increase in
2006, but the Company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining
supplies for any raw materials used in its production process.

Backlog

Due to short order cycles and rapid inventory
turnover in most of the Company’s Consumer Products and
Industrial Tools businesses, backlog is generally not considered a
significant indicator of future performance. At February
5,  2006, the Company had approximately $274  million in
unfilled orders compared with $279  million in unfilled orders at
February  6,  2005. All of these orders are reasonably
expected to be filled within the current fiscal year. Most customers
place orders for immediate shipment and as a result, the Company
produces primarily for inventory, rather than to fill specific
orders.

Patents and Trademarks

No business segment
is dependent, to any significant degree, on patents, licenses,
franchises or concessions and the loss of these patents, licenses,
franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on
any of the business segments. The Company owns numerous patents, none
of which are material to the Company's operations as a whole.
These patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. The
Company holds licenses, franchises and concessions, none of which
individually or in the aggregate are material to the Company's
operations as a whole. These licenses, franchises and concessions vary
in duration, but generally run from one to 20 years.

The Company
has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide. The
STANLEY

®

and STANLEY in a notched rectangle design trademarks are
material to all three business segments. These well-known trademarks
enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are among the
world's most trusted brand names. The Company's tagline,
‘‘Make Something Great™’’ is the
centerpiece of the brand strategy for all segments. The Bostitch

these trademarks vary, typically, from 10 to 20 years, with most
trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like
terms.

Environmental Regulations

The Company is
subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and
foreign countries where it has operations. Future laws and regulations
are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the
Company's expenditures related to environmental
matters.


The Company is a party to a number of
proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to
environmental remediation. Additionally, the Company, along with many
other companies, has been named as a potentially responsible party
(‘‘PRP’’) in a number of administrative
proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites, including
twelve active Superfund sites.

Current laws potentially impose
joint and several liabilities upon each PRP. In assessing its potential
liability at these sites, the Company has considered the following:
whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms of existing
agreements, experience at similar sites, and the fact that its
volumetric contribution, if any, at these sites is relatively
small.

The Company's policy is to accrue environmental
investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can
be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on
an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each
individual site and includes such factors as existing technology,
presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take
into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties.
As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the
amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As
of December  31,  2005, the Company had reserves of
approximately $21.3  million, for remediation activities
associated with Company-owned properties as well as for Superfund
sites, for losses that are probable and estimable.

The amount
recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates.
Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available.
Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the
estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental
exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future
environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may
have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the
amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

Employees

At December  31,
2005, the Company had approximately 15,800 employees, nearly 8,500 of
whom were employed in the U.S. Approximately 800 U.S. employees are
covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 13
different local labor unions who are, in turn, affiliated with
approximately 6 different international labor unions. The majority of
the Company's hourly-paid and weekly-paid employees outside the
U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The
Company's labor agreements in the U.S. expire in 2006, 2007,
2008, 2009 and 2010. There have been no significant interruptions or
curtailments of the Company's operations in recent years due to
labor disputes. The Company believes that its relationship with its
employees is good.

1(d) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC
AREAS

Financial information regarding the Company's
geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to Note P Business
Segments and Geographic Areas of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.

1(e) AVAILABLE INFORMATION

The Company's website is located at
http://www.Stanleyworks.com. (This URL is intended to be an inactive
textual reference only. It is not intended to be an active hyperlink to
our website. The information on our website is not, and is not intended
to be, part of this Form 10-K and is not incorporated into this report
by reference.) Stanley makes its Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and amendments
to each available free of charge on its website as soon as reasonably
practicable after filing them with, or furnishing them to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 1A. RISK
FACTORS

The Company’s business, operations and
financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You
should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below,
together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the


heading entitled ‘‘Cautionary
Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995’’, and in other documents that the Company files
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, before making any
investment decision with respect to its securities. If any of the risks
or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company’s
business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth
prospects could change. Under these circumstances, the trading prices
of the Company’s securities could decline, and you could lose
all or part of your investment in the Company’s
securities.

Large customer concentration and related
inventory corrections may negatively impact sales, results of
operations and cash flows.

The Company has certain
significant customers, particularly home centers and major retailers
such as The Home Depot, Lowe’s and Wal-Mart. The Home Depot
individually accounted for 12% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales from continuing operations in the year ended
December  31,  2005. The loss or material reduction of
business from, or the lack of success of sales initiatives for the
Company’s products by, any such significant customer could have
a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations
and cash flows.

In addition, unanticipated inventory
corrections by such customers can have a negative impact on sales. For
example, severe inventory corrections taken by certain large North
American home center customers in December  2005 negatively
impacted sales by approximately $30  million against normal
levels. Such corrections have also impacted sales in the first quarter
of 2006.

Customer consolidation could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business.

A
substantial portion of the Company’s products in the Consumer
Products and Industrial Tools segments are sold through home centers
and mass merchant distribution channels. A consolidation of retailers
in both North America and abroad has occurred over time and the
increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of
exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of certain larger home
centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business until either such customers were replaced or
the Company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss
of business.

The Company's growth and repositioning
strategies include acquisitions. The Company’s recent
acquisitions may not further its strategies and the Company may not be
able to identify suitable future acquisition
candidates.

In 2002, the Company embarked on a
growth strategy to shift its business portfolio toward favored growth
markets through acquisitions and divestitures, and thereby to reduce
the risk associated with large customer concentrations. The strategy
has been advanced over the last three years with the sales of the
Company's residential entry door and home décor
businesses, and the acquisition of a number of companies, including
Facom S.A. (‘‘Facom’’), National
Manufacturing Co. (‘‘National’’), Best Lock
Corporation and its affiliates (‘‘Best
Access’’), Chicago Steel Tape Co. and affiliates
(‘‘CST/Berger’’), Blick plc
(‘‘Blick’’), Frisco Bay Industries Ltd
(‘‘Frisco Bay’’), ISR Solutions, Inc.
(‘‘ISR’’), Security Group, Inc.
(‘‘Security Group’’) and Precision
Hardware, Inc. (‘‘Precision’’).

Although the Company has extensive experience with
acquisitions, there can be no assurance that recently acquired
companies will be successfully integrated and effectively implement the
Company’s growth and repositioning strategy. If the Company
successfully integrates the transactions and effectively implements its
repositioning strategy, there can be no assurance that its resulting
business segments will enjoy continued market acceptance or
profitability.

In addition, there can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable future
acquisition candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain the
necessary financing, complete the transactions or successfully
integrate the new company as necessary to continue growth and
repositioning strategies.

The
Company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its
business and operations.

The Company has made a
number of acquisitions in the past three years, including, but not
limited to, Facom in January  2006, National in November
2005, Precision in May  2005, Security


Group in January  2005, ISR in
December  2004, Frisco Bay in March  2004, CST/Berger and
Blick in January  2004 and Best Access in November  2002.
The Company may make additional acquisitions in the future.
Acquisitions involve a number of risks,
including:

•

the diversion of the
Company's management's attention and other resources,

•

the incurrence of unexpected liabilities,
and

•

the loss of key personnel and
clients or customers of acquired companies.

Any
intangible assets that the Company acquires may have a negative effect
on its financial statements. In addition, the success of the
Company's future acquisitions will depend in part on its ability
to:

•

combine operations,

•

integrate departments, systems and
procedures, and

•

obtain cost savings and
other efficiencies from the acquisitions.

Failure to
effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions may adversely
affect the Company's existing businesses and harm its operational
results. The Company is still in the process of integrating the
businesses and operations of Best Access, Blick, CST/Berger, ISR,
Security Group, Precision, Facom, National and other acquisitions with
its existing businesses and operations, and the Company cannot ensure
that such integration will be successfully completed.

The
Company may incur significant additional indebtedness, enter into other
financing arrangements or issue additional equity securities in
connection with future acquisitions which may restrict the manner in
which it conducts business, limit the Company’s ability to
implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive
effect on earnings.

As more fully described in Item
7 and Note I Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company issued
$450  million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities through its
Trust subsidiary, the net proceeds of which were used to finance a
portion of the acquisitions of Facom and National. In addition, the
Company recently amended its five year revolving credit agreement,
increasing the size from $400  million to $550  million,
and including provisions that allow designated subsidiaries to borrow
up to $250  million in Euros and Pound Sterling, which may be
available to, among other things, fund acquisitions.

The
instruments and agreements governing certain of the Company’s
current indebtedness contain, and instruments and agreements governing
indebtedness incurred in the future may contain, restrictive covenants
that include, among other things:

•

a
limitation on creating liens on certain property of the Company and its
subsidiaries;

•

maintenance of specified
financial ratios;

•

a restriction on
entering into certain sale-leaseback transactions; and

•

customary events of default. If an event of
default occurs and is continuing, the Company might be required to
repay all amounts outstanding under the respective instrument or
agreement.

Such covenants could restrict the Company in
the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in
the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies.

The
Company’s brands are an important asset of its business and
violation of its trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact
sales and brand reputation.

The
Company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value
and are important to its success and competitive position. Unauthorized
imitation of its products or unauthorized use of its trademark rights
may not only erode sales of the Company’s products, but may also
cause significant


damage to its brand name and reputation, its
ability to effectively represent the Company to its customers,
contractors, suppliers, and/or licensees, as well as divert management
time and attention. There can be no assurance that the Company’s
on-going effort to protect its brand and trademark rights will prevent
all violations. In addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of
some foreign countries may not allow the Company to protect its
proprietary rights to the same extent as it is able to in the United
States.

The Company has trademark licensing programs and
licensees may not comply with product quality, manufacturing standards,
marketing and other requirements.

The Company
licenses its trademarks to third parties for manufacturing, marketing,
distribution and sale of various products. While it enters into
comprehensive licensing agreements with its licensees covering product
design, product quality, sourcing, manufacturing, marketing and other
requirements, such licensees may not comply fully with those
agreements. Non-compliance could include marketing products under the
Company’s brand names that do not meet its quality and other
requirements or engaging in manufacturing practices that do not meet
the Company’s supplier code of conduct. These activities could
harm brand equity, reputation and business.

Successful
sales and marketing efforts depend on the Company’s ability to
recruit and retain qualified employees.

The success
of the Company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the
contributions and abilities of key executives, its sales force and
other personnel, including the ability of its sales force to adapt to
any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate
customer coverage. The Company must therefore continue to recruit,
retain and motivate management, sales and other personnel sufficient to
maintain its current business and support its projected growth. A
shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the Company’s
ability to implement its growth strategy.

The Company faces
active competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business
may suffer.

The Company faces active competition
and resulting pricing pressures. The Company’s products compete
on the basis of, among other things, its reputation for product
quality, its well-known brands, price, innovation and customer service
capabilities. The Company competes with both larger and smaller
companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that
produce different products appropriate for the same uses. These
companies are often located in countries such as China, Taiwan and
India where labor costs are substantially lower than in the United
States, Canada and Western Europe. To remain profitable and defend
market share, the Company must maintain a competitive cost structure,
develop new products and services, respond to competitor innovations
and enhance its existing products in a timely manner. In addition, the
Company may have to adjust prices on many of its products and services
to stay competitive and retain market share. The Company may not be
able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its
competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on its sales and profit margins.

The Company’s
results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflation in the
cost of raw materials, freight and energy.

The
Company's products are manufactured of both ferrous and
non-ferrous metals, including but not limited to steel, aluminum, zinc,
and copper. Additionally, the Company uses other commodity based
materials for components and packaging including, but not limited to;
plastics, wood, and other corrugated products. As described in more
detail in Item 7 hereto, the Company has been negatively impacted by
commodity and freight inflation in recent years and it expects energy
and certain commodity prices, particularly non-ferrous metals, may
increase. If the Company is unable to mitigate these inflation
increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction
initiatives, its profitability may be adversely affected.

The Company’s failure to continue successfully managing,
defending and accruing for claims and litigation could negatively
impact its results of operations or cash flows.

As
described in further detail in Items 1 and 3 and Note S Contingencies
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the
Company becomes involved in various litigation


matters arising out of the ordinary routine
conduct of its business, including, from time to time, litigation
relating to such items as commercial transactions, product liability,
workers compensation, intellectual property claims, regulatory actions
and environmental matters. There can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to continue to successfully manage and defend such
matters. In addition, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating
certain exposures, actual costs to be incurred in future periods may
vary from the Company’s estimates for such contingent
liabilities.

The Company is exposed to market risk from
changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation which could
negatively impact profitability.

Exposure to
foreign currency risk results because the Company, through its global
operations, enters into transactions and makes investments denominated
in multiple currencies. The Company’s predominant exposures are
in European, Canadian and Asian currencies, including the Chinese
Renminbi (‘‘RMB’’). In preparing its
financial statements, for foreign operations with functional currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated
at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using
weighted average exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar strengthens
relative to local currencies, the Company’s earnings could be
negatively impacted. Although the Company utilizes risk management
tools, including hedging, as it deems appropriate, to mitigate market
fluctuations in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that such
measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation
exposure will be eliminated.

In addition, on July
21,  2005, China announced it will let the RMB fluctuate within a
very tight band (+/- .3% around weighted average prior day
close) thereby effectively adopting a managed float and ending its
decade-old valuation de facto peg to the U.S. dollar. The
Company sources significant products from China and other Asian low
cost countries for resale in other regions. To the extent the
RMB or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the U.S.
dollar, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases.
While the present 3% appreciation of the RMB should not generate
material cost increases for RMB denominated purchases, further
appreciation of this or other currencies utilized for procurement could
adversely affect profitability. The Company may not be successful at
implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate
the related cost increases.

The Company’s business is
subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing
overseas.

The Company imports large quantities
of finished goods, components and raw materials. Substantially all of
its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to
tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements or
bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which the
Company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported
from may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or
other restrictions on its imports or adversely modify existing
restrictions. Imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign
currency variation which may increase the Company's cost of goods
sold. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or the
Company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs
regulations or similar laws, could harm the Company’s
business.

The Company’s operations are also
subject to the effects of international trade agreements and
regulations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the
activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although
these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade
liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or
eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured
in a particular country, trade agreements can also impose requirements
that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as setting
quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into
key markets such as the U.S. or the European Union.

The
Company’s ability to import products in a timely and
cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or
issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers,
such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or
increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other
countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require
the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to
avoid


disruption to customers. These alternatives
may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit
costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s
business and financial condition.

If the Company were
required to write down all or part of its goodwill or indefinite-lived
tradenames, its net income and net worth could be materially adversely
affected.

As a result of the Company’s
acquisitions, it has $741  million of goodwill and $107 million
of indefinite-lived tradenames recorded on its Consolidated Balance
Sheet at December  31,  2005. The Company is required to
periodically determine if its goodwill or indefinite-lived tradenames
have become impaired, in which case it would write down the impaired
portion of the intangible asset. If the Company were required to write
down all or part of its goodwill or indefinite-lived tradenames, its
net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected.

If the Company’s investments in its pension plans do not
perform as expected, the Company may have to contribute additional
amounts to these plans, which would otherwise be available to cover
operating and other expenses.

As described in
further detail in Note M Employee Benefit Plans of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company sponsors
pension and other post retirement benefit plans. The Company’s
plan assets are invested in equity securities, bonds and other fixed
income securities, money market instruments and insurance contracts.
The Company’s funding policy is to contribute amounts determined
annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future
benefits in accordance with applicable law which require, among other
things, that the Company make cash contributions to an under funded
pension plan. The Company expects to contribute approximately
$15  million to its pension and other post retirement plans in
2006.

There can be no assurance that the value of the
plan assets, or the investment returns on those plan assets, will be
sufficient in the future. It is therefore possible that the Company may
be required to make significant additional cash contributions to the
plans which would reduce the cash available for other business
purposes, or that the Company will have to recognize a significant
pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the
Company.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The Company is a
worldwide supplier of consumer products, industrial tools and security
solutions for professional, industrial and consumer use. For several
years, the Company has focused on a profitable growth strategy and the
associated alteration of its portfolio of businesses. This strategy
encompasses acquisitions, divestitures and the reduction of risk
associated with certain large customer concentrations. Additionally,
the strategy reflects management’s vision to build a growth
platform in security while expanding the valuable branded tools and
hardware platforms. Execution of this strategy has improved the
profitability of operations and should engender continuing improvement
over the long-term. Significant areas of tactical emphasis related to
execution of this strategy, and associated events impacting the
Company’s financial performance in 2005 and 2004, are discussed
below.

CONTINUED PORTFOLIO TRANSITION TO SECURITY
SOLUTIONS

The Company continues to focus on becoming
a global market leader in the security industry. Annual revenues of the
Security Solutions segment have grown to $818  million, or
25% of consolidated sales, in 2005 from $105  million, or
5% of sales, in 2001. Key events pertaining to this portfolio
transition in the past two years include the
following:

•

In January  2005, U.S.
based Security Group, Inc. (‘‘Security
Group’’) was acquired for approximately $50
million. Security Group is comprised of two primary operating
companies: Sargent & Greenleaf, Inc. and The SafeMasters Co., Inc.
Sargent & Greenleaf, Inc. is a manufacturer of medium and high
security locks and locking systems for the financial, government and
retail markets. The SafeMasters Co., Inc. is a North American access
control provider offering a wide variety of physical security
installation, maintenance and repair services, with emphasis on
mechanical locking systems.


•

In May
2005, the Company completed the acquisitions of Precision Hardware,
Inc. (‘‘Precision’’) and Sielox Security
Systems Pty Ltd (‘‘Sielox’’), for a
combined purchase price of $48  million. Precision manufactures
and distributes exit devices, door closers and security hardware in the
United States and provides a complementary product offering to the
Company’s existing mechanical access business. Australian-based
Sielox specializes in the installation and servicing of electronic
security systems for new construction
projects.

•

In 2004, the acquisitions of
Blick plc (‘‘Blick’’), Frisco Bay
Industries Ltd. (‘‘Frisco Bay’’), ISR
Solutions Inc. (‘‘ISR’’), and another small
business were completed for $256  million. Blick is a leading
U.K. integrator of security systems, communication and time management
solutions for the commercial and industrial sectors. Frisco Bay is a
leading Canadian provider of security systems and equipment (including
ATM’s) for financial institutions, government agencies and major
corporations. ISR is a North American electronic security integrator,
providing the U.S. federal government and commercial customers with
access security systems design, installation and maintenance
services.

Aside from acquisition related growth, the
Company also focused on organic growth and the integration of Security
Solutions with the goal of transforming the stand alone acquired
businesses into an integrated multi-solution security service provider.
In 2005 and 2004, various process improvement initiatives were
initiated including integration of overlapping field service
organizations and implementation of certain common back office systems.
These integration efforts will continue throughout 2006 and
2007.

To assist in funding the above acquisitions and to
mitigate the risks associated with certain large customer
concentrations, the Company has disposed of the following non-strategic
businesses:

•

In December  2005, the
Company announced the decision to divest its small appliance hinge
business and its U.K. paint decorator tool business during 2006. These
businesses have combined annual sales approximating $40  million,
or 1% of consolidated annual sales. The earnings of these
businesses were negligible in 2005 and, as a consequence, their sale
will have no meaningful impact on 2006 operating profitability.
Accordingly, the results of both businesses are reported in
discontinued operations in 2005 and all prior
periods.

•

The home décor business
was sold in late 2004 for $87  million. The after-tax gain
recorded in 2004 on this transaction was $24  million. The home
décor business contributed $0.13 and $0.07 of diluted earnings
per share in 2004 and 2003, respectively, excluding the gain on sale.
Additionally, a small German paint roller business with annual sales of
approximately $20  million, and nominal earnings, was divested
with an associated $4  million loss in December  2004. Both
businesses were included in discontinued operations for 2004 and prior
periods.

•

The residential entry door
business was sold for $161  million in March  2004
generating an after-tax gain of $95  million. This business
contributed $0.13 of diluted earnings per share in 2003 while the
impact in 2004, aside from the gain on the sale, was nominal. The
results are reported as discontinued operations in 2004 and prior
periods.

DRIVE FURTHER PROFITABLE GROWTH IN BRANDED TOOLS
AND HARDWARE

While diversifying the business
portfolio through expansion into Security Solutions is important, the
Company also recognizes that its branded consumer products and
industrial tools businesses, while generally strong and profitable
today, cannot remain so without vigilant attention to growth and
vitality. Management is committed to growing these businesses through a
combination of organic and acquisition related growth strategies.
Continuously improving vitality is pursued through product development,
brand support and relentless focus on global cost competitiveness. The
following matters affected these
businesses:

•

In January  2006, the
Company completed the acquisition of Facom S.A.
(‘‘Facom’’) for 410  million euros
($486  million) which was financed with a combination of cash on
hand and debt issuance. Facom, based in France, is a leading European
manufacturer of hand and


mechanics tools with annual revenues
approximating $445  million. Facom designs, manufactures and
markets the majority of its tool product offerings to professional
automotive and industrial end users with its well-known industrial tool
brands: Facom

®

, Virax

®

and
USAG

®

. Facom operates primarily within the premium
industrial and automotive tools sector in Europe, while the
Company’s pre-existing European customer base is focused mainly
on the construction and D-I-Y
(‘‘do-it-yourself’’) channels. As a result,
the two businesses will complement each other and benefit from joint
efforts in areas such as product sourcing and procurement. The Company
anticipates fully diluted EPS accretion from this acquisition to
approximate 10 cents per share in 2006 and increase to 65 cents per
share in 2008. These estimates reflect significant acquisition-related
costs, necessary to achieve synergies, to be incurred in 2007 and 2008,
as well as the impact of inventory step-up purchase accounting in 2006.
Facom is profitable and has experienced a long history of success in
professional markets in Europe, especially in France and Italy.
Nonetheless, many of its products are subject to competitive forces
that require a significant reformation of its cost structure.
Management is committed to performing such a reformation in order to
ensure the long-term competitiveness and preservation of the Facom
franchise.

•

On November  30,
2005, National Manufacturing Co.
(‘‘National’’) was acquired for $174
million. National is a leading North American manufacturer and supplier
of builders’ hardware, marketing the majority of its products
through the two-step cooperative channel to the builder trade. National
serves over 25,000 outlets with manufacturing operations in the U.S.,
Canada and Mexico and has annual revenues of approximately $200
million. The acquisition will be nominally accretive to earnings in
2006 and accretive to fully-diluted earnings per share by approximately
10 cents in 2007.

•

The acquisitions of
CST/Berger for $64  million in 2004 and Rolatape (a small bolt-on
to CST) in early 2005 expanded the industrial tools product lines to
include laser and optical leveling and measuring equipment for
distribution in the professional survey, construction and industrial
channels. Other small CST/Berger related acquisitions were completed in
late 2005 for $3  million.

•

The
Company streamlined its commercialization process with increased focus
on product innovation. This reduced new product development cycle time
significantly and resulted in 350 new SKUs that were successfully
launched in 2005 and will continue through 2006. Successful new
products include the AntiVibe

®

Hammer,
Quickslide

®

Knife and FatMax

®

Hacksaw.

REINVIGORATE THE STANLEY
BRAND

The Stanley

®

brand is
recognized as one of America’s greatest brands and is one of the
Company’s most valuable assets. Brand support was increased
during 2005 and 2004, including television advertising campaigns
associated with new product roll-outs, continued NASCAR racing
sponsorships as well as more print and web-based advertising promotions
that generated approximately one billion brand impressions annually.
These advertising and marketing campaigns yielded strong results as
evidenced by various metrics: web traffic increase of 60%; sales
lead increase of 27%; brand awareness increase of 18% and
intent to buy increase of 10%. The Stanley

®

brand
had the highest unaided hand tools brand awareness in the United States
for 2005 and 2004, and was the only brand to show improvement in these
surveys in each of the past four years.

INSTITUTIONALIZE THE
STANLEY FULFILLMENT SYSTEM

The Company continued to
roll-out its Stanley Fulfillment System
(‘‘SFS’’), which is a continuous
operational improvement process committed to increasing customer and
shareowner value. SFS’s core disciplines consist of striving to
achieve perfect quality, service excellence, optimal cost, and
environmental health & safety. The Company applies SFS to many
aspects of its business including procurement, maximizing customer fill
rates, acquisition integration, and business processes. The SFS program
helped to mitigate the impact of material price inflation that was
experienced in recent years and also to reduce selling, general &
administrative expense (‘‘SG&A’’) as a
percentage of sales during the past five years.


The Company expects to continue to
execute the above strategies during 2006 with its primary focus on the
successful integration of the recent Facom Tools and National Hardware
acquisitions.

Aside
from the strategic commentary above, two other matters having a
significant impact on the Company’s results were inflation and
currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The Company has been
negatively impacted by commodity and freight inflation over the past
two years which has increased costs by approximately $110
million. During such period, the Company has been able to recover
approximately 70% of the cost increase through pricing actions
and various cost reduction initiatives. As described in more detail in
the Results of Operations section below, the Company expects to be
negatively impacted by inflation during 2006 by approximately $15
– $20  million, and has plans to offset this impact through
pricing and other actions.

In recent years, the
strengthening of foreign currencies had a favorable impact on the
translation of foreign currency-denominated operating results into U.S.
dollars. It is estimated that the favorable impact of foreign currency
translation, including acquired companies, contributed $0.04, $0.12 and
$0.13 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. This impact was principally from the
Canadian dollar and Asian currencies in 2005, and European currencies
in 2004 and 2003. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
relative to the U.S. dollar may have a significant impact on future
earnings, either positive or negative.

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

Below is a summary of the Company’s
operating results at the consolidated level, followed by an overview of
business segment performance.

Net Sales:

Net
sales from continuing operations were $3.285  billion in 2005, as
compared to $2.997  billion in 2004, a 10% increase.
Acquisitions contributed 6% or $167  million of the sales
increase. Organic sales increased 4% driven by 2% volume
growth, 1% favorable foreign currency and a 1% positive
pricing impact. The organic volume growth was attributed to strong
Consumer Products demand based on successful consumer hand tool and
garage storage new product introductions, as well as increases in
several Industrial Tools businesses, principally industrial mechanics
tools, hydraulic tools, leveling / measuring tools and fastening
systems. Favorable foreign currency translation in Canada and Asia
increased net sales by 1%.

Net sales from
continuing operations were $2.997  billion in 2004, as compared
to $2.486  billion in 2003, a 21% increase. Excluding
acquisitions, organic sales increased 11% driven by 6%
volume growth, improved pricing and favorable foreign currency impact.
The volume growth was due to: increased industrial tool demand from
favorable market conditions; improved order fulfillment and execution
in several businesses; strong consumer hand and mechanics tool demand
from home center and mass merchant customers; and increased Security
Solutions revenues primarily due to automated door products reflecting
a major upgrade project at a large customer. The 2004 net sales volume
performance was achieved in a 52-week reporting period versus a 53-week
reporting period in 2003. Favorable foreign currency translation,
primarily European, increased net sales by 2%. Price increased
3%, mainly as a result of the Company actively pursuing
increases to offset commodity inflation. Other pricing actions
associated with more effective price management routines resulted in an
additional $20 – $25  million of benefit.

Significant Charges and Credits:

In 2005, the
Company recorded a $5  million tax benefit pertaining to the
execution of tax planning strategies enabling the reduction of a
previously provided valuation allowance on future utilization of
certain prior year European net operating losses. Also, a $17
million tax benefit was recorded arising from the final settlement of
various tax contingencies based on the resolution of income tax audits.
In conjunction with the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, the Company repatriated $250  million in foreign earnings
and recorded $16  million of tax expense pertaining to such
repatriation.

In 2004, the Company recorded $4
million of pre-tax restructuring costs in connection with specific
personnel actions to streamline/reposition certain organizations,
$4  million of impairment charges


primarily associated with a 2004 information
system strategy decision, and a $2  million provision for
litigation. Additionally, an $8  million tax credit was recorded
as a result of favorable resolutions of tax audits, increased
utilization of foreign net operating loss carry forwards and specific
acquisition tax-planning activities.

In 2003, the Company
recorded $108  million of pre-tax restructuring costs, impairment
charges, and other exit costs in connection with the Operation 15
initiative, relating to the Mac Direct exit ($53  million),
distribution facilities ($13  million) and other items
($42  million). Certain expenses totaling $8  million
related to the retirement of the Company’s former Chairman and
CEO were recorded in addition to Operation 15 charges. Also, in the
first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded $3  million in
restructuring reserves for initiatives pertaining to the further
reduction of its cost structure, primarily for severance-related
obligations. These charges were classified within the 2003 Consolidated
Statement of Operations as follows: (i) Cost of sales —
$20  million; (ii) SG&A and Provision for doubtful accounts
— $37  million; (iii) Other-net — $10
million; and (iv) Restructuring and asset impairment charges —
$52  million. Additionally, the 2003 income taxes reflect
favorable foreign tax developments that resulted in a credit of
$2  million.

Gross Profit:

The Company
reported gross profit from continuing operations of $1.181
billion, or 36% of net sales, in 2005, compared to $1.104
billion, or 37% of net sales, in the prior year. The businesses
acquired increased gross profit by $52  million. The remaining
$25  million improvement was primarily attributed to the increase
in organic sales volume and continued benefits of the Stanley
Fulfillment System. As a percentage of sales, the year over year gross
margin rate decline primarily stems from unfavorable mix and cost
absorption in the fastening business, and to a lesser extent the impact
of recently acquired businesses which possess lower gross margin
percentages until integration synergies are realized. During 2005,
there was carryover of commodity inflation from 2004 which resulted in
approximately $40  million of additional costs that were mostly
recovered through favorable pricing actions. Although steel costs have
stabilized from prior year levels, energy costs and non-ferrous
commodities continue to escalate and the Company expects such inflation
to increase 2006 costs by approximately $15 – $20  million,
which management plans to mitigate through various customer pricing
actions and cost reduction initiatives.

Gross profit from
continuing operations was $1.104  billion, or 37% of net
sales, in 2004, compared to $850  million, or 34% of net
sales, in the prior year. The businesses acquired increased gross
profit by $105  million. The remaining $149  million
improvement was primarily attributed to increased sales volume
discussed previously, gross margin rate improvement, and $20
million of inventory losses recorded in 2003 related to the termination
of the MacDirect distribution model and the planned consolidation of
two major distribution facilities in conjunction with Operation 15. The
gross margin rate improvement was attributable to the carryover benefit
of 2003 restructuring programs, volume leverage, favorable pricing and
improved product mix. These benefits were partially offset by higher
steel costs and other inflation. The Company experienced a significant
impact from unusually high levels of commodity price inflation
(particularly steel) in 2004. The Company had actively pursued price
increases in many business channels to partially offset this negative
impact. The effect of commodity inflation and freight increases was
approximately $75  million in 2004, of which approximately
60% was offset with related price increases to customers.

SG&A expenses:

Selling, general and
administrative expenses from continuing operations, inclusive of the
provision for doubtful accounts, were $737  million or 22%
of net sales in 2005, compared to $691  million, or 23% of
net sales, in the prior year. The increase of $46  million mainly
pertains to acquired businesses that increased costs by $34
million, and $14  million of increased brand support. Excluding
acquisitions, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 50 basis
points compared with 2004 levels despite the higher brand support
expense due to sales volume leverage, lower Sarbanes-Oxley compliance
costs and effective cost controls.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses from continuing operations, inclusive of the
provision for doubtful accounts, were $691  million or 23%
of net sales in 2004, compared to $613  million or 25% of
net sales, in the prior year. The increase of $78  million was
primarily attributed to acquired businesses that increased costs by
$62  million, higher business portfolio SG&A spending levels
in connection with


the strong organic net sales increase,
increased funding for brand support, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs,
and foreign currency translation. Additional factors impacting this
comparison were accounts receivable losses of $25  million which
related to the exiting of the MacDirect distribution model and
$8  million of costs pertaining to the retirement of the
Company's former CEO, both of which were recorded in
2003.

Interest and Other-net:

Net interest
expense from continuing operations in 2005 was $34  million,
consistent with 2004 levels. Interest expense was held fairly constant
in a period of rising interest rates through the maintenance of overall
lower debt levels during most of 2005 and application of effective
hedging strategies.

Net interest expense from continuing
operations in 2004 was $34  million, an increase of $6
million over 2003. This increase was driven by higher borrowings
associated with the acquisitions discussed previously, partially offset
by lower interest rates on a year over year basis.

Other-net from continuing operations represented $48
million of expense in 2005, an increase of $2  million over 2004.
The slight increase was primarily driven by $6  million of higher
intangible asset amortization associated with acquisition activity
partially offset by lower foreign currency
losses.

Other-net from continuing operations represented
$46  million of expense in 2004, an increase of $7  million
from expense of $39  million in 2003. The increase is primarily
the result of increased intangible amortization expense of $10
million associated with recent acquisitions. Additionally, there was a
significant cost increase and decrease which offset one another
— a $10  million increase in currency losses from 2003
levels was offset by reduced losses on the MacAdvantage finance program
in 2004 versus 2003.

Income Taxes:

The
Company’s effective income tax rate from continuing operations
for 2005 was 24% as compared to 27% for 2004 and
25% for 2003.

The decrease in the effective income
tax rate in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects a higher proportion of
taxable income in countries with lower statutory rates, as well as the
recording of a $5  million tax benefit pertaining to the
execution of tax planning strategies enabling the reduction of a
previously provided valuation allowance on future utilization of
certain prior year European net operating losses. Also, a $17
million tax benefit was recorded arising from the final settlement of
various tax contingencies based on the resolution of income tax audits
in 2005. In October  2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(the ‘‘Act’’) was signed into law. The Act
creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent deduction for certain
dividends received from controlled foreign corporations. During 2005,
the Company repatriated $250  million in foreign earnings and
recorded $16  million of tax expense pertaining to the
repatriation.

The increase in the effective tax rate in
2004 compared to 2003 relates to 2003 Operation 15 charges which were
predominately U.S. based and favorable foreign tax developments that
reduced income taxes by $2  million in 2003. Also affecting the
comparison is an $8  million credit to income taxes that was
recorded in 2004 as a result of favorable resolutions of tax audits,
increased utilization of foreign net operating loss carry forwards and
specific acquisition tax-planning
activities.

Discontinued Operations:

In 2005,
the Company announced the planned sale of two small businesses: the
U.K. paint decorator tool business and a small appliance hinge
business. Accordingly, their results have been classified in
discontinued operations in all periods. The operations of these
two small held for sale businesses, along with the resolution of tax
and other matters associated with the 2004 divestitures, resulted in a
net loss from discontinued operations of $2  million in 2005. Net
earnings from discontinued operations were $130  million in 2004,
reflecting a $95  million net gain on the March  2004 sale
of the residential entry door business, a $24  million net gain
on the December  2004 divestiture of the home décor
business, a $4  million net loss on the sale of a small German
paint roller business, as well as the operating results of these
discontinued operations.  Net earnings from discontinued
operations were $20  million in 2003 based on the operating
results of the above businesses, principally residential entry door and
home décor.


Business Segment Results

The Company’s reportable segments are an
aggregation of businesses that have similar products and services,
among other factors. The Company utilizes operating profit, which is
defined as net sales minus cost of sales and SG&A, inclusive of the
provision for doubtful accounts and allocated corporate and common
expenses; and operating profit as a percentage of net sales to assess
the profitability of each segment. Segment operating profit excludes
interest income, interest expense, other-net, restructuring charges and
asset impairments and income tax expense. Refer to Note O Restructuring
and Asset Impairments and Note G Goodwill, Customer Relationships and
Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for the amount of restructuring charges and asset
impairments, and intangibles amortization expense, respectively,
attributable to each segment. The Company's operations are
classified into three business segments: Consumer Products, Industrial
Tools, and Security Solutions. The Consumer Products segment
manufactures and markets hand tools, consumer mechanics tools, storage
units, and hardware. These products are sold to retailers (including
home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and lumber yards) as
well as through third party distributors. The Industrial Tools segment
manufactures and markets professional mechanic tools and storage
systems, pneumatic tools and fasteners, assembly tool systems,
specialty tools, hydraulic tools and accessories, and electronic
leveling and measuring tools. These products are sold to customers and
distributed either directly or through third party distributors. The
Security Solutions segment manufactures, integrates and markets
automatic doors, door locking systems, door closers and exit devices,
commercial hardware and security access control and surveillance
systems, primarily through various direct sales forces in the U.S.,
Canada and the U.K.

Consumer
Products

:

Consumer
Products net sales from continuing operations in 2005 represented a
5% increase from 2004. Of this 5% increase, the
November  2005 National acquisition contributed 1% while
organic volume increased 3% driven by strength in the hand tools
and consumer storage business associated with successful new product
introductions. The effects of currency and pricing contributed equally
to the remaining 1% increase. Solid organic sales growth was
achieved despite an unanticipated inventory correction by certain large
North American customers in December  2005 which negatively
impacted sales by approximately $30  million versus normal
levels. These customer inventory corrections continued to impact sales
in January 2006 as expected. The customer actions were broad-based and
generally not a result of performance issues with the Company’s
products. However, it is expected that normal ordering patterns by
these large North American customers will be realized in due course as
the retail sell through of products to the end user customers continues
to be strong and is outpacing shipments to the home centers. In
February 2006, orders from and shipments to these customers were robust
and more consistent with the Company's retail sell through
levels. Operating margin improved 50 basis points primarily due to
leverage associated with the increase in sales
volume.

Consumer Products net sales from continuing
operations in 2004 represented a 12% increase from 2003, driven
by the aforementioned strength in home center and mass merchant
channels in the U.S. and favorable currency impacts in Europe. Of this
12% increase, volume represented 7% which was driven by
growth in the hand tools, consumer mechanics tools and storage
businesses as a result of improved order fulfillment, increased brand
support, and higher market demand, which was partially offset by volume
declines in the hardware business. Currency contributed 4% and
pricing 1% of the net sales increase. Operating margin improved
60 basis points primarily due to improved operating leverage from
higher sales volumes, pricing, and favorable product mix; however these
factors were partially offset by the previously mentioned commodity
cost inflation (primarily steel and resin), increased brand support and
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs. Additionally, 2003 Consumer Products
operating profit was impacted by $3  million in Operation 15
charges previously mentioned.


Industrial
Tools:

Industrial
Tools net sales increased 6% from 2004. The carryover effect
from the 2004 CST/Berger and related 2005 acquisitions contributed
nearly 1% of the sales increase. The 5% organic sales
increase was comprised of 3% volume and 2% price. Sales
volume rose on continued strong demand in the industrial mechanics
tools, hydraulic tools, laser leveling tools, and storage businesses,
and to a lesser extent fastening systems. These volume gains were
partially offset by declines in the Mac tools and assembly technologies
businesses. Industrial mechanics tools’ increase in volume was
driven by share gains achieved from new product introductions and
improved customer service. Hydraulic tools also benefited from new
product introductions as well as higher product demand associated with
the steel scrap market which was driven by the strong global demand for
steel. Laser leveling tools continued to increase its market share in
the U.S. and European professional markets due to new product
offerings. Although demand began to slow during the latter half of
2005, fastening systems achieved moderate sales growth during 2005
based on demand from the U.S. construction and industrial channels
along with the success of innovative nail products. The storage
business increase in volume was driven by the successful launch of a
vertical lift module automated storage and retrieval system as well as
strong demand experienced in the industrial, heavy truck, and
automotive dealership markets. Assembly technologies was affected by
weakness in the U.S. auto industry, as the ‘‘Big
3’’ automakers continued to reduce capital expenditures
in conjunction with other cost reduction initiatives. Mac tools sales
fell due to a decline in the number of distributors in 2005 compared to
2004 as dealer attrition outpaced recruiting efforts. However, the
average sales per Mac tools’ distributor was up 4% versus
2004 and operating margin improved slightly. Operating profit in 2005
was $136  million or 9.9% of net sales, up slightly
compared to $133  million, or 10.3% of net sales, in 2004.
The 40 basis point decline in the operating margin rate, despite the
sales volume increase, was primarily due to increased freight costs, as
well as unfavorable mix and cost absorption in the fastening business
where manufacturing volume was lower in 2005 compared to 2004 on
improved inventory management.

Industrial Tools net sales
increased 18% in 2004 from 2003. Excluding the CST/Berger
acquisition, organic sales increased 12%. Volume represented
6% of the organic sales increase; and price and currency were
4% and 2%, respectively. This organic volume improvement
was the result of better economic conditions, improved management
execution in several businesses and improved order fulfillment related
to industrial mechanic tool, assembly tool, specialty tool, and
hydraulic tool products. Mac tools net sales decreased 4% as
sluggish market conditions impacted this business in the fourth quarter
of 2004 combined with traditional distributor additions and higher
route average sales only partially offsetting the anticipated decline
from the previous year's MacDirect exit. The majority of the
price increase was due to the Company’s actions in response to
commodity inflation as previously discussed. The significant
improvement in the 2004 operating profit and margin rate is the result
of charges in 2003 totaling $52  million mainly from receivable
and inventory losses associated with the MacDirect exit, as well as
higher sales volume, substantial improvement in the margin performances
of Mac Tools and industrial mechanics tools as a result of the
carryover benefits from prior year restructuring programs, and the
acquisition of CST/Berger. These favorable factors were partially
offset by the previously mentioned commodity cost inflation, as
approximately two-thirds of the total Company’s commodity
inflation (net of price recovery) impacted this segment, and
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs.


Security
Solutions:

Security
Solutions sales increased 24% in 2005. Excluding acquisitions,
organic sales increased 2%. Sales volume and favorable foreign
currency each represented 1% of the organic increase. The
increase in organic volume was driven by the North American mechanical
access and electronic security integration businesses, offset by
declines in the North American automatic door and Blick U.K. security
businesses. The strong sales volume achieved by the mechanical access
business was driven by increased demand from its national accounts
based on the continued ability to provide a diversified product
offering to such customers, while the North American security
integration business benefited from improved coordination in sales and
marketing activities due to the reorganization of the system
integration commercial team in early 2005. The decline in Blick was
attributable to overall softness in the U.K. economy, while the
automatic doors business was negatively impacted by the non-recurrence
of a major project upgrade at a large customer as compared with 2004.
Acquisitions contributed $17  million of operating profit. The
operating margin rate decrease is primarily attributed to unfavorable
mix as a result of a higher proportion of electronic access sales as
compared to mechanical access, as well as the impact of recent
acquisitions as integration synergies were not yet fully achieved and
there was unfavorable impact from non-recurring inventory step-up costs
in purchase accounting. However, the second half 2005 operating margin
was 15.8% compared to 14.4% in the first half, reflecting
the benefit of various cost reduction initiatives including headcount
reductions at several of the businesses, progress in the integration of
field service organizations and back office systems, and the continued
roll-out of the Stanley Fulfillment System to recently acquired
businesses. Based on the relative size of the Security Solutions
segment compared to the remainder of the business portfolio and the
dynamic nature of its growth activities, as well as the seasonal nature
of this business, management expects continued operating margin
volatility on a quarterly basis. However, management also believes that
this segment will continue to produce above Company average operating
margins when viewed over the course of several
quarters.

Security Solutions sales increased 44% in
2004. Excluding acquisitions (primarily Blick, Frisco Bay and ISR),
organic sales increased 6%. Sales volume represented 4%
of the organic increase and price was 2%. The organic volume
improvement was due to strength in the supply and service of automatic
commercial door systems in access technologies. Best Access sales
volume was virtually unchanged compared to 2003 levels while incoming
orders increased, reflecting a shift in mix toward longer order cycle
electronic access systems. The operating profit increase is primarily
attributed to the impact of 2004 acquisitions. Operating margin was
relatively flat versus 2003, primarily attributable to favorable
business mix and pricing actions with customers, which were offset by
increased commodity inflation, field productivity issues at Best
Access, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs and strategic consulting
expenditures.


RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES

At December  31,  2005, the restructuring and
asset impairment reserve balance was $5  million, which the
Company expects to be fully expended by the end of 2006. A summary of
the Company’s restructuring reserves for the years ended
January  1,  2005 to December  31,  2005 is as
follows:

For
the three years ended December  31,  2005, 27 facilities
have been closed as a result of restructuring initiatives. In 2005,
2004 and 2003, approximately 219, 160, and 1,100 employees have been
terminated as a result of restructuring initiatives, respectively.
Severance payments of $6  million, $4  million and
$18  million and other exit costs of $1  million, $4
million, and $10  million were made in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Write-offs of impaired assets were $2  million,
$11  million and $18  million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Acquisition
Related:

Integration of certain acquisitions requires
reduction of redundant personnel, closure of facilities, and other
restructuring actions related to the acquired businesses. In such
cases, a restructuring accrual is recorded for actions identified in
integration strategy plans initially developed by the Company as of the
acquisition date, with a resulting increase to goodwill. As integration
strategies are executed, the Company monitors the previously
established restructuring accruals and makes adjustments to such
accruals to the extent actual expenditures differ from the estimated
accruals. Adjustments recorded to previously established restructuring
accruals until the time integration plans are fully executed, not to
exceed one year from date of original acquisition, are reflected in the
final goodwill amount included in the purchase price allocation.
Adjustments made subsequent to the finalization of integration
strategies, or after one year from the date of original acquisition,
are reflected in the Company’s results of operations if
increases to the accruals are required, while decreases in such
accruals are appropriately applied against goodwill.

In
January  2006, the Company announced a cost reduction initiative
relating primarily to the severance of approximately 540 employees
across multiple businesses. The majority of the cost reduction actions
will be executed in the first quarter of 2006 providing approximately
$40  million of cost savings in 2006. A charge totaling
approximately $16  million is expected to be recorded in 2006 in
connection with this initiative.

The Company anticipates
approximately $30  million – $40  million of cash
expenditures will be incurred between 2006 and 2007 in relation to
integration of the Facom and National acquisitions. The majority of
this restructuring is expected to be reflected in the purchase price
allocation.


FINANCIAL
CONDITION

Liquidity, Sources and Uses of
Capital

:

The Company’s primary sources of
liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under
various credit facilities.

Operating and Investing
Activities:

The Company has historically generated strong cash
flows from operations. In 2005, cash flow from operations was
$362  million, relatively flat as compared to $372  million
in 2004. In 2004, cash flow from operations was $372  million, as
compared to $464  million in 2003. Working capital improvements
were $45  million higher in 2003 as compared with 2004. In
addition, in 2003 there were favorable impacts of $57  million
for income tax deferrals and refunds, as well as approximately
$40  million in cash proceeds from the sale of the Mac tools
distributor financing portfolio which did not recur in 2004. These
items were partially offset by improved net earnings from continuing
operations and lower cash payments related to restructuring and other
charges in 2004 versus 2003.

Capital expenditures were
$68  million in 2005, $55  million in 2004, and $39
million in 2003. The increase in 2005 capital expenditures versus 2004
was due to new product introductions, information system upgrades and
plant investments in China and Thailand. The Company incurred higher
capital expenditures in 2004 compared to 2003 for investment in various
plants including manufacturing productivity projects, movement of
production to low cost countries, and increased costs for software
development and acquisitions. The Company expects future capital
expenditures to increase approximately in proportion to its sales
growth.

Free cash flow, as defined in the following
table, was $294  million in 2005 and $317  million in 2004,
considerably exceeding net earnings from continuing operations in a
period of continued strong sales volume growth. The Company believes
free cash flow is an important measure of its liquidity, as well as its
ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to
shareowners.

Based
on its demonstrated ability to generate free cash flow and its strong
debt to capital ratio at December  31,  2005, the Company
believes it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to its
shareholders' advantage through a combination of acquisitions,
share repurchases, dividends and debt repayment.

In 2005,
acquisition spending totaled $287  million, principally for the
National Hardware, Security Group, and Precision businesses as
previously mentioned. As part of its portfolio diversification shift,
the Company received $205  million in net proceeds from sales of
the residential entry door and home décor businesses in 2004,
and disbursed $301  million for business acquisitions. In 2005,
the $21  million of remaining taxes due on the gain from these
business sales were paid. Pursuant to its profitable growth strategy,
the Company will continue to assess its current business portfolio for
disposition opportunities and make acquisitions in favored markets
while minimizing the risk associated with large customer
concentrations. Currently, the Company expects to complete additional
2006 acquisitions requiring funding of approximately $100 –
$200  million, aside from Facom which was acquired for
$486  million on January  1,  2006. However, if the
opportunity arises to acquire a target that meets strategic objectives
at an attractive price, management will consider exceeding this
anticipated 2006 acquisition spending level, within the constraints of
its ongoing commitment to maintain upper-tier investment grade credit
ratings.

Financing Activities:

In
November  2005, the Company consummated a Section 144A offering,
with registration rights, of $450  million of Enhanced Trust
Preferred Securities (‘‘ETPS Debt’’)
through its unconsolidated trust subsidiary, The Stanley Works Capital
Trust I (‘‘the Trust’’). Contemporaneously,
the Company borrowed the proceeds of the ETPS offering from the Trust
by issuing $450  million of junior subordinated debt securities
payable to the Trust. The net proceeds were used to partially fund


the acquisitions of National and Facom which
closed on November  30,  2005 and January  1,
2006, respectively. These securities and underlying junior subordinated
debt securities (collectively, the
‘‘securities’’) feature a 5 year fixed rate
period ending December  1,  2010 and floating rate period
ending December  1,  2045. The fixed coupon was set at
5.902%. The obligations, tenor and terms of the ETPS mirror
those of the junior subordinated debt securities. The securities can be
redeemed by the Company on or after December  1,  2010
without penalty for early payment.

Payments on long-term
debt amounted to $72  million in 2005, $154  million in
2004 and $18  million in 2003. Payments in 2004 reflect the
maturity of $120  million of debt on March  1,  2004.
Net proceeds from short term borrowings amounted to cash inflows of
$103  million in 2005 and $20  million in 2004, and a cash
outflow of $141  million in 2003. The increase in 2005 was
primarily attributed to commercial paper issued to fund the 2005
acquisitions aside from National.

In 2003, the Company
repurchased 3.9  million shares of common stock and agreed to
settle the remainder of its equity hedge through the repurchase of
4.1  million shares over the succeeding four years. The
3.9  million share repurchase was made with $100  million
of cash and increased commercial paper borrowings while the 4.1
million share repurchase involved $113  million of term debt. No
open market purchase of shares occurred. In 2005, the Company paid
$71  million to purchase the remaining 2.5  million shares
of common stock, which settled the remaining portion of the equity
hedge.

The Company’s debt to capital ratio was
42.4% at the end of 2005, 32.1% at the end of 2004 and
43.2% at the end of 2003. Reflecting the credit protection
measures that are incorporated into the terms of the $450
million ETPS, the debt to capital ratio of the Company is more fairly
represented by apportioning 50% of the ETPS issuance to equity
when making the calculation. The resulting debt to capital ratio from
this apportionment is 33.5%. This adjustment is consistent with
the treatment accorded these securities by internationally recognized
bond ratings agencies.

The Company increased its cash
dividend per common share to $1.14 in 2005 which resulted in $6
million of additional dividend payments compared to 2004. Dividends per
common share increased 5.5% in 2005, 4.9% in 2004 and
4.0% in 2003.

In January  2006, the Company
announced the commencement of a stock repurchase program whereby
approximately $200  million will be expended to repurchase
outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. The repurchase
program is expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and
provide a 2006 fully diluted earnings per share benefit of
approximately $0.10 – $0.15. The Company will continue to assess
the possibility of repurchasing more of its outstanding common stock,
based on a number of factors including the level of acquisition
activity, the market price of the Company’s common stock and the
current financial condition of the Company.

In 2005, the
Company amended its long-term (multi-year) $400  million credit
facility by increasing the facility size to $550  million and
adding a multi currency sub-limit of $250  million available in
Euros or Pound Sterling. This long-term credit facility matures in
October  2009. In addition, the Company has short-term lines of
credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating $184  million, of
which $155  million was available at December  31,
2005. Short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal. Of the
$734  million aggregate credit lines, $400  million is
allocated to support the Company’s commercial paper program. In
addition to these lines of credit, the Company maintains a facility
designed for the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable
for purposes of additional liquidity. As of December  31,
2005, the Company’s maximum available funds under this
arrangement were $123  million, of which $16  million was
utilized.

In 2003, the Company filed a Shelf Registration
in the amount of $900  million. At December  31,
2005, the Shelf Registration was unutilized. This filing represents a
prospectus which, if accompanied by a prospectus supplement, would
allow the Company to offer, issue and sell, together or separately,
debt, equity and other securities.

The Company also has
numerous assets, predominantly vehicles and equipment, under a one-year
term renewable U.S. master personal property lease. Residual value
obligations, which approximate the fair value of the related assets,
under this master lease were $25.7  million at December
31,  2005. The Company does not anticipate any material
liabilities associated with these transactions.

MARKET RISK

Market risk is the
potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the
fair value of financial instruments. The Company is exposed to market
risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates
and commodity prices. Exposure to foreign currency risk results because
the Company, through its global businesses, enters into transactions
and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. The
Company’s predominant exposures are in European, Canadian and
Asian currencies, including the Chinese Renminbi
(‘‘RMB’’) and the Taiwan Dollar. Certain
cross-currency trade flows arising from sales and procurement
activities as well as affiliate cross-border activity are consolidated
and netted prior to obtaining risk protection, primarily purchased
options. The Company is thus able to capitalize on its global
positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures to
reduce the cost of purchasing protection. At times, the Company also
enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce
the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency
denominated receivables and payables, predominately affiliate
transactions. Gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset
the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures, assets and
liabilities being hedged. Management determines the nature and extent
of currency hedging activities, and in certain cases, may elect to
allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged. The Company has
also entered into several cross-currency interest rate swaps, to
provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries
and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service
requirements. Sensitivity to foreign currency exposure risk from these
financial instruments at the end of 2005 would have been immaterial
based on the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical
10% adverse movement in all currencies. The Company follows risk
management policies in executing derivative financial instrument
transactions, and does not use such instruments for speculative or
hedging purposes.

On July  21,  2005, China
announced it will allow the RMB fluctuate within a very tight band (+/-
..3% around weighted average prior day close) thereby effectively
adopting a managed float and ending its


decade-old valuation de facto peg to the
U.S. Dollar (‘‘USD’’). The initial
appreciation was 2%. Besides the initial move, the effect of
that policy shift during 2005 was negligible as total appreciation of
the RMB versus the USD at year end amounted to only
2.6%. The Company sources significant products from China
and other Asian low cost countries for resale in other
regions. To the extent the RMB or these other currencies
appreciate with respect to the USD, the Company may experience cost
increases on such purchases. While the present 3%
appreciation of the RMB should not generate material cost increases for
RMB denominated purchases, further appreciation of this or other
currencies utilized for procurement could adversely affect
profitability. In the event significant RMB or other currency
appreciation occurs, the Company would initiate customer pricing or
other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases, but
it is possible such actions would not fully offset the potential
unfavorable impact.

The Company’s exposure to
interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations,
short-term investments, and derivative financial instruments employed
in the management of its debt portfolio. The debt portfolio is managed
to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of
borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as
well as interest rate swaps, and cross-currency swaps. The
Company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its
floating rate debt in the U.S. and Europe and is fairly represented by
changes in LIBOR and EURIBOR rates. At December  31,  2005,
the result of a hypothetical two percentage point increase in
short-term LIBOR and EURIBOR rates would not have resulted in a
material impact on the pre-tax profit of the Company.

The
Company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses,
particularly certain base metals (aluminum, copper, zinc and steel),
and energy used in the production of finished goods. Generally,
commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial
instruments, but instead are actively managed through customer pricing
actions and procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives. In
2004 the Company experienced around $75  million of commodity and
energy inflation, especially steel, of which approximately 60%
was offset with related price increases to customers.  In 2005
the Company experienced approximately $40  million of commodity
and energy inflation, most of which was recovered through favorable
pricing actions. Such inflation is expected to increase costs by
an estimated $15 – $20  million in 2006, which management
plans to mitigate through various customer pricing actions and cost
reduction initiatives. If commodity prices fluctuated to reach
new historical high levels, similar to those experienced in 2004, the
Company’s exposure could increase by $40 – $50
million above the current expected levels for 2006. In that
unlikely event, the Company would pursue pricing and other actions to
limit the net impact from inflation to an amount around or below the
approximate $30  million unfavorable inflation impact, net of
pricing actions, experienced in 2004. An unlikely change of this
magnitude would reflect external factors that would impact other
companies in our industry as well as the broader
economy.

Fluctuations in the fair value of the
Company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense
as discussed in the U.S. Pension and ESOP section of Management
Discussion and Analysis.

Sales to The Home Depot amounted
to 12% of 2005 consolidated net sales from continuing
operations. The Company has other significant customers, particularly
home centers and major retailers, though individually there are no
others that exceed 10% of consolidated sales. The loss or
material reduction of business from any such significant customer could
have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of
operations and cash flows, until either such customers were replaced or
the Company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss
of business.

The Company has access to financial resources
and borrowing capabilities around the world. There are no material
instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment
requirements due to a change in credit rating, and no significantly
restrictive covenants. The Company believes that its strong financial
position, operating cash flows, committed long-term credit facilities
and borrowing capacity provide the financial flexibility necessary to
continue its record of annual dividend payments, to invest in the
routine needs of its businesses, to make strategic acquisitions and to
fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy.


OTHER
MATTERS

ENVIRONMENTAL

The Company incurs
costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and
regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of
previously contaminated sites. Future laws and regulations are expected
to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the
Company’s expenditures related to routine environmental
matters.

The Company accrues for anticipated costs
associated with investigatory and remediation efforts in accordance
with appropriate accounting guidelines which address probability and
the ability to reasonably estimate future costs. The liabilities are
reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation
efforts and their costs can be better estimated. Subject to the
imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company
believes that any sum it may pay in connection with environmental
matters in excess of the amounts recorded will not have a materially
adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or
liquidity. Refer to Note S Contingencies of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
environmental liabilities and related cash flows.

U.S.
PENSION AND ESOP

As detailed in Note M Employee Benefit Plans
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has
an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (‘‘ESOP’’)
under which the ongoing U.S. defined contribution and 401(K) plans are
funded. Overall ESOP expense is affected by the market value of Stanley
stock on the monthly dates when shares are released. In 2005, the
market value of shares released averaged $46.41 per share and the net
ESOP expense was $2  million. In 2004, the market value of shares
released averaged $43.20 per share and the net ESOP expense was
$2  million. In 2003, the market value of shares released
averaged $29.25 per share and the net ESOP expense was $9
million. ESOP expense may vary in the future as the market value of the
Company’s common stock fluctuates.

The Company
provides a 5% guaranteed rate of return on participant
contributions made to the tax deferred savings plan 401(K) prior to
July  1998 when all contributions were invested in Stanley common
stock. The value of the shares purchased by participants prior to
July  1998 along with the 5% cumulative guaranteed rate of
return on Stanley common stock is known as an Investment Protection
Account (‘‘IPA’’). Beginning in July
1998 the investment options for plan participant contributions were
enhanced to include a variety of investment funds in addition to the
Company’s common stock, and there is no guaranteed rate of
return to participants on any contributions made after that time. The
IPA guarantee is included in the actuarial valuation of the ongoing
U.S. pension plan. Payments related to the IPA guarantees, if they have
any value, would be made to participants over a period of many years
generally as they retire. In the event the market value of Stanley
common stock declines below $43.59 (which is the stock price at which
there was a settlement of this liability) additional costs may be
triggered by the IPA benefit guarantee.

NEW ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

Refer to Note A Significant Accounting Policies of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of
new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the
Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial
position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
ESTIMATES

Preparation of the Company’s financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of
the Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note A
Significant Accounting Policies. Management believes the most complex
and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to
make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty.
The most significant areas involving management estimates are described
below. Actual results in these areas could differ from
management’s estimates.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL
ACCOUNTS    The Company’s estimate for its allowance for
doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods.
The amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to
determine the total amount reserved. First, the Company evaluates
specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an
inability to meet financial obligations, such as bankruptcy. In these
cases, the Company uses its judgment, based on the


best available facts and circumstances, to
record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to
reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These
specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional
information is received. Second, a reserve is established for all
customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivables aging
categories. These percentages are based on historical collection and
write-off experience.

If circumstances change, for
example, the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a material
adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its
financial obligation to the Company, estimates of the recoverability of
receivable amounts due could be reduced.

INVENTORIES
— LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, SLOW MOVING AND OBSOLETE    U.S.
inventories are predominantly valued at the lower of LIFO cost or
market. The calculation of LIFO reserves, and therefore the net
inventory valuation, is affected by inflation and deflation in
inventory components. The Company ensures all inventory is valued at
the lower of cost or market, and continually reviews the carrying value
of discontinued product lines and stock-keeping-units
(‘‘SKUs’’) to determine that these items
are properly valued. The Company also continually evaluates the
composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete and/or slow-moving
inventories. Inventory items identified as obsolete and/or slow-moving
are evaluated to determine if reserves are required. The Company
identifies these inventories and assesses the ability to dispose of
them at a price greater than cost. If it is determined that cost is
less than market value, then cost is used for inventory valuation. If
market value is less than cost, then the Company writes down the
related inventory to that value. If a write down to the current market
value is necessary, the market value cannot be greater than the net
realizable value, or ceiling (defined as selling price less costs to
sell and dispose), and cannot be lower than the net realizable value
less a normal profit margin, also called the floor. If the Company is
not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of
inventory at its current value, reserves would have to be adjusted
accordingly.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS    The
Company completed acquisitions in 2005 and 2004 valued at $289
million and $320  million, respectively. The assets and
liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase
method at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill
represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying
net assets of acquired businesses. The Company had recorded goodwill of
$741  million and $107  million of indefinite-lived trade
names at December  31,  2005.

In accordance
with SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual
impairment testing. The identification and measurement of goodwill and
unamortized intangible asset impairment involves the estimation of fair
value. The valuation of goodwill also requires the identification and
valuation of reporting units. The estimates of fair value of goodwill,
indefinite lived intangible assets and related reporting units are
based on the best information available at the date of assessment,
which primarily incorporate management assumptions about future cash
flows. Future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or
market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies
or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities. While the
Company has not recorded goodwill and intangible impairment losses in
several years, it is possible impairments may occur in the future in
the event expected profitability, cash flows or trade name usage change
significantly from current estimates.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND
EQUIPMENT    The Company generally values Property, Plant and
Equipment (‘‘PP&E’’) at historical cost
less accumulated depreciation. Impairment losses are recorded when
indicators of impairment, such as plant closures, are present and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are
less than the carrying amount. The impairment loss is quantified by
comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average
discounted cash flows, which consider various possible outcomes for the
disposition of the assets (i.e. sale, leasing, etc.). Primarily as a
result of plant rationalization, certain facilities and equipment are
not currently used in operations. The Company has recorded impairment
losses related to unused assets and additional such losses may occur in
the future.

RISK INSURANCE    To some extent, the
Company self insures for various business exposures. For domestic
workers’ compensation and product liability, the Company
generally purchases outside


insurance coverage only for severe losses
(‘‘stop loss’’ insurance). The two risk
areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are
workers’ compensation and product liability (liability for
alleged injuries associated with the Company’s products).
Actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form
the basis for workers’ compensation and product liability loss
reserves recorded. The actuary contemplates the Company’s
specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends
among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves
required. Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves
for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development
of these claims, as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims.
The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by
third party administrator specialists (insurance companies) for
workers’ compensation and by in-house legal counsel in
consultation with outside attorneys for product liability. The cash
outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over
approximately 8 to 10 years, and the present value of expected future
claim payments is reserved. The Company believes the liability recorded
for such risk insurance reserves as of December  31,  2005
is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation
process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this
estimate.

INCOME TAXES    The future tax benefit arising
from net deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards
is $97  million at December  31,  2005 and $73
million at January  1,  2005. The Company believes earnings
during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible
will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits.
For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss
carry-forwards or the projected operating results indicate that
realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. The
valuation allowance as of December  31,  2005 amounted to
$27  million.

In assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, the Company estimates future taxable income, considering the
feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of
tax loss carry-forwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax
assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax
rates and future taxable income levels. In the event the Company were
to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of
its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be
charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made.
By contrast, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to
realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying
amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a
favorable earnings adjustment in the period in which that determination
is made.

The Company periodically assesses its
liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based
on the most current available information. When it is deemed probable
that an adjustment will be asserted, the Company accrues its best
estimate of the tax liability, inclusive of related interest charges.
See Note Q Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS    The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements
include the following:

RECEIVABLE
SECURITIZATIONS    The Company has agreements to sell, on a revolving
basis, pools of accounts and notes receivables to a Qualified Special
Purpose Entity (‘‘QSPE’’), which qualifies
to be accounted for as an unconsolidated subsidiary. The entity is
designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade accounts
receivable. Assets and related debt off-balance sheet were both
$16  million at December  31,  2005, compared to
$12  million as of January  1,  2005. The Company is
responsible for servicing these accounts while the QSPE bears the risk
of non-collection. Sales of eligible receivables in 2005 amounted to
$5  million compared to none in the prior year as the
securitization was reduced by $42  million during
2004.

In 2003, the Company acquired a third party’s
interest in a Special Purpose Entity
(‘‘SPE’’) which supported the Mac tools
extended financing programs. As a result, the entity became
non-qualifying and the net assets which consisted primarily of notes
receivable of $56  million at January  3,  2004 were
consolidated in the Company’s balance sheet. No gains or losses
related to sales to the SPE were recorded. During 2003, the Company
sold $39  million of receivables in this portfolio to a third
party.


In 2004, the majority of the remaining
portfolio was sold without recourse for approximately $50
million, and the SPE was dissolved. By the end of 2004, both Mac tools
extended financing programs were largely outsourced and the majority of
the related portfolios sold, lowering but not eliminating the ongoing
credit risk. However, the Company is currently providing financing to
new distributors for their initial working capital needs and purchase
of the truck. As of December  31,  2005, such notes
receivable from distributors amounted to $8  million, net of the
related allowance for doubtful accounts.

SYNTHETIC
LEASES    The Company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for
two of its major distribution centers. The programs qualify as
operating leases for accounting purposes, such that only the monthly
rent expense is recorded in the Statement of Operations and the
liability and value of the underlying assets are off-balance sheet.
These lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and
to retain flexibility. As of December  31,  2005, the
estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these two
properties were $48  million and $40  million,
respectively.

TRUST    The Company owns 100% of
the common stock ($0.1  million) of The Stanley Works Capital
Trust I (‘‘the Trust’’) which was formed in
2005 to initiate the offering of the $450  million Enhanced Trust
Preferred Securities (‘‘ETPS Debt’’).
However, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 46R, ‘‘Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51’’
(‘‘FIN 46R’’), the Trust is not
consolidated. Since the junior subordinated debt issued by the Company
to the Trust is reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December  31,  2005, consolidation of the Trust
would have virtually no impact to the Company’s results of
operations or financial position.

ITEM
9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The
management of The Stanley Works is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of
The Stanley Works’ internal control over financial reporting as
of December  31,  2005. In making its assessment,
management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations (‘‘COSO’’) of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework.
Management concluded that based on its assessment, The Stanley
Works’ internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December  31,  2005. Management’s assessment
of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal controls of National
Manufacturing Co., a company acquired in November  2005, which is
included in


the 2005 consolidated financial statements
of The Stanley Works and constituted total assets of approximately
$230  million at December  31,  2005 and an
immaterial impact on net earnings for the year then ended. Ernst &
Young LLP, the auditor of the financial statements included in this
annual report, has issued an attestation report on management’s
assessment of internal controls, a copy of which appears on page
41.

There has been no change in The Stanley Works’
internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter
ended December  31,  2005 that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, The Stanley Works’
internal control over financial reporting.

Within the
90-day period prior to the filing of this report, under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including the
Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief
Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon
that evaluation, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and its Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company
(including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in
its periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings. There have
been no significant changes in the Company’s internal controls
or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
subsequent to the date of their evaluation.

covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

EQUITY COMPENSATION
PLAN INFORMATION

Compensation plans under which the
Company’s equity securities are authorized for issuance at
December  31,  2005
follow:

(a)

There
is a non-qualified deferred tax savings plan for highly compensated
salaried employees which mirrors the qualified plan provisions, but was
not specifically approved by security holders. U.S. employees are
eligible to contribute from 1% to 15% of their salary to
a tax deferred savings plan as described in the Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (‘‘ESOP’’) section of Item
15 Note M Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial
Statements of this Form 10-K. The Company contributes an amount equal
to one-half of the employee contribution up to the first 7% of
their salary, of which fifty-percent is invested in common stock of the
Company for qualified employees. The investment of the remaining
fifty-percent is controlled by the employee participating in the plan.
The same matching arrangement is provided for highly compensated
salaried employees in the ‘‘non-qualified’’
plan, except that the arrangement for these employees is outside of the
ESOP, and is not funded in advance of distributions. Shares of the
Company’s common stock may be issued at the time of a
distribution from the plan. The number of securities remaining
available for issuance under the plan at December  31,
2005 is not determinable, since the plan does not authorize a maximum
number of securities.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS
AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

None.

ITEM
14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES

The
information required by Item 9(e) of Schedule 14A is incorporated
herein by reference to the information set forth under the section

sheet. Other-net in the 2003 Consolidated Statement of Operations
reflects $24.5  million of financing receivable losses for these
programs, including $9.7  million pertaining to the exit from the
Mac Tools retail channel. The related allowance for doubtful accounts
of $14.8  million at January  3,  2004 for the Mac
Tools extended financing programs is comprised of $5.6  million
current and $9.2  million long-term reserves. In 2004 the
majority of the remaining Mac Tools extended financing receivables was
sold for $50
million.

(d)

Inventory reserves include
reserves for Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), First-In-First-Out (FIFO) or
valuation at current cost, as well as excess and obsolete
reserves.


MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of The
Stanley Works is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of The Stanley
Works’ internal control over financial reporting as of
December  31,  2005. In making its assessment, management
has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations (‘‘COSO’’) of the Treadway
Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework.
Management concluded that based on its assessment, The Stanley
Works’ internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December  31,  2005. Management’s assessment
of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal controls of National
Manufacturing Co., a company acquired in November  2005, which is
included in the 2005 consolidated financial statements of The Stanley
Works and constituted total assets of approximately $230  million
at December  31,  2005 and an immaterial impact on net
earnings for the year then ended. Ernst & Young LLP, the auditor of
the financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an
attestation report on management’s assessment of internal
controls, a copy of which appears on page
41.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareowners of
The Stanley Works

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of The Stanley Works and subsidiaries as of
December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
shareowners’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended December  31,  2005. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of The Stanley Works and
subsidiaries at December  31,  2005 and January
1,  2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
December  31,  2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of The Stanley
Work’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December  31,  2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated February  21,  2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and
Shareowners of The Stanley Works

We have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that The Stanley Works maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December  31,  2005, based
on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Stanley Works’
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

As indicated in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting; management’s assessment of and conclusion
on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did
not include the internal controls of National Manufacturing Co., a
company acquired in November  2005, which is included in the 2005
consolidated financial statements of The Stanley Works and constituted
total assets of approximately $230  million at December
31,  2005 and an immaterial impact on net earnings for the year
then ended.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that The Stanley Works’
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December  31,  2005 is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, The Stanley
Works’ maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December  31,  2005
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance
sheets of The Stanley Works and subsidiaries as of December
31,  2005 and January  1,  2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareowners’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended December  31,  2005 and our report dated
February  21,  2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company
and its majority-owned subsidiaries which require consolidation, after
the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to
December  31. There were 52 weeks in fiscal years 2005 and 2004,
and 53 weeks in fiscal year 2003.

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as certain financial
statement disclosures. While management believes that the estimates and
assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are
appropriate, actual results could differ from these
estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

For
foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S.
dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange
rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average
exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as gains and
losses from certain intercompany transactions, are reported in a
separate component of shareowners’ equity. Exchange gains and
losses on transactions are included in earnings, and amounted to net
(gains)/losses for 2005, 2004 and 2003 of $(0.9) million, $4.5
million and $(6.6) million, respectively.

CASH
EQUIVALENTS

Highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less are considered cash
equivalents.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Trade
receivables are stated at gross invoice amount less discounts, other
allowances and provision for uncollectible accounts. The Company
extended long-term credit to customers to fund the Mac Advantage
financing program and also provided long-term secured financing to Mac
Tools wholesale distributors. By the end of 2004, both Mac Tools
extended financing programs were largely outsourced and the majority of
the related portfolios sold, lowering but not eliminating the ongoing
credit risk. However, the Company is currently providing financing to
new Mac distributors for their initial working capital needs and
purchase of the truck. As of December  31,  2005,
such notes receivable from distributors amounted to $8  million,
net of the related allowance for doubtful accounts. The Blick business
offers extended equipment financing leases to its customers, and credit
losses on this lease portfolio are insignificant. The net activity of
the Mac Tools extended financing programs is classified in Other-net in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

ALLOWANCE
FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

The Company estimates its allowance for
doubtful accounts using two methods. First, a specific reserve is
established for individual accounts where information is available that
customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. Second,
a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of
percentages applied to aging categories. These percentages are based on
historical collection and write-off experience. Actual write offs are
charged against the allowance when internal collection efforts have
been unsuccessful, generally when payments are more than 120 days past
due.

INVENTORIES

U.S. inventories, aside from
Best, Precision, CST/Berger and certain other small businesses, are
valued at the lower of Last-In, First-Out
(‘‘LIFO’’) cost or market. Other
inventories are generally valued at the lower of First-In, First-Out
(‘‘FIFO’’) cost or market.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

The Company
generally values property, plant and equipment
(‘‘PP&E’’), including capitalized
software, on the basis of historical cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided using
straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life or the term of the lease. Costs related to
maintenance and repairs which do not prolong the assets useful lives
are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses its long-lived assets
for impairment when indicators that the carrying values may not be
recoverable are present. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment,
the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and
liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are
generated (‘‘asset group’’) and


estimates the undiscounted future cash flows
that are directly associated with and expected to be generated from the
use of and eventual disposition of such asset group. The amount of the
impairment loss, if any, is quantified by comparing the carrying amount
of the asset group to the estimated fair value, which is determined
using weighted average discounted cash flows that consider various
possible outcomes for the disposition of the asset group. Primarily as
a result of plant rationalization, certain facilities and equipment are
not currently used in operations, which has resulted in impairment
losses. PP&E impairment charges, classified in Restructuring and
Asset Impairments, amounted to zero in 2005, $3.7 million in 2004 and
$26.3 million in 2003, as described in Note O Restructuring and Asset
Impairments.

GOODWILL, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill represents costs in excess of
fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired
businesses. Intangible assets acquired are recorded at estimated fair
value. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives
are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually during the
third quarter, and at any time when events suggest impairment may have
occurred. To assess goodwill for impairment, the Company determines the
fair value of its reporting units, which are primarily determined using
management’s assumptions about future cash flows based on
long-range strategic plans. This approach incorporates many assumptions
including future growth rates, discount factors and tax rates. In the
event the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value,
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying
amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeded its implied
fair value. Indefinite lived intangible asset carrying amounts are
tested for impairment by comparing to current fair market value,
usually determined by what it would cost to lease the asset from third
parties. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their
estimated useful lives. Definite-lived intangible assets are also
evaluated for impairment when appropriate. If the carrying value
exceeds the total undiscounted future cash flows, the asset is written
down to fair value. No goodwill or other intangible assets impairments
were recorded during 2005, 2004 and 2003.

FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Derivative financial instruments are employed to
manage risks, including foreign currency and interest rate exposures,
and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The Company
recognizes all derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap
agreements, foreign currency options, and foreign exchange contracts,
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair
value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or
in shareowners’ equity as a component of other comprehensive
income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a
fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Generally, changes in fair
values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded
in earnings along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged
items that relate to the hedged risk. Gains and losses on derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are
recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified
to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.
In the event the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge
relates is no longer likely, the amount in other comprehensive income
is recognized in earnings and generally the derivative is terminated.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net
investment in foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive
income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying as
hedges, and for any portion of a hedge that is ineffective, are
reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on
interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains resulting
from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the
remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated
swap.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is
recognized when the earnings process is complete and the risks and
rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally
occurs upon shipment of the finished product but sometimes is upon
delivery to customer facilities. Provisions for customer volume
rebates, product returns, discounts and allowances are recorded as a
reduction of revenue in the same period the related sales are
recorded.


Certain Security Solutions segment
revenues include multiple elements of products and services. Revenues
from multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is
earned, consistent with the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables". Amounts allocated to each element are based
on objectively determined fair value. Additionally, revenues related to
the sale and installation of electronic access security systems are
generally recorded on the percentage-of-completion basis. This method
recognizes estimated contractual profits and revenues while projects
are in process based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to
total expected costs. Revenues from multiple element arrangements and
percentage-of-completion contracts were each less than 10% of
consolidated revenues in all years.

ADVERTISING
COSTS

Television advertising is expensed the first time the
advertisement airs, whereas other advertising is expensed as incurred.
Advertising Costs are classified as SG&A expenses and amounted to
$31.3  million in 2005, $28.3  million in 2004 and
$23.6  million in 2003. Cooperative advertising expense reported
as a deduction in net sales was $26.5  million in 2005,
$21.9  million in 2004 and $22.0  million in
2003.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is based
on reported earnings before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect
the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities
recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized
for tax purposes, and are measured by applying enacted tax rates in
effect in years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be
realized.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings
per share equals net earnings divided by weighted average shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share include the
impact of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method when
the effect is dilutive.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING
COSTS

The Company generally does not bill customers for
freight. Shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight
are reported in cost of sales. Shipping costs associated with outbound
freight are reported as a reduction of net sales and amounted to
$99.9  million, $102.3  million and $92.3  million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Distribution costs are classified in
SG&A expenses and amounted to $77.0  million, $75.8
million and $74.5  million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The
Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, ‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees’’, as amended by related interpretations of the
FASB. Accordingly, no compensation cost is recognized for stock options
unless the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date is in
excess of the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock.
Stock-based employee compensation is discussed further in Note K
Capital Stock.


If compensation cost for the
Company’s stock option plans had been determined based on the
fair value at the grant dates consistent with the method prescribed by
SFAS No. 123, ‘‘Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation’’, net earnings and earnings per share would
have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated
below:

Pro
forma compensation cost relating to the stock options is recognized
ratably over the vesting period using the accelerated method. The
expense for retiree eligible employees (those aged 55 and over and with
10 or more years of service) is recognized by the date they became
retirement eligible, as such employees may retain their options for the
10 year contractual term in the event they retire prior to the end of
the vesting period stipulated in the grant. The weighted average
vesting periods used for 2005, 2004 and 2003 stock option grants are
2.5 years, 2.5 years and 2.9 years, respectively. The fair value of
each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively:
dividend yield of 2.4%, 2.6%, and 3.6%; expected
volatility of 27%, 20% and 25%; risk-free interest
rates of 4.4% in 2005, 3.3% in 2004 and 2003; and
expected lives of 5 years in 2005, 2004 and 2003. In 2004 and earlier
years, the volatility used in computing fair value was equal to market
implied volatility, whereas in 2005 volatility is based on an average
of the market implied volatility and historical volatility for the 5
year expected life. This change in the method of determining the
volatility assumption was made in light of recent authoritative
guidance associated with SFAS 123R ‘‘Share-Based
Payment’’. The weighted average fair value of stock
options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $11.44, $6.76 and $5.17,
respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(‘‘ESPP’’) compensation cost is recognized
ratably over the one year term based on actual employee stock purchases
under the plan. The fair value of the employees’ purchase rights
under the ESPP was estimated using the following assumptions for 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively: dividend yield of 2.4%, 3.1%
and 3.9%; expected volatility of 27%, 20% and
25%; risk-free interest rates of 2.4%, 2.2% and
1.2%; and expected lives of one year. The weighted average fair
value of those purchase rights granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
$11.15, $7.03 and $6.35, respectively.

NEW ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

In December  2004, the FASB issued
Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), ‘‘Share-Based
Payment’’ (‘‘SFAS 123R’’), a
revision of FASB Statement No. 123, ‘‘Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation’’ (‘‘SFAS
123’’). SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, ‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees’’ (‘‘APB 25’’), and
amends FASB Statement No. 95, ‘‘Statement of Cash
Flows’’. The approach to quantifying stock-based
compensation expense in SFAS 123R is similar to SFAS 123. However, the
revised statement requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as an
expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their
fair values as they are earned by the employees under the vesting
terms. Pro forma disclosure of stock option expense, as is the
Company’s practice under SFAS 123, will not


be permitted after 2005. The Company plans to
follow the ‘‘modified prospective’’ method
of adoption of SFAS 123R whereby earnings for prior periods will not be
restated as though stock based compensation had been expensed, rather
than the ‘‘modified retrospective’’ method
which would entail restatement of previously published earnings. The
Company will adopt SFAS 123R as required on January  1,
2006.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company currently
accounts for share-based compensation to employees under the APB 25
intrinsic value method and generally recognizes no compensation cost
for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of the SFAS 123R
fair value method will impact the Company’s results of
operations, although it will have no impact on overall financial
position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123R will depend on levels of
share-based compensation, particularly stock options, granted in the
future and the fair value assigned thereto. The future impact of SFAS
123R is likely to approximate the pro forma compensation expense
reported under SFAS 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net
earnings and earnings per share in Note A to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company uses the actual
forfeitures method whereby pro forma compensation expense is reduced
only when options are forfeited. Under SFAS 123R, the estimated
forfeiture method is required such that expected future forfeitures
will be reflected as a reduction of stock-based compensation expense.
However, under SFAS 123R, reduction of compensation expense is not
permitted if a vested share-based payment is later forfeited, as would
occur when an out-of-the money stock option is surrendered by a
resigning employee. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as
a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow, but this
will not have a significant impact on the Company’s cash flow
reporting.

In March  2005, FASB Interpretation No.
47, ‘‘Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations (an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
143)’’ (‘‘FIN 47’’) was
issued. FIN 47 provides clarification with respect to the timing of
liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets when the timing and/or method
of settlement of the obligation are conditional on a future event. FIN
47 requires a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset
retirement obligation to be recognized if a reasonable estimate of fair
value can be made, and also clarifies when an entity would have
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of such an
obligation. The Company adopted FIN 47 for its fiscal year ended
December  31,  2005. Asset retirement obligations were
identified relating to certain activities including waste water
treatment, plating and painting processes, as well as asbestos material
in a small number of facilities. The Company is unable to estimate the
fair value of its asset retirement obligations because it does not have
sufficient information to reasonably estimate a range of settlement
dates. The assets are long-lived and there are currently no plans to
exit, significantly renovate, or demolish the assets; thus the timing
element necessary to compute fair value is unavailable. In accordance
with FIN 47, no liability has been recognized in the accompanying
balance sheet for the year ended December  31,  2005. If
and when potential settlement information becomes available for the
Company to reasonably estimate a potential settlement range and fair
value for the asset retirement obligations, a liability will be
recorded.

In February  2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 155 ‘‘Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and
140’’ (‘‘SFAS 155’’). SFAS
155 clarifies certain issues relating to embedded derivatives and
beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The provisions of
SFAS 155 are effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued
after fiscal years beginning after September  15,  2006.
The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of SFAS
155 will have on its results of operations and financial position.

In December  2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153
‘‘Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29’’ (‘‘SFAS
153’’). SFAS 153 amends the guidance in APB Opinion No.
29, ‘‘Accounting for Non-monetary
Transactions’’ by replacing the exception from fair value
measurement for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets
with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance.
SFAS 153 specifies that a non-monetary exchange has commercial
substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of SFAS 153
are effective for non-monetary asset exchanges


occurring in fiscal years beginning after
June  15,  2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 will not have
material impact on the Company’s results of operations and
financial position.

In November  2004, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 151 ‘‘Inventory Costs, an amendment of
ARB No. 43, Chapter 4’’ (‘‘SFAS
151’’). SFAS 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage.
In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production
overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of
the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for
inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
June  15,  2005. The adoption of SFAS 151 will not have a
material impact on the Company’s results of operations and
financial position.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain
prior years’ amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. All prior periods reflect a balance sheet
reclassification between the components of shareowners’ equity
related to unearned ESOP shares and the associated deferred tax asset,
such that all years presented in the financial statements are
comparable. The effect of this reclassification, which pertains
to 2000 and earlier years, is a $15.4  million decrease in
long-term deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase to
total shareowners’ equity. In addition, the assets and
liabilities of discontinued operations have been reclassified as held
for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the earnings from
discontinued operations have been reclassified within the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

B. ACCOUNTS AND NOTES
RECEIVABLE

Trade
receivables are dispersed among a large number of retailers,
distributors and industrial accounts in many countries. Adequate
reserves have been established to cover anticipated credit losses.

The Company has agreements to sell, on a revolving basis,
undivided interests in defined pools of notes receivable to a Qualified
Special Purpose Entity (‘‘QSPE’’). The
entity is designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade
accounts receivable and is used as an additional source of liquidity.
At December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005,
the defined pools of receivables amounted to $158.3  million and
$157.5  million, respectively, while the agreement permits the
QSPE to have a maximum of $150  million of borrowings outstanding
at any time. The proceeds from sales of such eligible receivables to
the QSPE in revolving-period securitizations were $4.7  million
in 2005, and in 2004 the securitization was reduced by $42.3
million. There were no gains or losses on these sales. The amounts
deducted from receivables in the December  31,  2005 and
January  1,  2005 Consolidated Balance Sheets under this
arrangement were $16.4  million and $11.7  million,
respectively. The Company is responsible for servicing and collecting
the receivables sold and held in the QSPE. Any incremental costs
related to such servicing and collection efforts are not significant.
The QSPE bears the risk of non-collection on the receivables it has
purchased.

C.
INVENTORY

Net
inventories in the amount of $200.3  million at December
31,  2005 and $177.5  million at January  1,
2005 were valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. If the LIFO
method had not been


used, inventories would have been
$65.5  million higher than reported at December  31,
2005 and $58.4  million higher than reported at January
1,  2005. The LIFO method is utilized in determining inventory
value as it results in better matching of cost and revenues.

D.
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

At December  31,
2005,  real property in the Consumer Products segment, valued at
$0.6  million was classified as held for sale. The Company has
also committed to a plan to divest of the assets associated with the
Goldblatt

®

product line in this same segment, and accordingly those
assets, amounting to $1.7  million, are classified as held for
sale at December  31,  2005. At January  1,
2005, the Company had three properties, valued at $1.4  million,
classified as held for sale related to plant rationalization
activities; such assets amounted to $0.6  million, $0.7
million and $0.1  million within the Consumer Products,
Industrial Tools and Security Solutions segments,
respectively.

Additionally, the net assets of the
appliance hinge and U.K. decorator tools businesses, which are expected
to be sold in fiscal 2006, are classified as held for sale at
December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005, as
detailed in Note T Discontinued Operations. Assets held for sale are
reported at the lower of fair value less cost to sell or carrying
value.

At January  1,  2005, $42.9
million in financing lease receivables were classified as held for
sale. These receivables, generated by the Blick business within the
Security Solutions segment, were sold on January  5,  2005,
and an insignificant gain was recognized thereon in fiscal
2005.

E. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Depreciation
and amortization expense associated with property, plant and equipment
was as
follows:

The
amounts above are inclusive of discontinued operations depreciation and
amortization expense of $0.3  million in 2005, $3.0
million in 2004 and $5.2  million in 2003.

F.
ACQUISITIONS

The Company completed 16 acquisitions during
2005, 2004 and 2003. These businesses were acquired pursuant to the
Company's growth strategy. The acquisitions were accounted for by
the purchase method in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141 (‘‘SFAS
141’’), ‘‘Business
Combinations’’ and their results are included in the
Company's consolidated operating results from the respective
acquisition dates. All of the acquisitions have resulted in the
recognition of goodwill. Goodwill reflects the future earnings and cash
flow potential of the acquired business in excess of the fair values
that are assigned to all other identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill arises


because the purchase price paid reflects
numerous factors including the strategic fit and expected synergies
these targets bring to existing operations, the competitive nature of
the bidding process and the prevailing market value for comparable
companies. SFAS 141 requires all identifiable assets and liabilities
acquired to be reported at fair value and the excess is recorded as
goodwill. The Company obtains information during due diligence and from
other sources which forms the basis for the initial allocation of
purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities
acquired. In the months following an acquisition, independent
intangible asset valuation reports, asset appraisals and other data is
obtained in order to finalize the fair values assigned to acquired
assets and liabilities.

Integration of certain
acquisitions requires reduction of redundant personnel, closure of
facilities, and other restructuring actions related to the acquired
businesses. In such cases, a restructuring accrual is recorded for
actions identified in integration strategy plans initially developed by
the Company as of the acquisition date, with a resulting increase to
goodwill. As integration strategies are executed, the Company monitors
the previously established restructuring accruals and makes adjustments
to the extent actual expenditures differ from the estimated accruals.
Adjustments recorded to previously established restructuring accruals
until the time integration plans are fully executed, not to exceed one
year from date of original acquisition, are reflected in the final
goodwill amount included in the purchase price allocation. Adjustments
made subsequent to the finalization of integration strategies, or after
one year from the date of original acquisition, are reflected in
earnings if increases to the originally established accruals are
required, while accruals that are not fully utilized are appropriately
reduced against goodwill.

ACQUISITIONS

During the first quarter of 2005, the Company
completed the acquisition of Security Group, Inc.
(‘‘Security Group’’) on January
4,  2005 and acquired certain assets and liabilities of Rolatape
Corporation (‘‘Rolatape’’) as of
March  11,  2005 for a combined cost of $57.4
million. The Security Group acquisition entails contingent purchase
price of up to $3  million additional cash to be paid in the
future based on the achievement of certain sales milestones, and this
amount has been fully accrued in the purchase price allocation as a
liability as of December  31,  2005. Security Group
manufactures and distributes locking devices, lock parts and safes in
the United States and Europe. Rolatape, a small-bolt on to the 2004 CST

builders’ hardware that markets the majority of its product
range through the two-step cooperative channel to the builder trade and
serves over 25,000 outlets with manufacturing operations in the U.S.,
Canada and Mexico.

The total purchase price of
$288.5  million for the 2005 acquisitions reflects transaction
costs and is net of cash acquired. Amounts allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed are based on estimates of fair value.
Adjustments to reflect the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are complete for Security Group, EVS, Rolatape, and
Sielox. However, the purchase price


allocations for the ABZ, Pinnacle, Precision
and National acquisitions are preliminary, mainly with respect to
finalization of intangible asset valuations, related deferred taxes,
fixed asset appraisals and execution of acquisition date integration
plans.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair
values of major assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the 2005
acquisitions in the
aggregate:

The
purchase price allocation above includes a $6.9  million hold
back note payable that was issued in conjunction with the Security
Group acquisition which was repaid in quarterly installments during
2005.

The weighted average useful lives assigned to the
amortizable assets identified above are trade names — 8 years;
customer relationships — 9 years; patents and technology

The Company effectively
acquired Blick plc (‘‘Blick’’) on
January  20,  2004 by which date 86% of the
outstanding share capital was purchased, and all remaining shares were
acquired shortly thereafter. The final purchase price for Blick was
$177  million, including $22  million of debt. Blick is a
leading U.K. integrator of security systems, communication and time
management solutions for the commercial and industrial sectors. On
March  9,  2004, the Company acquired Frisco Bay Industries

and installer was acquired; the purchase price for these fourth quarter
acquisitions was $40  million.

The total purchase
price of $320  million for the 2004 acquisitions reflects
transaction costs and is net of cash acquired. Amounts allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on estimates of fair
value. Adjustments to reflect the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are complete for the 2004 acquisitions.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of
major assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the 2004 acquisitions
in the
aggregate:

The
weighted average useful lives assigned to the amortizable assets
identified above are trade names — 4 years; customer
relationships — 11 years; patents and copyrights — 5
years; and other intangible assets — 4 years. The amount
allocated to trade names includes $9.1  million associated with

I. LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCING
ARRANGEMENTS

Long-term debt and financing arrangements at
December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005
follow:

In
December  2005, the Company amended its 5 year revolving credit
agreement, increasing the size from $400  million to $550
million, and including provisions that allow designated subsidiaries to
borrow up to $250  million in Euros and Pounds Sterling. The
credit agreement maturity is unchanged at October  2009. The
Company pays a commitment fee of 0.08% per annum (approximately
$0.4  million).

In addition, the Company has
short-term lines of credit with numerous banks aggregating
$184.0  million, of which $155.3  million was available at
December  31,  2005. Short-term arrangements are reviewed
annually for renewal. Of the aggregate $734.0  million long-term
and short-term lines, $400.0  million is available to support the
Company’s commercial paper program. The weighted average
interest rates on short-term borrowings at December  31,
2005 and January  1,  2005 were 4.2% and
1.4%, respectively.

In November  2005, the
Company issued $450  million of junior subordinated debt
securities to The Stanley Works Capital Trust I
(‘‘Trust’’), with a 40-year term and a
fixed initial coupon rate of 5.902% for the first five years.
The Trust, which is not consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R,
obtained the funds it loaned to the Company through the capital market
sale of $450  million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities
(‘‘ETPS’’). The obligations, tenor and
terms of the ETPS mirror those of the junior subordinated debt
securities. The securities may be redeemed after five years without
penalty. If not redeemed after 5 years, the coupon rate will reset
quarterly to 1.4% plus the highest of 3-month LIBOR, the 10-Year
US Treasury CMT or the 30-Year US Treasury CMT, limited to a maximum
rate of 13.25%. Net proceeds of the issuance were used to
partially finance the acquisitions of Facom (January 1, 2006) and
National (November 30, 2005).

To manage interest costs
and foreign exchange risk, the Company maintains a portfolio of swap
agreements. See Note J Financial Instruments for more information
regarding the Company's interest rate and currency swap
agreements.

Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt
for each of the years from 2006 to 2010 are $22.1  million,
$227.9  million, $4.2  million, $4.0  million and
$6.4  million, respectively. Interest paid during 2005, 2004, and
2003 amounted to $38.9  million, $39.0  million, and
$32.9  million, respectively.

Included in Short-term
borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December
31,  2005 and January  1,  2005, is commercial paper
utilized to support working capital requirements of $105.7
million and $12.1  million, respectively.

In
March  2004, the Company repaid $120  million of long-term
debt which matured on March  1,  2004 with commercial paper
borrowings. The Company assumed $29  million of debt in the Blick
and Frisco


Bay acquisitions. As of December
31,  2005 and January  1,  2005, the remaining
balance of the Blick purchase obligation was $20.4  million and
$22.8  million, respectively, which is reflected in the current
portion of long-term debt.

In 2005, the Company paid
$70.6  million to purchase 2.5  million shares of common
stock, settling the remaining portion of the common stock equity hedge
forward contracts that were entered into in June  2003. The
notional principal balance of $70.6  million as of January
1,  2005 had been recognized as debt on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and the 2.5  million underlying shares were excluded from
the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per
share. Refer to Note K, Capital Stock, for further details on the
extinguished equity hedge contracts.

J. FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s objectives in using debt
related financial instruments are to obtain the lowest cost source of
funds within a targeted range of variable to fixed-rate debt
proportions and to minimize the foreign exchange risk of obligations.
To meet these risk management objectives, the Company enters into
interest rate swap and currency swap agreements. Derivative instruments
are not employed for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recognized
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and hedge accounting
is applied based on the criteria specified in SFAS No. 133,
‘‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities’’, whereby management designates its
derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net
investment hedges.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Purchased
currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to
reduce exchange risks arising from cross-border cash flows expected to
occur over the next one year period. The Company also enters into
forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge
intercompany activity. The objective of these practices is to minimize
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating results. In
addition, interest rate swaps are utilized to either create a floating
rate or a fixed rate liability, as the Company looks to achieve the
optimal mix of fixed versus floating rate debt.

At
December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005,
forward contracts hedging intercompany transactions totaled
$84.3  million and $78.6  million, respectively. The
existing foreign exchange forward contracts are denominated in
Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Danish Krone, Euro, Japanese Yen,
Great Britain Pound, New Zealand Dollars, South African Rand, Swiss
Franc, Swedish Krona, Taiwanese Dollars and Thai Baht. The contracts
mature within approximately 90 days. The aggregate fair value of these
forward contracts is a $0.1  million gain that is recorded in
Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

Interest rate swaps:

The Company has
executed interest rate swaps to exchange the floating rate rent
associated with two of its major distribution centers to a fixed rent
amount. In addition, the Company entered into a thirty year floating to
fixed interest rate swap with a notional value of $150  million.
The swap hedges the interest rate exposure associated with the
underlying borrowing of $150  million of 3.5% bonds
maturing November  1,  2007, which the Company intends to
refinance upon maturity. At December  31,  2005, the
aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps is a net gain of
$1.1  million as reflected in Other Assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

In November  2005, the Company
entered into interest rate swaps prior to the issuance of its Enhanced
Trust Preferred Security (‘‘ETPS’’) with an
aggregate notional value of $300  million. These swaps were used
to mitigate interest rate volatility relative to the 5 year Treasury
rate by effectively fixing the ETPS 5 year rate. The interest rate
swaps had original maturity dates of November  2010, which
matched the end of the fixed rate ETPS term. As planned, the swaps were
terminated at the time of the ETPS issuance resulting in a loss of
$1.3  million, which is reflected in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheet; this loss will be
amortized to interest expense over a period of five
years.

Cross currency swaps:

The Company and
its subsidiaries have entered into various intercompany transactions
whereby the notional values were denominated in currencies (United
States Dollar, Euro and Canadian Dollar) other than the functional
currencies of the party executing the trade (United


States Dollar and Euro). In order to better
match the cash flows of its intercompany obligations with cash flows
from operations, the Company entered into cross currency swaps. The
swaps have an aggregate United States Dollar notional value of
$319.3  million and maturity dates ranging from April  2006
to November  2010. At December  31,  2005, the
aggregate fair value of the Company’s cross currency swaps that
were designated as cash flow hedges, was a net loss of $17.4
million as reflected in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

For derivative instruments that are so designated
at inception and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the
effective portions of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in
accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of
shareowners’ equity, and subsequently reclassifies these amounts
into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is
recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss, if
any, is immediately recognized in Other-net in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The gains and losses recorded on these
transactions are not material to the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements. The $6.4  million reported for cash flow
hedge effectiveness in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of
December  31,  2005 will be reclassified to earnings when
the hedged transactions occur in the years 2006 through 2037. The
ultimate amount recognized will vary based on fluctuations of the
hedged currencies (Euro, Great Britain Pound and Canadian Dollar)
through the maturity dates.

FAIR VALUE
HEDGES

For derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes the gain or loss
on the derivative instrument in earnings in Other-net with the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item also being recognized in
earnings in the current period.

Cross currency
swaps:

The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into
various intercompany transactions wherein the notional values were
denominated in currencies (United States Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen and
Great Britain Pound) other than the functional currencies of the party
executing the trade (United States Dollar and Euro). In order to better
match the cash flows of its intercompany obligations with cash flows
from operations, the Company entered into various cross currency swaps.
The swaps have an aggregate United States Dollar notional value of
$328.0  million with maturity dates ranging from December
2006 to September  2010. At December  31,  2005 the
aggregate fair value of the Company’s cross currency swaps that
were designated as fair value hedges, was a net gain of $8.0
million as reflected in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGE

The Company
utilizes net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment
arising from remeasuring its investment in the assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses of its foreign subsidiaries. For derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges,
the Company records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument in other comprehensive income, a separate
component of shareowners’ equity.

In
February  2004, the Company entered into a cross currency swap
with a United States Dollar notional value of $45.4  million to
hedge its net investment in Great Britain Pound assets. The Company
pays Great Britain Pounds and receives United States Dollars using
fixed interest rates, offsetting the translation adjustment of its net
investment in Great Britain Pound assets. This swap has a maturity date
of February  2014. At December  31,  2005, the fair
value of this currency swap was a loss of $0.8  million and is
recorded in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the
loss on the net investment hedge included in other comprehensive income
was $0.7  million.

HEDGE
EFFECTIVENESS

For forward contracts and cross currency swaps
designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, the Company measures
hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the hedge
contract with the cumulative change in the hedged item, both of which
are based on forward rates. The ineffective portion, if any, of the
hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. Hedge ineffectiveness was
immaterial for 2005, 2004, and 2003.

For interest rate
swaps designated as cash flow hedges, the Company measures the hedging
effectiveness by offsetting the change in the variable portion of the
interest rate swap with the change in the expected interest flows due
to fluctuations in the LIBOR based interest rate.


The counterparties to all of the
above mentioned financial instruments are major international financial
institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk for net exchanges
under these agreements, but not for the notional amounts. The risk of
default is considered remote.

The carrying values and
fair values of the Company’s financial instruments at
December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005
follow:

Generally,
the carrying value of the debt related financial instruments is
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in long-term debt. The fair
values of long-term debt instruments are estimated using discounted
cash flow analysis, based on the Company’s marginal borrowing
rates. The fair values of foreign currency and interest rate swap
agreements are based on current settlement values. The carrying amount
of cash equivalents and short-term borrowings approximates fair
value.

Weighted-average shares outstanding used to
calculate basic and diluted earnings per share for each year were as
follows:

COMMON
STOCK SHARE ACTIVITY

Common stock share activity for 2005,
2004 and 2003 was as
follows:

COMMON
STOCK EQUITY HEDGE

The Company previously entered into equity
hedges, in the form of equity forwards on its common shares, to offset
the dilutive effect of in-the-money stock options on earnings per share
and to reduce potential cash outflow for the repurchase of the
Company’s stock to offset stock option exercises. Under the
former equity hedge contracts, when the price of the Company’s
common stock appreciated since the last quarterly interim settlement,
the Company received its common shares from the counterparties. When
the price of the Company stock depreciated since the last quarterly
interim settlement, the Company delivered its common stock from
treasury shares to the counterparties. Interim quarterly settlements
were in shares of common stock, not cash, and were accounted for within
equity. In April  2003, the Company settled $100  million
of the contracts through a cash repurchase of 3.9  million
underlying shares at that time. In June  2003, the remaining
$113  million in the Company’s common stock equity hedge
forward contracts were modified to full physical settlement contracts
with a fixed notional principal of $113  million and 4.1
million of underlying shares. As discussed in Note I Long-term Debt and
Financing Arrangements, all remaining outstanding principal was repaid
during 2005.

Exclusive of final settlement activity in
2003, the annual settlement activity under the equity hedge was
1,896,482 shares of common stock with a market value of $47.2
million ($66.0  million book value) delivered in 2003. This
annual settlement activity is reflected as issued from treasury in the
table of common stock share activity.

the public announcement that a person has acquired beneficial ownership
of 10% or more of the


outstanding shares of common stock. In the
event that the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
combination transaction, provision shall be made so that each holder of
a right (other than a holder who is a 10%-or-more shareowner)
shall have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof, that number of
shares of common stock of the surviving Company having a market value
equal to two times the exercise price of the right. Similarly, if
anyone becomes the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the then
outstanding shares of common stock (except pursuant to an offer for all
outstanding shares of common stock which the independent directors have
deemed to be fair and in the best interest of the Company), provision
will be made so that each holder of a right (other than a holder who is
a 10%-or-more shareowner) shall thereafter have the right to
receive, upon exercise thereof, common stock (or, in certain
circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company)
having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the
right. At December  31,  2005 there were 41,895,565
outstanding rights. There are 250,000 shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock reserved for issuance in connection with
the rights. Refer to Note U Subsequent Events for information
pertaining to an amendment of the preferred stock purchase
rights.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The
Company has stock-based compensation plans for salaried employees and
non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The plans provide for
discretionary grants of stock options, restricted stock units, and
other stock-based awards. The plans are generally administered by the
Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors,
consisting of non-employee directors.

Stock
Options:

Stock options are granted at the market price of the
Company’s stock on the date of grant and have a ten-year term.
Generally, stock option grants vest ratably between one and four years
from the date of grant. The number of stock options and
weighted-average exercise prices
follows:

At
December  31,  2005, the range of exercise prices on
outstanding stock options was $19.34 to $51.84. Outstanding and
exercisable stock option information at December  31,  2005
follows:

Restricted
Share Units:

Compensation cost for restricted share units
(RSU’s) granted to employees is recognized ratably over the
vesting term, which varies but is generally 1 to 4 years. Non-employee
members of the Board of Directors may also elect to receive payment for
their service on the Board


in the form of RSU’s which are
expensed immediately. RSU grants totaled 122,891 shares, 107,293
shares, and 106,158 shares in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
weighted-average grant date fair value of RSU’s granted in 2005,
2004 and 2003 was $47.28, $40.17, and $25.16 per share, respectively.
Additionally, in 2005 and 2004, non-employee members of the Board of
Directors received restricted share-based grants which must be cash
settled to which mark-to-market accounting is applied; the expense
recognized for these grants was $0.6  million in 2005, and
$0.4  million in 2004.

Long-term Stock Incentive
Plan:

The Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan
(‘‘LTSIP’’) provides for grants of awards
to senior management employees for achieving Company performance
measures, including earnings per share and return on capital employed.
Awards are payable in shares of common stock, which may be restricted
if the employee has not achieved certain stock ownership levels, and no
award is made if the employee terminates employment prior to the payout
date. There are two award cycles currently in progress: one for the two
and one half year period ending in December, 2006 and the second for
the three year period ending in December, 2007. The ultimate issuance
of shares, if any, is determined based solely on performance in the
final year of each cycle. The Company has accrued for the expected
issuance of shares based on estimates of future performance in relation
to the targets. Expense recognized for the LTSIP plans amounted to
$6.4  million in 2005, $1.6  million in 2004 and zero in
2003.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

The
Employee Stock Purchase Plan enables substantially all employees in the
United States, Canada and Belgium to subscribe at any time to purchase
shares of common stock on a monthly basis at the lower of 85% of
the fair market value of the shares on the grant date ($35.21 per share
for fiscal year 2005 purchases) or 85% of the fair market value
of the shares on the last business day of each month. A maximum of
6,000,000 shares are authorized for subscription. During 2005, 2004 and
2003 shares totaling 96,683, 118,544 and 49,743, respectively, were
issued under the plan at average prices of $33.19, $26.78 and $23.41
per share, respectively.

L. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE
LOSS

Accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of
each fiscal year was as
follows:

M.
EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT  PLANS

EMPLOYEE
STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
(‘‘ESOP’’)

Substantially all U.S.
employees may contribute from 1% to 15% of their eligible
compensation to a tax-deferred 401(k) savings plan, subject to
restrictions under tax laws. Employees generally direct the investment
of their own contributions into various investment funds. An employer
match benefit is provided under the plan equal to one-half of each
employee’s tax-deferred contribution up to the first 7%
of their compensation. Half of the employer match benefit is invested
in the Company’s common stock while the investment of the other
half is directed by the employee. The employer match benefit totaled
$8.3  million, $7.3  million and $5.3  million, in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In addition,
approximately 4,300 U.S. salaried and non-union hourly employees
receive a non-contributory benefit under the Cornerstone plan.
Cornerstone benefit allocations range from 3% to 9% of
eligible employee compensation based on age. Approximately 1,600 U.S.
employees receive an additional average 1.7% contribution
actuarially designed to replace previously curtailed pension benefits.
Allocations for benefits earned under the Cornerstone plan were
$12.3  million in 2005, $12.6  million in 2004, and
$13.9  million in 2003. Assets held in participant Cornerstone
accounts are invested in a broad-based U.S. equity security index fund
and U.S. government bonds.


Shares of the Company’s
common stock held by the ESOP were purchased with the proceeds of
external borrowings in 1989 and borrowings from the Company in 1991
("1991 internal loan"). The external ESOP
borrowings are guaranteed by the Company and are included in long-term
debt. Shareowners’ equity reflects a reduction equal to the cost
basis of unearned (unallocated) shares purchased with the internal and
the external borrowings.

The Company accounts for the ESOP
under Statement of Position (‘‘SOP’’) 76-3,
‘‘Accounting Practices for Certain Employee Stock
Ownership Plans’’, as affected by the Emerging Issues
Task Force (‘‘EITF’’) 89-8,
‘‘Expense Recognition for Employee Stock Ownership
Plans.’’ Net ESOP activity recognized is comprised of the
cost basis of shares released, the cost of the aforementioned
Cornerstone and 401(k) match defined contribution benefits, interest
expense on the external 1989 borrowing, less the fair value of shares
released and dividends on unallocated ESOP shares. Net ESOP expense was
$2.1  million in 2005, $2.2  million in 2004 and
$9.2  million in 2003. ESOP expense is affected by the market
value of the Company’s common stock on the monthly dates when
shares are released. The market value of shares released averaged
$46.41 per share in 2005, $43.20 in 2004, and $29.25 in 2003.

Unallocated shares are released from the trust based on
current period debt principal and interest payments as a percentage of
total future debt principal and interest payments. Dividends on both
allocated and unallocated shares may be used for debt service and to
credit participant accounts for dividends earned on allocated shares.
Dividends paid on the shares acquired with the 1991 internal loan were
used solely to pay internal loan debt service in all periods. Dividends
on ESOP shares, which are charged to shareowners’ equity as
declared, were $12.1  million in 2005, $12.2  million in
2004 and $12.4  million in 2003. Dividends on ESOP shares were
utilized entirely for debt service in all years. Interest costs
incurred by the ESOP on the 1989 external debt in 2005, 2004 and 2003
were $0.4  million, $0.7  million and $0.9  million,
respectively. Interest costs incurred by the ESOP on the 1991 internal
loan, which have no earnings impact, were $9.5  million,
$9.7  million, and $9.9  million for 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. Both allocated and unallocated ESOP shares are treated as
outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share. As of
December  31,  2005, the number of ESOP shares allocated to
participant accounts was 4,485,721 and the number of unallocated shares
was 5,858,275. At December  31,  2005, there were 34,673
released shares in the ESOP trust holding account pending allocation.
The Company made cash contributions to the ESOP totaling $13.3
million in 2005, $10.2  million in 2004, and $10.5  million
in 2003.

PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS

The
Company sponsors pension plans covering most domestic hourly and
certain executive employees, and approximately 2,000 foreign employees.
Benefits are generally based on salary and years of service, except for
U.S. collective bargaining employees whose benefits are based on a
stated amount for each year of service.

The Company
contributes to multi-employer plans for certain collective bargaining
U.S. employees. In addition, various other defined contribution plans
are sponsored worldwide. The expense for such defined contribution
plans, aside from the earlier discussed ESOP plan,
follows.


The components of net periodic
pension expense (income) are as
follows:

The
Company provides medical and dental benefits for certain retired
employees in the United States. In addition, U.S. employees who retire
from active service are eligible for life insurance benefits. Net
periodic postretirement benefit expense was $2.0  million in
2005, $1.8  million in 2004 and $2.0  million in
2003.


The Company generally uses a
November  30 measurement date for its pension plans with plan
assets and a December  31 measurement date for other plans. The
changes in the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations,
fair value of plan assets as well as amounts recognized in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, are shown
below:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans
was $372.9  million at December  31,  2005 and
$275.9  million at January  1,
2005.


Information regarding pension plans
in which accumulated benefit obligations exceed plan assets
follows:

Information
regarding pension plans in which projected benefit obligations
(inclusive of anticipated future compensation increases) exceed plan
assets
follows:

The
major assumptions used in valuing pension and post-retirement plan
obligations and net costs were as
follows:

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined
considering the returns projected for the various asset classes and the
relative weighting for each asset class as reflected in the target
asset allocation below. In addition the Company considers historical
performance, the opinions of outside actuaries and other data in
developing benchmark returns.

PENSION PLAN
ASSETS

Plan assets are invested in equity securities, bonds
and other fixed income securities, real estate, money market
instruments and insurance contracts. The Company’s
weighted-average worldwide actual asset allocations at December
31,  2005 and January  1,  2005 by asset category are
as
follows:

The
Company’s investment strategy for pension plan assets includes
diversification to minimize interest and market risks, and generally
does not involve the use of derivative financial instruments. Plan
assets are rebalanced periodically to maintain target asset
allocations. Maturities of investments


are not necessarily related to the timing of
expected future benefit payments, but adequate liquidity to make
immediate and medium term benefit payments is
ensured.

CONTRIBUTIONS

The Company’s
funding policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts
determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and
future benefits in accordance with federal law and other regulations.
The Company expects to contribute approximately $15  million to
its pension plans and its other postretirement benefit plan in
2006.

EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS

Benefit
payments, inclusive of amounts attributable to estimated future
employee service, are expected to be paid as follows over the next 10
years:

Company.

HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS

The weighted
average annual assumed rate of increase in the per-capita cost of
covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) is assumed to be
9.0% for 2005, reducing gradually to 6.0% by 2012 and
remaining at that level thereafter. A one percentage point change in
the assumed health care cost trend rate would have an immaterial effect
on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and the postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31,  2005.

N. OTHER
COSTS AND EXPENSES

Other-net is primarily comprised of
intangible asset amortization expense, gains and losses on asset
dispositions, currency impact, environmental expense and net expenses
related to the Mac tools extended financing programs, mainly financing
receivable losses and interest income. Other-net in 2003 includes
$9.5  million in charges related to the exit of the Mac tools
retail channel.

Research and development costs were
$14.5  million, $13.2  million and $8.7  million for
fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


O. RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET
IMPAIRMENTS

At December  31,  2005, the
restructuring and asset impairment reserve balance was $4.9
million, which the Company expects to be fully expended by the end of
2006. A summary of the Company’s restructuring reserves for the
years ended January  1,  2005 to December  31,
2005 is as
follows:

For
the three years ended December 31, 2005, 27 facilities have been closed
as a result of restructuring initiatives. In 2005, 2004 and 2003,
approximately 219, 160, and 1,100 employees have been terminated as a
result of restructuring initiatives, respectively. Severance payments
of $6  million, $4  million and $18  million and
other exit costs of $1  million, $4  million, and
$10  million were made in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Write-offs of impaired assets were $2  million, $11
million and $18  million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

2005 Actions:

During the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company initiated a $0.6  million cost
reduction program at its Specialty Tool, Assembly, Blick and European
operations. The action was comprised of the severance of approximately
47 employees. Of this amount, $0.1  million has been utilized to
date with $0.5  million of accrual remaining as of
December  31,  2005. Approximately $0.2  million of
such charge was related to the Security Solutions segment; $0.2
million to the Industrial Tools segment; and $0.2  million to the
Consumer Products segment. During the third quarter of 2005, the
Company initiated a $1.8  million cost reduction program
primarily at its mechanical access and fastening systems businesses,
along with its European operations. The action was comprised of the
severance of approximately 54 employees. Of this amount, $1.4
million has been utilized to date with $0.4  million of accrual
remaining as of December  31,  2005. $0.7  million of
this charge was recorded in the Security Solutions segment; $0.8
million in the Industrial Tools segment; and $0.3  million in the
Consumer Products segment.

During the second quarter of
2005, the Company initiated a second phase of cost reduction activities
at its Blick business, included in the Company’s Security
Solutions segment, for which approximately $2.2  million was
recorded to restructuring expense in 2005. This action was taken to
streamline Blick’s business model and primarily entailed the
severance of 64 employees. Of this amount, $1.8  million has been
utilized to date with $0.4  million of accrual remaining as of
December  31,  2005.

Actions:

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded
$8  million of restructuring and asset impairment charges
— $4  million of restructuring costs in connection with
specific personnel actions to streamline/reposition certain
organizations primarily in the Consumer Products and


Industrial Tools segments; and $4
million of asset impairment charges primarily associated with a 2004
information system strategy decision. As of December  31,
2005, the accrual was fully expended.

2003 Actions:

In 2003, the Company recorded $49  million in restructuring and
asset impairment charges for the Operation 15 initiative. These charges
consisted of $12  million for severance, $26  million of
asset impairments and $11  million of other exit costs related to
the exit from the Company’s MacDirect retail channel. The asset
impairments generally pertain to assets which are idle mainly as a
result of restructuring initiatives and accordingly their book value
has been written down to fair value. As of December  31,
2005, $1.3  million of severance reserves remain.

The Company also recorded $3  million in restructuring
charges for initiatives pertaining to the further reduction of its cost
structure, primarily for severance-related obligations. As of
December  31,  2005, no accrual remained as all of the
severance had been expended.

Acquisition
Related:

Integration of certain acquisitions requires
reduction of redundant personnel, closure of facilities, and other
restructuring actions related to the acquired businesses. In such
cases, a restructuring accrual is recorded for actions identified in
integration strategy plans initially developed by the Company as of the
acquisition date, with a resulting increase to goodwill. As integration
strategies are executed, the Company monitors the previously
established restructuring accruals and makes adjustments to the extent
actual expenditures differ from the estimated accruals. Adjustments
recorded to previously established restructuring accruals until the
time integration plans are fully executed, not to exceed one year from
date of original acquisition, are reflected in the final goodwill
amount included in the purchase price allocation. Adjustments made
subsequent to the finalization of integration strategies, or after one
year from the date of original acquisition, are reflected in the
earnings if increases to the reserve are required, while decreases in
such reserves are appropriately applied against
goodwill.

In connection with its acquisition of National
Hardware, the Company recorded $1.0  million relating to
severance costs to the initial purchase price allocation, of which no
amounts have been utilized as of December  31,  2005. In
connection with its acquisition of Precision, the Company recorded
$1.5  million relating to severance costs to the initial purchase
price allocation, of which $0.7  million has been utilized to
date with $0.8  million of accrual remaining as of
December  31,  2005. In connection with its acquisitions of
ISR and Security Group, the Company recorded $1.4  million of
restructuring reserves in the purchase price allocation comprised of
$1.1  million of severance and $0.3  million of lease exit
costs. Of this amount, $0.9  million has been utilized to date
with $0.5  million of accrual remaining as of December
31,  2005.

In connection with the first quarter
2004 acquisitions, $5  million in restructuring reserves were
recorded, primarily for severance, which have been fully utilized as of
December  31,  2005.

Restructuring and asset
impairment charges by segment were as
follows:

P.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

The Company
reports the following three segments:    Consumer Products,
Industrial Tools and Security Solutions. The Consumer Products segment
includes hand tools, consumer mechanics tools, storage units, and
hardware. Industrial Tools is comprised of fastening systems, Mac
tools, Proto mechanic tools, pneumatic tools, storage systems,
specialty tools, assembly technologies, hydraulic tools and CST/Berger
(measuring tools). The Security Solutions segment includes access
technologies, Best Access, Blick, Frisco Bay, ISR, Security Group,
Precision Hardware and Senior Technologies; these businesses
manufacture and install automatic doors, and related hardware and

as mechanical and electronic lock sets and
access controls. The Company’s reportable segments are an
aggregation of businesses that have similar products and services,
among other factors. The following information excludes the appliance
hinge, U.K. decorator tools, residential entry door, home décor
and German paint roller businesses, which are classified as
discontinued operations as disclosed in Note T Discontinued Operations,
unless otherwise noted.

BUSINESS
SEGMENTS


The Company assesses the
performance of its reportable business segments using operating profit,
which follows the same accounting policies as those described in Note A
Significant Accounting Policies. Segment operating profit excludes
interest income, interest expense, other-net (which includes intangible
asset amortization), restructuring charges and asset impairments, and
income tax expense. Refer to Note O Restructuring and Asset Impairments
for the amount of restructuring charges and asset impairments by
segment, and to Note G Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other
Intangible Assets for intangible amortization expense by segment.
Corporate and shared expenses are allocated to each segment.
Transactions between segments are not material. Segment assets
primarily include accounts receivable, inventory, other current assets,
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other
miscellaneous assets. Corporate assets and unallocated assets are cash,
deferred income taxes and certain other assets. Geographic net sales
and long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic regions based on
the geographic location of each Company subsidiary.

Sales
to The Home Depot were approximately 12%, 13% and
14% of consolidated net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, excluding the discontinued operations businesses
discussed in Note T Discontinued Operations. For 2005, 2004 and 2003
net sales to this one customer amounted to 26%, 27% and
27% of segment net sales, respectively, for the Consumer
Products segment, 6%, 7%, and 7%, respectively,
for the Industrial Tools segment and 2%, 3% and
4%, respectively, for the Security Solutions segment. Inclusive
of the appliance hinge, U.K. decorator tools, residential entry door,

Q. INCOME
TAXES

Significant components of the Company’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each fiscal year were
as
follows:

Valuation
allowances reduced the deferred tax asset attributable to foreign and
state loss carry-forwards to the amount that, based upon all available
evidence, is more likely than not to be realized. Reversal of the
valuation allowance is contingent upon the recognition of future
taxable income and capital gains in specific foreign countries and
specific states, or changes in circumstances which cause the
recognition of the benefits to become more likely than not. The foreign
and state loss carry-forwards expire in various years beginning in
2006.

The classification of deferred taxes as of
December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005 is as
follows:


Income tax expense (benefit)
attributable to continuing operations consisted of the
following:

Income
taxes paid during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $112.8  million,
$125.4  million and $11.2  million (net of $22.1
million US Federal refund), respectively. During 2005, the Company had
tax holidays only with Thailand. Tax holidays resulted in a $1.7
million reduction in tax expense in 2005, $3.0  million in 2004,
and $2.5  million in 2003. The tax holiday in Thailand is in
place until 2010.

The reconciliation of federal income tax
at the statutory federal rate to income tax at the effective rate for
continuing operations is as
follows:

The
components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes
consisted of the
following:

The
Company's future effective tax rates could be adversely affected
by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where the
statutory rates are lower. The Company is subject to the examination of
its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. The Company evaluates the likelihood of unfavorable
adjustments arising from the examinations and believes adequate
provisions have been made in the income tax
provision.

Undistributed foreign earnings of $249.7
million at December  31,  2005 are considered to be
invested indefinitely or will be remitted substantially free of
additional tax. Accordingly, no provision has been


made for taxes that might be payable upon
remittance of such earnings, nor is it practicable to determine the
amount of this liability.

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF
2004 — Repatriation of Foreign Earnings

The American
Jobs Creation Act, the ‘‘Act’’, enacted on
October  22,  2004 created a temporary incentive for U.S.
corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by
providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain
dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In 2005,
Stanley's Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved
a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the
‘‘Act’’ to repatriate $249.6  million
in foreign earnings in fiscal 2005. Stanley recorded $15.6
million in tax expense related to this $249.6  million dividend.
All repatriations under the ‘‘Act’’ were
completed by December  31,  2005.

R. COMMITMENTS AND
GUARANTEES

COMMITMENTS    The Company has
noncancelable operating lease agreements, principally related to
facilities, vehicles, machinery and equipment. Minimum payments have
not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $5.1  million due
in the future under noncancelable subleases. In addition, the Company
is a party to synthetic leasing programs which qualify as operating
leases, for two of its major distribution centers. Rental expense, net
of sublease income, for operating leases was $41.4  million in
2005, $38.7  million in 2004 and $43.0  million in
2003.

Outsourcing and other commitments are comprised of:
$34.3  million for outsourcing arrangements, primarily related to
information systems and telecommunications; $20.1  million in
marketing obligations; and $0.7  million of cash funding
commitments pertaining to the Company’s U.S. ESOP.

The following table includes the future commitments for lease
obligations, outsourcing and other
arrangements.

The
Company has numerous assets, predominantly vehicles and equipment,
under a one-year term renewable U.S. master personal property lease.
Residual value obligations under this master lease were $25.7
million at December  31,  2005 while the fair value of the
underlying assets was approximately $29.6  million. The U.S.
master personal property lease obligations are not reflected in the
future minimum lease payments since the initial and remaining term does
not exceed one year. The Company routinely exercises various lease
renewal options and from time to time purchases leased assets for fair
value at the end of lease terms.

The Company is a party to
synthetic leasing programs for two of its major distribution centers.
The programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, where
only the monthly lease cost is recorded in earnings and the liability
and value of underlying assets are off-balance sheet. As of
December  31,  2005, the estimated fair value of assets and
remaining obligations for these two properties were $48.3
million and $40.4  million, respectively.


GUARANTEES

The
Company has guaranteed a portion of the residual value arising from its
previously mentioned synthetic lease and U.S. master personal property
lease programs. The lease guarantees aggregate $66.1  million
while the fair value of the underlying assets is estimated at
$77.9  million. The related assets would be available to satisfy
the guarantee obligations and therefore it is unlikely the Company will
incur any future loss associated with these lease guarantees. The
Company has issued $26.6  million in standby letters of credit
that guarantee future payments which may be required under certain
insurance programs. Shares of the Company’s common stock held by
the ESOP were purchased with the proceeds of external borrowings in the
1980’s and borrowings from the Company in 1991. The external
ESOP borrowings are guaranteed by the Company and are included in
long-term debt. Shareowners’ equity reflects a reduction for the
internal and external borrowings. The Company has sold various
businesses and properties over many years and provided standard
indemnification to the purchasers with respect to any unknown
liabilities, such as environmental, which may arise in the future that
are attributable to the time of the Company’s ownership. No
liabilities have been recorded for these general indemnifications since
there are no identified exposures.

The Company provides
product and service warranties which vary across its businesses. The
types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited
lifetime, while certain products carry no warranty. Further, the
Company incurs discretionary costs to service its products in
connection with product performance issues. Historical warranty and
service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations
recognized. Adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new
information becomes available.

The changes in the carrying
amount of product and service warranties for the years ended
December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005 are
as
follows:


S. CONTINGENCIES

The
Company is involved in various legal proceedings relating to
environmental issues, employment, product liability and workers’
compensation claims and other matters. The Company periodically reviews
the status of these proceedings with both inside and outside counsel,
as well as an actuary for risk insurance. Management believes that the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on operations or financial condition taken as a
whole.

The Company recognizes liabilities for contingent
exposures when analysis indicates it is both probable that an asset has
been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
impairment or loss can reasonably be estimated. When a range of
probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely
amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is
considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued.

In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in
various lawsuits and claims. In addition, the Company is a party to a
number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies
relating to environmental remediation. Also, the Company, along with
many other companies, has been named as a potentially responsible party
(‘‘PRP’’) in a number of administrative
proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites, including 12
active Superfund sites. Current laws potentially impose joint and
several liability upon each PRP. In assessing its potential liability
at these sites, the Company has considered the following: the whether
responsibility is being disputed, the terms of existing agreements,
experience at similar sites, and the fact that the Company’s
volumetric contribution at these sites is relatively
small.

The Company’s policy is to accrue
environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded
is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to
each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology,
presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take
into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties.
As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the
amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As
of December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005,
the Company had reserves of $21.3  million and $13.6
million, respectively, for remediation activities associated with
Company-owned properties as well as for Superfund sites, for losses
that are probable and estimable. Of the 2005 amount, $3.4
million is classified as current and $17.9  million as long-term.
The range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably
possible is $19.4  million to $37.0  million which is
subject to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for
environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have
been recorded on those sites in accordance with
policy.

The environmental liability for certain sites that
have cash payments that are fixed or reliably determinable have been
discounted using a rate of 5.4%. The discounted and undiscounted
amount of the liability relative to these sites is $5.0  million
and $8.1  million, respectively, as of December  31,
2005 and $5.1  million and $8.2  million, respectively, as
of January  1,  2005. The payments relative to these sites
are expected to be $0.9  million in 2006, $1.7  million in
2007, $1.0  million in 2008, $0.3  million in 2009,
$0.3  million in 2010 and $3.9  million
thereafter.

The amount recorded for identified contingent
liabilities is based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed
periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred in
future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent
uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject to the
imprecision in estimating future contingent liability costs, the
Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection
with these matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a
materially adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

As previously disclosed in the
2002 Annual Report, the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December  28,  2002 include
$5.6  million, or 4¢ per fully diluted share, of
accounting corrections related primarily to expense capitalization and
depreciation in fiscal years


1999 through 2002. During the fourth quarter
of 2003 the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a formal order of
private investigation in connection with allegations regarding certain
accounting matters. These allegations, which had previously been raised
with the Company anonymously, were initially researched and evaluated
by the Company’s management, internal audit staff and
independent auditors, and subsequently, further investigated by a
second multinational accounting firm, all under the supervision of the
audit committee of the Board of Directors. This resulted in the
accounting corrections referred to above. The Company has cooperated
fully with the SEC throughout the investigation. Management, the Board
of Directors and the Company’s independent auditors concluded
that such corrections were immaterial, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, to the December  28,  2002 audited
Consolidated Financial Statements and immaterial to the previously
reported results of the prior years and quarters to which they
relate.

T. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

During
December  2005, the Company committed to a plan to divest of the
operations of two small businesses: its appliance hinge and U.K.
decorator tools businesses. The sales are expected to occur during
2006.

On October  15,  2004, the Company
entered into a definitive agreement to sell its home décor
business to Wellspring Capital Management LLC, a New York-based private
equity investment firm. The $87  million cash sale transaction
closed on December  4,  2004 and resulted in an after-tax
gain of $24  million.

In a definitive agreement
effective December  31,  2004, the Company sold Friess, its
German paint roller business, to Nespoli Groupe SpA for $6.4
million, and a loss of $3.6  million was recognized
thereon.

On December  8,  2003, the Company
entered into a definitive agreement to sell its residential entry door
business to Masonite International Corporation. The $161  million
cash sale transaction closed on March  2,  2004 and
resulted in an after-tax gain of $95  million.

In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
‘‘Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets’’, the results of operations of the appliance
hinge, U.K. decorator tools, home décor, Friess and residential
entry door businesses for the current and prior periods have been
reported as discontinued operations. In addition, the assets and
liabilities of the appliance hinge and U.K. decorator tools businesses
have been reclassified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets for both 2005 and 2004. The divestures of these businesses were
made pursuant to the Company’s growth strategy which entails a
reduction of risk associated with certain large customer concentrations
and better utilization of the Company’s resources to increase
shareowner value.

The appliance hinge business supplies
hardware necessary to manufacture large household appliances within
North America. The U.K. decorator tools business manufactures brushes,
rollers and other paint sundries that are supplied to various retailers
primarily in the United Kingdom. The home décor business
supplied mirrored closet doors, closet organization products and wall
décor products primarily through large retailers in North
America and Europe. The Friess business manufactured paint rollers in
Germany and sold them into the private label market in continental
Europe. The residential entry door business manufactured and
distributed steel and fiberglass entry doors and components throughout
North America. Operating results of the U.K. decorator tools, home
décor, Friess, and residential entry door businesses, which were
formerly included in the Consumer Products


segment, and the appliance hinge business,
which was formerly included in the Security Solutions segment, are
summarized as
follows:

During
2005, the Company also recorded several adjustments to previously
divested businesses in relation to the resolution of tax matters and
other contingencies. These adjustments resulted in an after-tax loss in
discontinued operations of $2.9  million.

Assets
and liabilities of the appliance hinge and U.K. decorator tools
businesses as of December  31,  2005 and January
1,  2005 are as
follows:

$0.3
million of goodwill is included in the assets held for sale that will
be relieved when the U.K. decorator tools business is
divested.

U. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
(Unaudited)

Effective January  1,  2006, the
Company completed the acquisition of Facom S.A.
(‘‘Facom’’) for 410  million euros
($486  million) which was financed with a combination of cash on
hand and debt issuance. Facom, based in France, is a leading European
manufacturer of hand and mechanics tools with annual revenues
approximating $445  million. Facom designs, manufactures and
markets the majority of its product range of tools to professional
automotive and industrial end users with its well-known industrial tool
brands: Facom

®

, Virax

®

and USAG

®

. Facom operates
primarily within the premium industrial and automotive tools sector in
Europe.

In January  2006, the Company announced its
plans to record a $16  million charge in 2006 for a cost
reduction initiative relating primarily for the severance of 540
employees across multiple businesses. The majority of the cost
reduction actions will be executed in the first quarter of
2006.

On January  25,  2006, the Company
announced a $200  million share repurchase program. The program
commenced on January  27,  2006 and is expected to be
completed during the first half of fiscal 2006.

On January 19,
2006, the Company's current preferred stock purchase rights
agreement was amended to, among other things, increase from 10%
to 15% the beneficial ownership level that any person or group
of persons may acquire before triggering the rights and to exclude any
person or group of persons who inadvertently acquires a beneficial
ownership level in excess of 14.9%. These rights would
therefore, in general, not be applicable unless a beneficial owner had
acquired 15% or more of the then outstanding shares of the
Company's common stock. Additionally, on January 19, 2006, the
Company extended its preferred stock purchase rights agreement until
March 10, 2016.


The foregoing description of the
amendment and the agreement does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the amendment and the
agreement which were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on a Current Report on Form 8-K on January 20, 2006 and a Current
Report on Form 8K/A filed on February 22, 2006, respectively.
