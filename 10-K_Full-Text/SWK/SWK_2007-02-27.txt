brands and

instances, through third party
distributors.

Competition

The
Company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality,
its well-known brands, its commitment to customer service, strong
customer relationships, the breadth of its product lines and its
emphasis on product innovation.

The Company encounters
active competition in all of its businesses from both larger and
smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services
or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. The
Company has a large number of competitors; however, aside from a small
number of competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware
businesses who produce a range of products somewhat comparable to the
Company’s, the majority of its competitors compete only with
respect to one or more individual products or product lines within a
particular segment. Certain large customers offer private label brands
(‘‘house brands’’) that compete across a wider
spectrum of the Company’s product offerings. The Company is one
of the largest manufacturers of hand tools in the world, featuring a
broader line of products than any other toolmaker. The Company is a
significant manufacturer of pneumatic fastening tools and related
fasteners to the construction, furniture and pallet industries as well
as a leading manufacturer of hand-held hydraulic tools used for heavy
construction, railroad, utilities and public works. The Company also
believes that it is among the largest direct providers of access
security integration services in North America.


Several of the Company’s
largest retail customers have elected to compete with the Company by
developing house brands and sourcing products (generally from low cost
countries).

Customers

A substantial
portion of the Company’s products are sold to home centers and
mass merchants in the U.S. and Europe. In 2006, net sales to The Home
Depot were 10% of the Company’s consolidated sales from
continuing operations. A consolidation of retailers both in North
America and abroad has occurred over time. While this consolidation and
the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers
provide the Company with opportunities for growth, the increasing size
and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of
exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of the customer referred to
above, or the loss of certain of the other larger home centers or mass
merchants as customers, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company until either such customers were replaced or the Company made
the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of
business.

Despite the trend toward customer consolidation,
the Company has been able to maintain a diversified customer base and
has decreased the potential customer concentration risk over the past
years, as sales from continuing operations in markets outside of the
home center and mass merchant distribution channels have grown at a
greater rate through a combination of efforts to broaden the customer
base, primarily in the Security Solutions and Industrial Tools
segments. In this regard, sales to the Company’s largest customer
as a percentage of the total Company’s sales have decreased from
22% to 10% since 2002.

Raw
Materials

The Company’s products are
manufactured of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals including, but not
limited to steel, aluminum, zinc, brass, copper and nickel, as well as
resin. Additionally, the Company uses other commodity based materials
for components and packaging including, but not limited to, plastics,
wood, and other corrugated products. The raw materials required are
available from a number of sources at competitive prices and the
Company has annual or quarterly spot contracts with many of its key
suppliers. Certain commodity prices, particularly energy related and
non-ferrous metals are expected to remain volatile in 2007, but the
Company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining supplies for any
raw materials used in its production
processes.

Backlog

Due to short
order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in most of the
Company’s Consumer Products and Industrial Tools businesses,
backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future
performance. At February  3,  2007, the Company had
approximately $347  million in unfilled orders compared with
$274  million in unfilled orders at February  5,
2006. All of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within
the current fiscal year. Most customers place orders for immediate
shipment and as a result, the Company produces primarily for inventory,
rather than to fill specific orders.

Patents and
Trademarks

No business segment is dependent, to any
significant degree, on patents, licenses, franchises or concessions and
the loss of these patents, licenses, franchises or concessions would
not have a material adverse effect on any of the business segments. The
Company owns numerous patents, none of which individually are material
to the Company’s operations as a whole. These patents expire at
various times over the next 20 years. The Company holds licenses,
franchises and concessions, none of which individually or in the
aggregate are material to the Company’s operations as a whole.
These licenses, franchises and concessions vary in duration, but
generally run from one to 20 years.

The Company has
numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide. The
STANLEY

®

and STANLEY in a notched rectangle design
trademarks are material to all three business segments. These
well-known trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are
among the world’s most trusted brand names. The Company’s
tagline, ‘‘Make Something

brand strategy for all segments. The Bostitch

indefinitely for like terms.

Environmental
Regulations

The Company is subject to various
environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries
where it has operations. Future laws and regulations are expected to be
increasingly stringent and will likely increase the Company’s
expenditures related to environmental matters.

The Company
is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state
regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation.
Additionally, the Company, along with many other companies, has been
named as a potentially responsible party
(‘‘PRP’’) in a number of administrative
proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites, including
fifteen active Superfund sites.

Current laws potentially
impose joint and several liabilities upon each PRP. In assessing its
potential liability at these sites, the Company has considered the
following: whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms of
existing agreements, experience at similar sites, and the
Company’s volumetric contribution at these
sites.

The Company’s policy is to accrue
environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded
is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to
each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology,
presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take
into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties.
As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the
amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As
of December  30,  2006, the Company had reserves of
approximately $31  million, for remediation activities associated
with Company-owned properties as well as for Superfund sites, for
losses that are probable and estimable.

The amount
recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates.
Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available.
Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the
estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental
exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future
environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may
have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the
amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

Employees

At
December  30,  2006, the Company had approximately 17,600
employees, nearly 8,200 of whom were employed in the U.S. Approximately
765 U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements
negotiated with 13 different local labor unions who are, in turn,
affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions.
The majority of the Company’s hourly-paid and weekly-paid
employees outside the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining
agreements. The Company’s labor agreements in the U.S. expire in
2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. There have been no significant
interruptions or curtailments of the Company’s operations in
recent years due to labor disputes. The Company believes that its
relationship with its employees is good.

1(d) FINANCIAL
INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

Financial information
regarding the Company’s geographic areas is incorporated herein
by reference to Note P Business Segments and Geographic Areas of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8.


1(e) AVAILABLE
INFORMATION

The Company’s website is located at
http://www.Stanleyworks.com. (This URL is intended to be an inactive
textual reference only. It is not intended to be an active hyperlink to
our website. The information on our website is not, and is not intended
to be, part of this Form 10-K and is not incorporated into this report
by reference.) Stanley makes its Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and amendments
to each available free of charge on its website as soon as reasonably
practicable after filing them with, or furnishing them to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 1A.    RISK
FACTORS

The Company’s business, operations and
financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You
should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below,
together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled
‘‘Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995’’, and in other documents
that the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, before making any investment decision with respect to its
securities. If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or
develop, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations and future growth prospects could change. Under these
circumstances, the trading prices of the Company’s securities
could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the
Company’s securities.

Large customer
concentration and related customer inventory adjustments may negatively
impact sales, results of operations and cash
flows.

The Company has certain significant customers,
particularly home centers and major retailers such as The Home Depot,
Lowe’s and Wal-Mart. The Home Depot individually accounted for
10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales from
continuing operations for the year ended December  30,
2006. The loss or material reduction of business from, or the lack of
success of sales initiatives for the Company’s products related
to, any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact
on the Company’s results of operations and cash
flows.

In addition, unanticipated inventory adjustments by
such customers can have a negative impact on sales. For example, severe
inventory adjustments taken by certain large North American home center
customers in December  2005 negatively impacted sales by
approximately $30  million versus normal levels. While the
Company did not experience a significant impact from such customer
inventory adjustments in late 2006, they may re-occur in the
future.

Customer consolidation could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business.

A
substantial portion of the Company’s products in the Consumer
Products and Industrial Tools segments are sold through home centers
and mass merchant distribution channels. A consolidation of retailers
in both North America and abroad has occurred over time and the
increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of
exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of certain larger home
centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business until either such customers were replaced or
the Company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss
of business.

The Company’s growth and
repositioning strategies include acquisitions. The Company’s
recent acquisitions may not further its strategies and the Company may
not be able to identify suitable future acquisition
candidates.

In 2002, the Company embarked on a growth
strategy to shift its business portfolio toward favored growth markets
through acquisitions and divestitures, and thereby to reduce the risk
associated with large customer concentrations. The strategy has been
advanced over the last five years with the sales of the Company’s
residential entry door and home décor businesses, and the
acquisition of a number of companies, including HSM Electronic
Protection Services, Inc. (‘‘HSM’’), Facom
S.A. (‘‘Facom’’), National Manufacturing
Co. (‘‘National’’), Besco Pneumatic
Corporation (‘‘Besco’’), Best Lock
Corporation and its affiliates (‘‘Best
Access’’), Chicago Steel Tape Co. and affiliates
(‘‘CST/Berger’’), Blick plc
(‘‘Blick’’), Frisco Bay Industries Ltd
(‘‘Frisco Bay’’), ISR Solutions, Inc.
(‘‘ISR’’), Security Group, Inc.
(‘‘Security Group’’) and Precision
Hardware, Inc.
(‘‘Precision’’).


Although the Company has extensive
experience with acquisitions, there can be no assurance that recently
acquired companies will be successfully integrated and effectively
implement the Company’s growth and repositioning strategy. If
the Company successfully integrates the acquired companies and
effectively implements its repositioning strategy, there can be no
assurance that its resulting business segments will enjoy continued
market acceptance or profitability.

In addition, there can
be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully identify
suitable future acquisition candidates, negotiate appropriate terms,
obtain the necessary financing, complete the transactions or
successfully integrate the new company as necessary to continue its
growth and repositioning strategies.

The
Company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its
business and operations.

The Company has made a
number of acquisitions in the past three years, including, but not
limited to: HSM in January  2007, Besco in July  2006,
Facom in January  2006, National in November  2005,
Precision in May  2005, Security Group in January  2005,
ISR in December  2004, Frisco Bay in March  2004, as well
as CST/Berger and Blick in January  2004. The Company may make
additional acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions involve a number of
risks, including:

•

the diversion of
Company management’s attention and other
resources,

•

the incurrence of unexpected
liabilities, and

•

the loss of key
personnel and clients or customers of acquired
companies.

Any intangible assets that the Company acquires
may have a negative effect on its earnings and return on capital
employed. In addition, the success of the Company’s future
acquisitions will depend in part on its ability
to:

•

combine
operations,

•

integrate departments,
systems and procedures, and

•

obtain cost
savings and other efficiencies from the
acquisitions.

Failure to effectively consummate or manage
future acquisitions may adversely affect the Company’s existing
businesses and harm its operational results. The Company is still in
the process of integrating the businesses and operations of Facom,
National, Besco, HSM and other acquisitions with its existing
businesses and operations. The Company cannot ensure that such
integrations will be successfully completed, or that all of the planned
synergies will be realized.

The Company may incur
significant additional indebtedness, or issue additional equity
securities, in connection with future acquisitions which may restrict
the manner in which it conducts business. The potential issuance of
such securities may limit the Company’s ability to implement
elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on
earnings.

As more fully described in Item 7 and Note
I Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company issued
$450  million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities through its
Trust subsidiary in 2005, the net proceeds of which were used to
finance a portion of the acquisitions of Facom and National. In
addition, the Company has a five year revolving credit agreement,
enabling borrowings up to $550  million; this agreement includes
provisions that allow designated subsidiaries to borrow up to
$250  million in Euros and Pound Sterling, which may be available
to, among other things, fund acquisitions.

On
January  8,  2007 the Company entered into a new
$500  million 364-day bridge facility which was utilized to
partially finance the $545  million HSM acquisition on
January  16,  2007. The Company intends to permanently
refinance this bridge facility in 2007 with a combination of available
cash, and the issuance of long-term debt and equity-linked
securities.


The instruments and agreements
governing certain of the Company’s current indebtedness contain
restrictive covenants that include, among other
things:

•

a limitation on creating liens
on certain property of the Company and its
subsidiaries;

•

maintenance of specified
financial ratios. Failure to maintain such ratios could result in
limiting further access to liquidity and requiring the Company to pay
all interest coupons on certain debt securities through the issuance of
common stock before making further dividend payments on its common
shares outstanding;

•

a restriction on
entering into certain sale-leaseback transactions;
and

•

customary events of default. If an
event of default occurs and is continuing, the Company might be
required to repay all amounts outstanding under the respective
instrument or agreement.

Future new instruments and
agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive
covenants. Such covenants could restrict the Company in the manner in
which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of
its growth and repositioning strategies.

The
Company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and
violation of its trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact
sales and brand reputation.

The Company’s
trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important
to its success and competitive position. Unauthorized imitation of its
products or unauthorized use of its trademark rights may not only erode
sales of the Company’s products, but may also cause significant
damage to its brand name and reputation, its ability to effectively
represent the Company to its customers, contractors, suppliers, and/or
licensees, as well as divert management time and attention. There can
be no assurance that the Company’s on-going effort to protect
its brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations. In
addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries
may not allow the Company to protect its proprietary rights to the same
extent as it is able to in the United States.

The
Company has trademark licensing programs and licensees may not comply
with product quality, manufacturing standards, marketing and other
requirements.

The Company licenses certain of its
trademarks to third parties for manufacturing, marketing, distribution
and sale of various products. While it enters into comprehensive
licensing agreements with its licensees covering product design,
product quality, sourcing, manufacturing, marketing and other
requirements, such licensees may not comply fully with those
agreements. Non-compliance could include marketing products under the
Company’s brand names that do not meet its quality and other
requirements or engaging in manufacturing practices that do not meet
the Company’s supplier code of conduct. These activities could
harm brand equity, reputation and business.

Successful
sales and marketing efforts depend on the Company’s ability to
recruit and retain qualified employees.

The success
of the Company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the
contributions and abilities of key executives, its sales force and
other personnel, including the ability of its sales force to adapt to
any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate
customer coverage. The Company must therefore continue to recruit,
retain and motivate management, sales and other personnel sufficient to
maintain its current business and support its projected growth. A
shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the Company’s
ability to implement its growth strategy.

The Company
faces active competition and if it does not compete effectively, its
business may suffer.

The Company faces active competition
and resulting pricing pressures. The Company’s products compete
on the basis of, among other things, its reputation for product
quality, its well-known brands, price, innovation and customer service
capabilities. The Company competes with both larger and smaller
companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that
produce different products appropriate for the same uses. These
companies are often located in countries such as China,


Taiwan and India where labor and other
production costs are substantially lower than in the United States,
Canada and Western Europe. Also, certain large customers offer private
label brands that compete with some of the Company’s product
offerings as a lower-cost alternative. To remain profitable and defend
market share, the Company must maintain a competitive cost structure,
develop new products and services, respond to competitor innovations
and enhance its existing products in a timely manner. The Company may
not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all
of its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material
adverse effect on its sales and profit margins.

The Stanley
Fulfillment System (‘‘SFS’’) is a continuous
operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the
Company’s business such as procurement, quality in manufacturing,
maximizing customer fill rates, integrating acquisitions and other key
businesses processes. In the event the Company is not successful in
effectively applying the SFS disciplines to its key business processes
its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely
affected.

In addition, the Company may have to reduce
prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay
competitive and retain market share. The Company engages in
restructuring actions, sometimes entailing shifts of production to low
cost countries, as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost
structure. If the Company does not execute restructuring actions well,
its ability to meet customer demand may decline, or earnings may
otherwise be adversely impacted; similarly if such efforts to reform
the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market
factors the Company may lose market share and profits.

The Company’s results of operations could be
negatively impacted by inflation in the cost of raw materials, freight
and energy.

The Company’s products are
manufactured of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals, including but not
limited to steel, aluminum, zinc, brass, nickel and copper, as well as
resin. Additionally, the Company uses other commodity based materials
for components and packaging including, but not limited to: plastics,
wood, and other corrugated products. As described in more detail in
Item 7 hereto, the Company has been negatively impacted by commodity
and freight inflation in recent years and it expects energy and certain
commodity prices, particularly non-ferrous metals, to increase. If the
Company is unable to mitigate these inflation increases through various
customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives, its
profitability may be adversely affected.

Ultimate
income tax payments may differ from amounts currently recorded by the
Company.  Future tax law changes may materially
increase the Company’s prospective income tax
expense.

The Company is subject to income
taxation in the United States as well as numerous foreign
jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the
Company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there
are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax
determination is uncertain. The Company is routinely
audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions.
Although management believes the recorded tax estimates
are reasonable, the ultimate outcome from any audit (or
related litigation) could be materially different from amounts
reflected in the Company’s income tax provisions and
accruals. Future settlements of income tax audits may
have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial
recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the
point of ultimate tax audit settlement. Additionally, it is
possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that
could have a material impact on the Company’s worldwide income
tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes
effective.

The Company’s failure to continue to
successfully manage, defend, litigate and accrue for claims and
litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash
flows.

As described in further detail in Items 1 and
3 and Note S Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8, the Company becomes involved in various
litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its
business, including, from time to time, litigation relating to such
items as commercial transactions, product liability, workers
compensation, the Company’s distributors, intellectual property
claims, regulatory actions and environmental matters. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to continue to successfully
manage and


defend such matters. In addition, given the
inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures, actual costs to
be incurred in future periods may vary from the Company’s
estimates for such contingent liabilities.

The Company
is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuation which could negatively impact
profitability.

Exposure to foreign currency risk
results because the Company, through its global operations, enters into
transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies.
The Company’s predominant exposures are in European, Canadian
and Asian currencies, including the Chinese Renminbi
(‘‘RMB’’). In preparing its financial
statements, for foreign operations with functional currencies other
than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at
current exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated using
weighted average exchange rates. With respect to the effects on
translated earnings, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local
currencies, the Company’s earnings could be negatively impacted.
Although the Company utilizes risk management tools, including hedging,
as it deems appropriate, to mitigate a portion of potential market
fluctuations in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that such
measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation
exposure will be eliminated. The Company does not make a practice of
hedging its non U.S. Dollar earnings.

In addition, on
July  21,  2005, China announced it will let the RMB
fluctuate within a very tight band (+/− .3% around
weighted average prior day close) thereby effectively adopting a
managed float and ending its decade-old valuation de facto peg to the
U.S. dollar. The Company sources significant products from China
and other Asian low cost countries for resale in other
regions. To the extent the RMB or these other currencies
appreciate with respect to the U.S. dollar, the Company may experience
cost increases on such purchases. While the present 3%
appreciation of the RMB should not generate material cost increases for
RMB denominated purchases, further appreciation of this or other
currencies utilized for procurement could adversely affect
profitability. The Company may not be successful at implementing
customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related
cost increases.

The Company’s business is
subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing
overseas.

The Company imports large quantities of
finished goods, components and raw materials. Substantially all of its
import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs
and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral
actions. In addition, the countries in which the Company’s
products and materials are manufactured or imported from may from time
to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions
on its imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Imports are
also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may
increase the Company’s cost of goods sold. Adverse changes in
these import costs and restrictions, or the Company’s
suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar
laws, could harm the Company’s business.

The
Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of
international trade agreements and regulations such as the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and the activities and regulations of
the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally
have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and
cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas
assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade
agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the
Company’s business, such as setting quotas on products that may
be imported from a particular country into key markets such as the U.S.
or the European Union.

The Company’s ability to import
products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by
conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and
warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor
disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in
the U.S. and other countries. These issues could delay importation of
products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or
warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These
alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in
higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the
Company’s business and financial
condition.


If the Company were required
to write down all or part of its goodwill, indefinite-lived tradenames,
or other definite-lived intangible assets, its net income and net worth
could be materially adversely affected.

As a result
of acquisitions, the Company has $1.1  billion of goodwill,
$298  million of indefinite-lived tradenames, and $223
million of definite-lived intangible assets recorded on its
Consolidated Balance Sheet at December  30,  2006. The
Company is required to periodically, at least annually, determine if
its goodwill or indefinite-lived tradenames have become impaired, in
which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible
asset. The definite-lived intangible assets, including customer
relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives; such
assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate. Impairment
of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside the
Company’s control, such as technological change, intensified
competition or other matters causing a decline in expected future cash
flows. If the Company were required to write down all or part of its
goodwill, indefinite-lived tradenames, or other definite-lived
intangible assets, its net income and net worth could be materially
adversely affected.

If the investments in employee
benefit plans do not perform as expected, the Company may have to
contribute additional amounts to these plans, which would otherwise be
available to cover operating and other expenses. Certain U.S. employee
benefit plan expense is affected by the market value of the
Company’s common stock.

As described in
further detail in Note M Employee Benefit Plans of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company sponsors
pension and other post retirement defined benefit plans, as well as an
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (‘‘ESOP’’)
under which the primary U.S. defined contribution and 401(k) plans are
funded. The Company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently
invested in equity securities, bonds and other fixed income securities,
and money market instruments. The Company’s funding policy is to
contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide
for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which
require, among other things, that the Company make cash contributions
to under funded pension plans. The Company expects to contribute
approximately $13  million to its pension and other post
retirement defined benefit plans in 2007.

There can be no
assurance that the value of the plan assets, or the investment returns
on those plan assets, will be sufficient in the future. It is therefore
possible that the Company may be required to make significant
additional cash contributions to the plans which would reduce the cash
available for other business purposes, or that the Company will have to
recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would
decrease the net assets of the Company.

Overall ESOP
expense is affected by the market value of Stanley stock on the monthly
dates when shares are released, among other factors. Net ESOP expense
amounted to $2  million in each of the years 2006, 2005 and 2004.
While the average market value of shares released increased from $43.20
in 2004 to $49.28 in 2006, other elements of ESOP expense, including a
gradual reduction in the number of shares released annually from the
trust, offset the favorable impact of the higher share price.
 ESOP expense could increase in the future if the market value
of the Company’s common stock declines.

The Company
provides a 5% guaranteed rate of return on participant
contributions made to the tax deferred 401(K) savings plan prior to
July  1998 when all contributions were invested in Stanley common
stock. The value of the shares purchased by participants prior to
July  1998 along with the 5% cumulative guaranteed rate of
return on Stanley common stock is known as an Investment Protection
Account (‘‘IPA’’). Beginning in July
1998 the investment options for plan participant contributions were
enhanced to include a variety of investment funds in addition to the
Company’s common stock, and there is no guaranteed rate of
return to participants on any contributions made after that time. The
IPA guarantee is included in the actuarial valuation of the ongoing
U.S. pension plan. Payments related to the IPA guarantees, if they have
any value, would be made to participants over a period of many years
generally as they retire. In the event the market value of Stanley
common stock declines below $43.59 (which is the stock price at which
there was a settlement of this liability) additional costs may be
triggered by the IPA benefit guarantee.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The Company
is a worldwide supplier of consumer products, industrial tools and
security solutions for professional, commercial, industrial and
consumer use. Its operations are classified into three business
segments: Consumer Products, Industrial Tools and Security Solutions.
The Consumer Products segment manufactures and markets hand tools,
consumer mechanics tools, storage units and hardware. These products
are sold primarily to professional end users and distributed through
retailers (including home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and
retail lumber yards). The Industrial Tools segment manufactures and
markets professional mechanics and hand tools, pneumatic tools and
fasteners, storage systems, plumbing, heating, air conditioning and
roofing tools, hydraulic tools and accessories, assembly tools and
systems, and electronic leveling and measuring tools. These products
are sold to customers and distributed primarily through third party
distributors as well as through direct sales forces. The Security
Solutions segment is a provider of access and security solutions
primarily for retailers, educational, financial and healthcare
institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and industrial
customers. The Company provides an extensive suite of mechanical and
electronic security products and systems including automatic doors,
door closers, access controls, exit devices, software and locking
mechanisms, as well as a variety of security services, security
integration, related installation and maintenance
services.

For several years, the Company has focused on a
profitable growth strategy and begun to transform itself from a mature
160 year old ‘‘American tool company’’, to
an innovative, multi-national, diversified, industrial growth business.
This strategy has included approximately $2  billion of
acquisitions since the beginning of 2002, several key divestitures, the
reduction of risk associated with certain large customer concentrations
and increased brand investments. Additionally, the strategy reflects
management’s vision to build a growth platform in security while
expanding the valuable branded tools and hardware platforms. Over the
past several years, the Company has generated strong free cash flow and
received substantial proceeds from divestitures that were utilized to
invest in the transformation of the business portfolio.


Free cash flow, as defined in the
following table, was $359  million in 2006, $294  million
in 2005, and $317  million in 2004, considerably exceeding net
earnings from continuing operations. The Company believes free cash
flow is an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability
to fund future growth and provide a dividend to
shareowners.

The
Company strives to reinvest its free cash flow in high return
businesses in order to generate strong return on assets and improve
working capital efficiency. Significant areas of tactical emphasis
related to execution of this strategy and its ability to generate free
cash flow, as well as events impacting the Company’s financial
performance in 2006 and 2005, are discussed below.

CONTINUED
GROWTH OF SECURITY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS

The Company
further advanced its strategy of becoming a global market leader in the
commercial security industry. Annual revenues of the Security Solutions
segment have grown to $887  million, or 22% of 2006 sales,
up from $105  million, or 5% of 2001 sales. Key events
pertaining to the growth of this segment in the past two years include
the following:

•

The Company completed the
acquisition of HSM Electronic Protection Services, Inc.
(‘‘HSM’’) in January  2007 for
approximately $545  million in cash. HSM, based near Chicago,
Illinois, is a market leader in the security monitoring industry, and
has annual revenues of approximately $200  million. HSM has a
stable customer base, an extensive North American field network and the
second largest market share in the U.S. commercial monitoring market.
The acquisition will serve as a growth platform in the monitoring
sector of the security industry. Management anticipates HSM will be
neutral to 2007 earnings, increasing to 20 to 25 cents per diluted
share earnings in 2009, with approximately $38  million of
non-cash intangible asset amortization occurring in 2007 related to
acquired contracts.

•

During 2006, the
Company completed three bolt-on acquisitions for a combined purchase
price of $22  million. Automatic Entrances of Colorado, Inc.
(‘‘Automatic Entrances’’) is a distributor
that sells, installs and services automatic doors and gates in several
western states in the U.S., and Automatic Doors Systems, Inc.
(‘‘Automatic Doors) is an automatic door distributor that
operates in the southeastern U.S. Both of these acquisitions were
integrated into the branch structure of the existing automatic doors
business and increase its geographic scope. GDX Technologies Ltd.
(‘‘GDX’’) is a leading access control
supplier in the United Kingdom that possesses strong technological
product development capabilities. GDX complements the existing European
security integration business.

•

In
January  2005, U.S. based Security Group, Inc.
(‘‘Security Group’’) was acquired for
approximately $50  million. Security Group is comprised of two
primary operating companies: Sargent & Greenleaf, Inc. and The
SafeMasters Co., Inc. Sargent & Greenleaf, Inc. is a manufacturer
of medium and high security locks and locking systems for the
financial, government and retail markets. The SafeMasters Co., Inc. is
a North American access control provider offering a wide variety of
physical security installation, maintenance and repair services, with
emphasis on mechanical locking
systems.

•

In May  2005, the Company
completed the acquisitions of Precision Hardware, Inc.
(‘‘Precision’’) and Sielox Security Systems
Pty Ltd (‘‘Sielox’’), for a combined
purchase price of $48  million. Precision manufactures and
distributes exit devices, door closers and security hardware in the
United States and provides a complementary product offering to the
Company’s existing mechanical access business. Australian-based
Sielox specializes in the installation and servicing of electronic
security systems for new construction projects.


The above acquisitions complement
the existing Security Solutions’ product offering, increase its
scale and strengthen the value proposition offered to end user
customers as industry dynamics favor multi-solution providers that
offer ‘‘one-stop shopping’’ capabilities.
The Company continues to focus on integrating the acquired businesses
as it expands the suite of its security product and service offerings.
In 2006 and 2005, various process improvement initiatives were
initiated including integration of overlapping field service
organizations and implementation of certain common back office systems.
These integration efforts will continue for the next two
years.

DRIVE FURTHER PROFITABLE GROWTH IN BRANDED TOOLS AND
HARDWARE

While diversifying the business portfolio
through expansion into Security Solutions is important, management also
recognizes that the branded consumer products and industrial tools
businesses are the foundations on which the Company was established and
provide strong growth and cash flow generation prospects. While these
businesses are strong and profitable today, management is committed to
growing these businesses through innovative product development, brand
support and relentless focus on global cost competitiveness in order to
maintain vitality over the long term. Acquisition-related growth will
also be pursued where appropriate. The following matters affected these
businesses:

•

The Company has rigorously
focused on innovation in order to enhance its product development
pipeline and reduce commercialization cycle time. In 2005, 350 new SKUs
were successfully launched including the AntiVibe

®

Hammer, Quickslide

®

Knife and
FatMax

®

Hacksaw. Innovation continued in 2006 with
the successful launch of the largest new hand tools product
introduction in the Company’s history. The
FatMax

®

Xtreme

™

product line
commenced shipping at the end of March  2006 and was supplemented
by a second phase roll-out initiated in September  2006, which
included the initial launch of
FatMax

®

XL

™

in European
markets.

•

In January  2006, the
Company completed the acquisition of Facom S.A.
(‘‘Facom’’) for 407  million euros
($480  million) which was financed with a combination of cash on
hand and debt issuance. Facom, based in France, is a leading European
manufacturer of hand and mechanics tools with annual revenues
approximating $475  million. Facom designs, manufactures and
markets the majority of its tool product offerings to professional
automotive and industrial end users with its well-known industrial tool
brands: Facom

®

, Virax

®

and
USAG

®

. Facom operates primarily within the premium
industrial and automotive tools sector in Europe, while the
Company’s pre-existing European customer base is focused mainly
on the construction and D-I-Y
(‘‘do-it-yourself’’) channels. As a result,
the two businesses complement each other and benefit from joint efforts
in areas such as product sourcing and procurement.

•

On November  30,  2005,
National Manufacturing Co. (‘‘National’’)
was acquired for $174  million. National is a leading North
American manufacturer and supplier of builders’ hardware,
marketing the majority of its products through the two-step cooperative
channel to the builder trade. National serves over 25,000 outlets with
manufacturing operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and has annual
revenues of approximately $175  million.

•

During 2006, the Company continued to focus
on the integration of the recent Facom and National acquisitions with
dedicated integration teams. Cost reduction actions for National
resulted in the severance of 240 employees, rationalization of
distribution processes and transitioning of certain manufacturing
activities to Asia. The cost reduction actions and integration will
continue throughout 2007. Facom is profitable and has experienced a
long history of success in professional markets in Europe, especially
in France and Italy. Nonetheless, many of its products are subject to
competitive forces that will likely require a significant reformation
of its cost structure and that of existing Stanley Europe. Management
is committed to performing such a reformation in order to ensure the
long-term competitiveness and preservation of the Facom and Stanley
tool franchises in Europe. During 2006, the Company completed a
consultation process with its European Works Council


regarding the reorganization of its Facom and
Stanley hand tools activities in Europe (these
‘‘Initiatives’’). These initiatives will,
among other things, implement growth strategies and reduce costs by
rationalizing manufacturing, logistics, sales and support
organizations. It will result in the severance of approximately 580
employees, the closure of two legacy Facom factories in France and four
legacy Facom distribution centers located in the United Kingdom,
Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. The Company estimates approximately
$75  million in cash expenditures will be incurred for these
Initiatives, the majority of which has been recorded in the Facom
purchase price allocation. These Initiatives commenced during the
latter half of 2006 and implementation will continue throughout
2007.

•

In July  2006, the Company
acquired approximately 67% of the outstanding shares of Besco
Pneumatic Corporation (‘‘Besco’’), a
leading manufacturer of pneumatic tools for $38  million in cash.
Over the next five years, the Company will have the option to increase
its ownership by an additional 15% to an ultimate ownership of
82%. Besco, which is headquartered in Taiwan and also has
operations in China, possesses state-of-the-art research and
development capabilities and efficient production facilities. Besco was
one of Stanley fastening system’s significant suppliers and
approximately half of its 2005 sales of $38  million were to the
Company. The acquisition is a key step in reducing the fastening
systems business’ existing cost structure and will facilitate
the pursuit of business in emerging markets aided by Besco’s
brand strength in Asia.

CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE STANLEY
BRAND

The Stanley

®

brand is
recognized as one of the world’s great brands and is one of the
Company’s most valuable assets. Brand support was increased
during 2006, 2005 and 2004, including television advertising campaigns
associated with new product roll-outs, continued NASCAR racing
sponsorships as well as more print and web-based advertising that
generated approximately one billion brand impressions annually. These
advertising and marketing campaigns yielded strong results as evidenced
by various hand tools metrics during 2006: web traffic increase of
31%; sales lead increase of 9%; brand awareness increase
of 30% and intent to buy increase of 30% versus 2005.

INSTITUTIONALIZE THE STANLEY FULFILLMENT
SYSTEM

The Company continued to practice the
operating disciplines specified by the Stanley Fulfillment System
(‘‘SFS’’), which is a continuous
operational improvement process committed to increasing customer and
shareowner value. SFS’s core disciplines consist of striving to
achieve perfect quality, service excellence, optimal cost, and
environmental health & safety. The Company applies SFS to many
aspects of its business including procurement, maximizing customer fill
rates, acquisition integration, and other key business processes. The
SFS program helped to mitigate the impact of material price inflation
that was experienced in recent years. In 2007, the Company plans to
expand its efforts to leverage SFS across the enterprise with the
intent of increasing working capital turns, decreasing cycle times, and
increasing customer
satisfaction.

Aside
from the strategic commentary above, four other matters having a
significant impact on the Company’s results were inflation,
currency exchange rate fluctuations, share repurchase and stock option
expensing.

The Company has been negatively impacted by
inflation, primarily commodity and freight, which has increased costs
by approximately $85  million over the past two years. During
this period, the Company has recovered approximately 68% of the
cost increase through pricing actions, and largely offset the remainder
through various cost reduction initiatives. The Company expects the
negative impact of inflation during 2007 will be in the range of $60
— $65  million, and plans to recover more than two-thirds
of this impact through pricing, and offset the remainder through
productivity actions.

In recent years, the strengthening
of foreign currencies had a favorable impact on the translation of
foreign currency-denominated operating results into U.S. dollars. It is
estimated that the favorable impact of foreign currency translation,
including acquired companies, contributed $0.04 and $0.12 of


diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations in 2005 and 2004, and had no effect on 2006 earnings per
share. This impact was principally from the Canadian dollar and Asian
currencies in 2005 and European currencies in 2004. Fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may have a
significant impact on future earnings, either positive or negative.

During 2006, the Company repurchased 4  million
outstanding shares of its common stock for $200  million. This
stock repurchase program was accretive to diluted earnings per share by
approximately 13 cents in 2006. This was partially offset by the
issuance of 2.1  million shares of common stock under various
employee plans.

In 2006, the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),
‘‘Share-Based Payment’’
(‘‘SFAS 123R’’), which requires all
share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
based on their fair values as they are earned by the employees under
the vesting terms. Pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company
recognized $9  million of non-cash, pre-tax stock option
compensation expense in 2006, which negatively impacted diluted
earnings per share by 7  cents compared to the corresponding 2005
period.  Refer to Note A Significant Accounting Policies of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
of the adoption of SFAS  123R.

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

Below is a summary of the Company’s
operating results at the consolidated level, followed by an overview of
business segment performance. The terms
‘‘organic’’ and
‘‘core’’ are utilized to describe results
aside from the significant impact of acquisitions and do not include
their results of operations until they have reached their respective
one year anniversary dates. This ensures appropriate comparability to
operating results of prior periods.

Net
Sales:

Net sales from continuing operations were $4.019
billion in 2006, as compared to $3.285  billion in 2005, a
22% increase. Acquisitions contributed 21% or $689
million of the sales increase. Organic sales increased 1% driven
by relatively consistent volume, pricing levels and foreign currency
impact compared to the prior year. The organic increase was generated
by share gains achieved in the consumer hand tools and automatic doors
businesses offset by price and volume declines experienced in the
fastening systems business. Favorable foreign currency translation in
the Americas and Europe was partially offset by a negative impact from
Asia.

Net sales from continuing operations were
$3.285  billion in 2005, as compared to $2.997  billion in
2004, a 10% increase. Acquisitions contributed 6% or
$167  million of the sales increase. Organic sales increased
4% driven by 2% volume growth, 1% favorable
foreign currency and a 1% positive pricing impact. The organic
volume growth was attributed to strong Consumer Products demand based
on successful consumer hand tool and garage storage new product
introductions, as well as increases in several Industrial Tools
businesses, principally industrial mechanics tools, hydraulic tools,
leveling / measuring tools and fastening systems. Favorable foreign
currency translation in Canada and Asia increased net sales by
1%.

Gross Profit:

The Company reported
gross profit from continuing operations of $1.459  billion, or
36% of net sales, in 2006, compared to $1.181  billion, or
36% of net sales, in the prior year. The acquired businesses
increased gross profit by $265  million. Included in the 2006
gross profit is the unfavorable impact of $22  million in
non-cash inventory step-up charges related to the initial turnover of
acquired inventory. Gross profit for 2006 was 37% of net sales
excluding this non-recurring item, primarily due to the positive impact
of the Facom acquisition. Core gross profit as a percentage of net
sales was 36% in 2006, which was consistent with the prior year.
The benefits of prior cost reduction actions, productivity improvements
from the Stanley Fulfillment System, and pricing actions offset
continued margin pressure from commodity and other inflation which
resulted in approximately $48  million of additional costs, and a
decline in fastening systems. The Company expects inflation to increase
2007 costs by approximately $60 – $65  million, which
management plans to mitigate through various customer pricing actions
and continued cost reduction and productivity initiatives. The
fastening systems’ gross profit decline reflected lower sales
volumes, a result of weakening housing


markets and price erosion, as well as a
commitment to shed unprofitable business; gross profit in this business
was further impacted by commodity cost inflation. Management launched
an extensive cost reduction initiative with the objective to return
fastening systems’ to acceptable profitability over a two year
period.

The Company reported gross profit from continuing
operations of $1.181  billion, or 36% of net sales, in
2005, compared to $1.104  billion, or 37% of net sales, in
the prior year. Acquisitions increased gross profit by $52
million. The remaining $25  million improvement was primarily
attributed to the increase in organic sales volume and continued
benefits of the Stanley Fulfillment System. As a percentage of sales,
the year over year gross margin rate decline primarily stems from
unfavorable mix and cost absorption in the fastening business, and to a
lesser extent the impact of recently acquired businesses which possess
lower gross margin percentages until integration synergies are
realized. During 2005, there was carryover of commodity inflation from
2004 which resulted in approximately $40  million of additional
costs that were mostly recovered through favorable pricing actions and
cost reduction initiatives.

SG&A
expenses:

Selling, general and administrative expenses from
continuing operations were $955  million, or 24% of net
sales, in 2006, compared to $737  million, or 22% of net
sales, in the prior year. The increase of $218  million primarily
relates to acquired businesses that increased costs by $192
million, $11  million of increased non-cash stock compensation
expense principally associated with the adoption of stock option
expensing during 2006, and $11  million of increased brand
support. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A as a percentage of sales
increased slightly to 23% of net sales compared with 22%
in 2005 due to the items described above, partially offset by benefits
received from prior restructuring actions.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were
$737  million, or 22% of net sales, in 2005, compared to
$691  million, or 23% of net sales, in the prior year. The
increase of $46  million mainly pertains to acquired businesses
that increased costs by $34  million, and $14  million of
increased brand support. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A as a
percentage of sales decreased 50 basis points compared with 2004 levels
despite the higher brand support expense due to sales volume leverage,
lower Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs and effective cost
controls.

Interest and Other-net:

Net interest
expense from continuing operations in 2006 was $65  million,
compared to $34  million in 2005. The increase was mainly due to
the November  2005 issuance of $450  million in junior
subordinated debt securities to fund acquisitions, and to a lesser
extent increased commercial paper borrowings resulting primarily from
the execution of the $200  million share repurchase program in
the first half of 2006, along with higher applicable short-term
interest rates. Interest expense will increase in 2007 due to
borrowings associated with the January 2007 acquisition of HSM for $545
million; the earlier discussed net earnings expectations for HSM
contemplate the interest costs related to financing the
acquisition.

Net interest expense from continuing
operations in 2005 was $34  million, consistent with 2004 levels.
Interest expense was held fairly constant in a period of rising
interest rates through the maintenance of overall lower debt levels
during most of 2005 and application of effective hedging
strategies.

Other-net from continuing operations
represented $57  million of expense in 2006 compared to
$48  million of expense in 2005. The increase was primarily
driven by $9  million of higher intangible asset amortization
expense associated with acquisition activity, a $4  million
pension plan curtailment charge in the U.K., and a $5  million
increase in foreign currency losses, partially offset by lower
environmental expense and decreased losses on the sale of fixed
assets.

Other-net from continuing operations represented
$48  million of expense in 2005, an increase of $2  million
over 2004. The slight increase was primarily driven by $6
million of higher intangible asset amortization associated with
acquisition activity partially offset by lower foreign currency
losses.

Income Taxes:

The Company’s
effective income tax rate from continuing operations for 2006 was
21% as compared to 24% for 2005 and 27% for
2004.

The lower effective tax rate in the current year
compared to 2005 is driven by the realization of credits against U.S.
taxes and the inclusion of the European-based Facom acquisition.
Additionally,


substantial costs were incurred in 2005 for
the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation
Act and such costs were not incurred in 2006. It is anticipated the
2007 effective tax rate will increase to within a 25% to
27% range, in part because certain credits affecting the 2006
and 2005 tax rate will not re-occur.

The decrease in the
effective income tax rate in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects a higher
proportion of taxable income in countries with lower statutory rates,
as well as the recording of a $5  million tax benefit pertaining
to the execution of tax planning strategies enabling the reduction of a
previously provided valuation allowance on future utilization of
certain prior year European net operating losses. Also, a $17
million tax benefit was recorded arising from the final settlement of
various tax contingencies based on the resolution of income tax audits
in 2005. In October  2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(the ‘‘Act’’) was signed into law. The Act
created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent deduction for certain
dividends received from controlled foreign corporations. During 2005,
the Company repatriated $250  million in foreign earnings and
recorded $16  million of tax expense pertaining to the
repatriation.

Discontinued Operations:

Net
loss from discontinued operations of $1  million in 2006
primarily relates to the previous operating results and loss from the
sale of the U.K. paint decorator tool business in March  2006. In
2005, the Company announced the planned sale of two small businesses:
the U.K. paint decorator tool business and a small appliance hinge
business. The operations of these two held for sale businesses, along
with the resolution of tax and other matters associated with the 2004
divestitures, resulted in a net loss from discontinued operations of
$2  million in 2005. Net earnings from discontinued operations
were $130  million in 2004, reflecting a $95  million net
gain on the March  2004 sale of the residential entry door
business, a $24  million net gain on the December  2004
divestiture of the home décor business, a $4  million net
loss on the sale of a small German paint roller business, as well as
the operating results of these discontinued operations.

Business Segment Results

The
Company’s reportable segments are an aggregation of businesses
that have similar products and services, among other factors. The
Company utilizes operating profit, which is defined as net sales minus
cost of sales, SG&A and allocated corporate and common expenses;
and operating profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the
profitability of each segment. Segment operating profit excludes
interest income, interest expense, other-net, intangible asset
amortization expense, restructuring and asset impairments, and income
tax expense. Refer to Note O Restructuring and Asset Impairments and
Note G Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of restructuring
charges and asset impairments, and intangibles amortization expense,
respectively, attributable to each segment. As discussed previously,
the Company’s operations are classified into three business
segments: Consumer Products, Industrial Tools, and Security
Solutions.

Consumer
Products

:

Net
sales from continuing operations of Consumer Products increased
21% in 2006 compared to 2005. Of this increase, acquisitions,
predominantly National, accounted for 18%, while organic volume
and price rose 2% and 1%, respectively. Foreign currency
did not significantly impact sales. The consumer hand tool business
continued to achieve share gains from the strong performance of the new
FatMax

®

Xtreme

™

and
FatMax

®

XL

™

product lines which
launched in the U.S. and European markets, representing the largest new
hand tools product introduction in the Company’s history. At the
same time, the FatMax

®

range of product offerings
delivered growth though continued premium innovation, distribution
point expansion and related brand support. This favorable performance
was partially offset by lower volumes in the consumer storage and
mechanics tools businesses. The prior year sales


in the consumer storage business reflected
higher volume from the initial launch of garage storage products. The
110  basis point decline in segment operating margin is primarily
due to $8  million of non-cash inventory step-up amortization
from acquisitions, the dilutive impact of National margins due to its
legacy high-cost manufacturing structure which the Company continues to
transition to low cost countries, increased brand support, and
commodity cost inflation, partially offset by savings derived from
price recovery initiatives and prior cost reduction actions.

Consumer Products’ net sales from continuing
operations in 2005 represented a 5% increase over 2004. Of this
5% increase, the November  2005 National acquisition
contributed 1% while organic volume increased 3% driven
by strength in the hand tools and consumer storage business associated
with successful new product introductions. The effects of currency and
pricing contributed equally to the remaining 1% increase. Solid
organic sales growth was achieved despite an unanticipated inventory
correction by certain large North American customers in December
2005 which negatively impacted sales by approximately $30
million versus normal levels. Operating margin improved 50 basis points
primarily due to leverage associated with the increase in sales
volume.

Industrial
Tools:

Industrial
Tools’ net sales increased 32% in 2006 compared to 2005,
primarily driven by the Facom and Besco acquisitions, which increased
sales by $452  million or 33%. Favorable pricing actions
and favorable foreign currency collectively contributed 1%, and
were more than offset by a core volume decline of 2%. The
majority of this decrease was due to fastening systems organic sales
declining 7% compared to the prior year stemming from weakness
in the U.S. construction market and management’s commitment to
turn down unprofitable business. This decline more than offset strong
results in the Mac Tools, Facom, hydraulic tools, industrial tools and
storage businesses, as organic sales aside from fastening systems
increased 3% in 2006 compared to the prior year. Mac
Tools’ continues to benefit from improved retention of its
distributors based on management actions initiated early in the year.
Industrial tools and storage and the hydraulic tools businesses
obtained share gains from the success of new product introductions in
the oil and mining industries as demand for such commodities remained
strong during 2006. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales
decreased by 110 basis points due to $13  million of non-cash
inventory step-up amortization associated with the Facom acquisition,
commodity inflation, supply chain inefficiencies in certain businesses
due to increased backlog, and the sales volume decline and cost
inefficiencies experienced by the U.S. fastening systems business,
partially offset by the accretive impact of Facom. Management is
committed to restoring the fastening systems business’ long-term
cost competitiveness by continuing the migration of production to Asia,
reducing the overall SG&A and manufacturing footprint, as well as
SKU rationalization. Additionally, the acquisition of Asian-based Besco
and the opening of a new manufacturing facility in China during 2006
will strategically aid the fastening systems business’ long term
vitality.

Industrial Tools’ net sales increased
6% in 2005 from 2004. The carryover effect from the 2004
CST/Berger and related 2005 acquisitions contributed nearly 1%
of the sales increase. The 5% organic sales increase was
comprised of 3% volume and 2% price. Sales volume rose on
continued strong demand in the industrial mechanics tools, hydraulic
tools, laser leveling tools, and storage businesses, and to a lesser
extent fastening systems. These volume gains were partially offset by
declines in the Mac Tools and assembly technologies businesses.
Industrial mechanics tools’ increase in volume was driven by
share gains achieved from new product introductions and improved
customer service. Hydraulic tools also benefited from new product
introductions as well as higher product demand associated with the
steel scrap market which was driven by the strong global demand for
steel. Laser leveling tools continued to increase its market share in
the U.S. and European professional markets due to new product
offerings. Although demand began to slow during the latter half of
2005, fastening systems achieved moderate sales growth during 2005
based on demand from the U.S. construction and


industrial channels along with the success
of innovative nail products. The storage business increase in volume
was driven by the successful launch of a vertical lift module automated
storage and retrieval system as well as strong demand experienced in
the industrial, heavy truck, and automotive dealership markets.
Assembly technologies was affected by weakness in the U.S. auto
industry, as the ‘‘Big 3’’ automakers
continued to reduce capital expenditures in conjunction with other cost
reduction initiatives. Mac Tools sales fell due to a decline in the
number of distributors in 2005 compared to 2004 as dealer attrition
outpaced recruiting efforts. However, the average sales per Mac
Tools’ distributor was up 4% versus 2004 and operating
margin improved slightly. Operating profit in 2005 was $136
million, or 9.9% of net sales, up slightly compared to
$133  million, or 10.3% of net sales, in 2004. The 40
basis point decline in the operating margin rate, despite the sales
volume increase, was primarily due to increased freight costs, as well
as unfavorable mix and cost absorption in the fastening business where
manufacturing volume was lower in 2005 compared to 2004 on improved
inventory management.

Security
Solutions:

During
2006, Security Solutions’ sales increased 8%.
Acquisitions contributed 4%, organic sales volume 2%,
pricing 1%, and currency 1%. The automatic doors business
continued to grow its service revenue and achieved strong national
account share gains driven by the favorable impact of new product
introductions, new store openings and increased modernization of
pre-existing stores. The mechanical access business benefited from new
product introductions and its expanded ability to provide customers
with virtually all of their varied mechanical product needs. In
addition, the Security segment as a whole benefited from the growth and
continued integration of its national service foot print. The 2006
operating margin as a percentage of net sales was consistent with 2005
as the favorable impact from prior cost reduction and integration
actions were negated by commodity cost inflation and the dilutive
impact of recently acquired companies until integration initiatives
unfold.

Security Solutions’ sales increased
24% in 2005. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales increased
2%. Sales volume and favorable foreign currency each represented
1% of the organic increase. The increase in organic volume was
driven by the North American mechanical access and electronic security
integration businesses, partially offset by declines in the North
American automatic door and Blick U.K. security businesses. The strong
sales volume achieved by the mechanical access business was driven by
increased demand from its national accounts based on the continued
ability to provide a diversified product offering to such customers,
while the North American security integration business benefited from
strong market conditions. The decline in Blick was attributable to
overall softness in the U.K. economy, while the automatic doors
business was negatively impacted by the non-recurrence of a major
project upgrade at a large customer as compared with 2004. Acquisitions
contributed $17  million of operating profit. The operating
margin rate decrease is primarily attributed to unfavorable mix as a
result of a higher proportion of electronic access sales as compared to
mechanical access, as well as the impact of recent acquisitions as
integration synergies were not yet fully achieved, and there was
unfavorable impact from non-recurring inventory step-up costs in
purchase accounting. However, the second half 2005 operating margin was
15.8% compared to 14.4% in the first half, reflecting the
benefit of various cost reduction initiatives including headcount
reductions at several of the businesses, progress in the integration of
field service organizations and back office systems, and the continued
roll-out of the Stanley Fulfillment System to recently acquired
businesses.


RESTRUCTURING
ACTIVITIES

At December  30,  2006, the
restructuring and asset impairment reserve balance was $63.1
million, which the Company expects to be fully expended by the end of
2007. Restructuring charges in 2007 are expected to increase to
approximately $.20 per diluted share. A summary of the Company’s
restructuring reserve activity from December  31,  2005 to
December  30,  2006 is as follows (in
millions):

Actions:

During 2006, the Company initiated a cost reduction
initiative in order to maintain its cost competitiveness and vitality.
Severance charges of $11.9  million were recorded during the year
relating to a reduction of 728 employees. Approximately $3.0
million of this charge pertained to the Consumer Products segment;
$4.5  million to the Industrial Tools segment; and $4.4
million to the Security Solutions segment. Of these amounts,
$9.3  million has been utilized to date, with $2.6  million
of reserves remaining as of December  30,  2006. In
addition to severance, $4.1  million for a U.K. pension plan
curtailment was recorded in Other, net and $1.3  million of
related consulting costs were recorded in
SG&A.

Pre-2006 Actions:

During 2005, the
Company initiated a $5.7  million cost reduction in various
businesses, of which $4.6  million was recorded in 2005 and
$1.1  million was recorded during 2006. The action was comprised
of the severance of 170 employees and the exit of a leased facility. Of
this amount, $5.0  million has been utilized to date with
$0.7  million of accrual remaining as of December
30,  2006. Approximately $4.3  million of this charge
pertained to the Security Solutions segment; $0.9  million to the
Industrial Tools segment; and $0.5  million to the Consumer
Products segment. In addition, as of December  30,  2006,
$1.2  million of reserves remain relating to pre-2005
actions.

Acquisition Related:

During 2006, the
Company completed a consultation process with its European Works
Council regarding the reorganization of its Facom and Stanley hand
tools activities in Europe (these
‘‘Initiatives’’). These Initiatives will,
among other things, implement growth strategies and reduce costs by
rationalizing manufacturing, logistics, sales and support organizations
resulting in the severance of approximately 580 employees, the closure
of two legacy Facom factories in France, as well as four legacy Facom
distribution centers located in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany
and Switzerland. The facility rationalization
commenced recently with the severance of approximately
440 employees, closure of the two French factories and
exit from the United Kingdom distribution center. The Company
expects to complete these Initiatives during 2007. Cash
expenditures to be incurred for these Initiatives are estimated at
approximately $75  million, of which $59.4  million has
been recorded to the Facom purchase price allocation and
$0.7  million was reported as a 2006 restructuring
charge. As of December  30,  2006, $6.6  million has
been utilized to date, with $53.5  million accrual
remaining. Also, $1.4  million of asset impairments were
recorded to Cost of Sales relating to inventory rationalization
associated with the plant shut downs.

In connection with
its acquisition of National, the Company recorded $8.0  million
in severance costs for 243 employees and $0.3  million for
facility closure costs to the purchase price allocation, and
$0.2  million was recorded as a restructuring charge. As of
December  30,  2006, $5.8  million has been utilized
with $2.7  million accrual remaining.


FINANCIAL
CONDITION

Liquidity, Sources and Uses of
Capital:

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity
are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under various
credit facilities.

Operating and Investing
Activities:

The Company has historically generated strong cash
flows from operations. In 2006, cash flow from operations was
$439  million compared to $362  million in 2005. The
$77  million improvement in 2006 versus 2005 is mainly
attributable to higher cash earnings on the strength of acquisitions,
reflecting the removal of increased non-cash expenses in 2006
(particularly inventory step-up amortization associated with
acquisitions, intangible asset amortization expense and stock-based
compensation expense). Receivables, inventories and accounts payables
generated $11  million higher cash inflows in 2006 compared with
2005 due to increased receivable sales. These favorable impacts were
partially offset by cash outflows for restructuring activities which
amounted to $29  million in 2006, an increase of $20
million over 2005. In 2005, operating cash flow totaled $362
million, down slightly from 2004.

Capital expenditures
were $80  million in 2006, $68  million in 2005, and
$55  million in 2004. The higher capital expenditures in 2006
were driven by upgrades of information systems, the incremental impact
of normal capital spending incurred by recent acquisitions, and
equipment purchases related to new product introductions. The increase
in 2005 capital expenditures versus 2004 was due to new product
introductions, information system upgrades and plant investments in
China and Thailand. The Company expects future capital expenditures to
increase approximately in proportion to its sales
growth.

Free cash flow, as defined in the following table,
was $359  million in 2006 and $294  million in 2005,
considerably exceeding net earnings from continuing operations in a
period of continued strong sales volume growth. The Company believes
free cash flow is an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as
its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to
shareowners.

Based
on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from operations as
well as its strong balance sheet and credit position at December
30,  2006, the Company believes it has the financial flexibility
to deploy capital to its shareholders’ advantage through a
combination of acquisitions, dividends, debt repayment, and potential
future share repurchases.

In 2006, acquisition spending
totaled $572  million, primarily related to Facom and Besco, and
$20  million of debt repayments associated with the 2004
acquisition of Blick. 2005 acquisition spending amounted to $287
million principally for the National, Security Group, Sielox and
Precision acquisitions discussed previously. As part of its portfolio
diversification shift, in 2004 the Company received $205  million
in net proceeds from sales of the residential entry door and home
décor businesses, and disbursed $301  million for business
acquisitions. In 2005, the $21  million of remaining taxes due on
the gain from these business sales were paid. Pursuant to its
profitable growth strategy, the Company will continue to assess its
current business portfolio for disposition opportunities and make
acquisitions in favored markets while minimizing the risk associated
with large customer concentrations. The Company likely will complete
additional 2007 acquisitions requiring funding of approximately $50
– $75  million, aside from HSM which was acquired for
$545  million in January  2007.

During 2006,
the Company entered into a sale-leaseback transaction of its corporate
headquarters building. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company
received $23  million in cash proceeds, reported in investing
cash flows, and recorded a deferred gain of $11  million which
will be amortized over the 15 year operating lease term. The cash
proceeds were utilized to pay down short-term
borrowings.


Financing
Activities:

The Company financed the HSM acquisition with
proceeds from existing short term credit facilities and a new
$500  million 364-day bridge facility entered into on
January  8,  2007. The Company remains committed to its
current credit ratings and intends to refinance this transaction with a
combination of available cash, debt and equity-linked securities, which
it believes will be consistent with maintaining those ratings.
Management does not anticipate the need to issue common equity in the
short term in order to achieve this objective. However, the above
refinancing is expected to entail the issuance of common stock in the
medium term.

Payments on long-term debt amounted to
$4  million in 2006, $72  million in 2005 and $154
million in 2004. Payments in 2004 reflect the maturity of $120
million of debt on March  1,  2004. Net repayments of
short-term borrowings in 2006 amounted to a cash outflow of $66
million as the Company paid down commercial paper utilizing a portion
of the strong operating cash flows. Net short-term borrowings
provided cash inflows of $103 million in 2005 and $20
million in 2004. The increase in 2005 was primarily attributed to
commercial paper issued to fund the 2005 acquisitions aside from
National.

In November  2005, the Company
consummated a Section 144A offering, with registration rights, of
$450  million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities
(‘‘ETPS’’) through its unconsolidated trust
subsidiary, The Stanley Works Capital Trust I (‘‘the
Trust’’). Contemporaneously, the Company borrowed the
proceeds of the ETPS offering from the Trust by issuing $450
million of junior subordinated debt securities payable to the Trust.
The net proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisitions of
National and Facom which closed on November  30,  2005 and
January  1,  2006, respectively. These securities and
underlying junior subordinated debt securities (collectively, the
‘‘securities’’) feature a 5 year fixed rate
period ending December  1,  2010 and a floating rate period
ending December  1,  2045. The fixed coupon was set at
5.902%. The obligations, tenor and terms of the ETPS mirror
those of the junior subordinated debt securities. The securities can be
redeemed by the Company on or after December  1,  2010
without penalty for early payment.

In 2005, the Company
amended its long-term (multi-year) $400  million committed credit
facility by increasing the facility size to $550  million and
adding a multi currency sub-limit of $250  million available in
Euros or Pound Sterling. This long-term credit facility matures in
October  2009. In addition, the Company has short-term lines of
credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating $251  million, of
which $191  million was available at December  30,
2006. Short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal.
Aggregate credit lines amounted to $801  million. The $550
million committed credit facility is designated as a liquidity
back-stop for the Company’s commercial paper program. As of
December  30,  2006 there were no outstanding loans under
this facility and the Company had $31  million of commercial
paper outstanding. In addition to these lines of credit, the Company
maintains a committed facility designed for the securitization of
certain trade accounts receivable for purposes of additional liquidity.
As of December  30,  2006, the Company’s maximum
available funds under this arrangement were $87  million, of
which $60  million was utilized.

In 2003, the
Company filed a Shelf Registration in the amount of $900
million. At December  30,  2006, the Shelf Registration was
unutilized. This filing represents a prospectus which, if accompanied
by a prospectus supplement, would allow the Company to offer, issue and
sell, together or separately, debt, equity and other
securities.

The Company increased its cash dividend per
common share to $1.18 in 2006. Dividends per common share increased
3.5% in 2006, 5.5% in 2005 and 4.9% in
2004.

In 2006, the Company completed a stock repurchase
program whereby it repurchased 4  million outstanding shares of
its common stock for $200  million. The Company will continue to
assess the possibility of repurchasing more of its outstanding common
stock, based on a number of factors including the level of acquisition
activity, the market price of the Company’s common stock and the
current financial condition of the Company.

The
Company’s debt to capital ratio was 39% at the end of
2006, 42% at the end of 2005 and 32% at the end of 2004.
Reflecting the credit protection measures that are incorporated into
the terms of the $450  million ETPS, the debt to capital ratio of
the Company is more fairly represented by apportioning 50% of
the ETPS issuance to equity when making the calculation. The resulting
debt to


capital ratio from this apportionment is
30% as of December  30,  2006. This adjustment is
consistent with the treatment accorded these securities by the
nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations that rate the
Company’s debt securities.

Contractual
Obligations

:

The following summarizes the
Company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments
that impact its liquidity:

Payments Due by
Period

(a)

The
Company anticipates that funding of its pension and postretirement
benefit plans in 2007 will approximate $17  million. That amount
principally represents contributions either required by regulations or
laws or, with respect to unfunded plans, necessary to fund current
benefits. The Company has not presented estimated pension and
postretirement funding in the table above beyond 2007 as funding can
vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair
value of the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, or
curtailment/settlement actions.

Aside from debt
payments, for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment
of principal, payment of the above contractual obligations will
typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow
will be lower than the gross amounts indicated.

Other Commercial
Commitments

Amounts of Commitments Expiration Per
Period

Short-term
borrowings, long-term debt and lines of credit are explained in detail
within Note I Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases and other
commercial commitments are further detailed in Note R Commitments and
Guarantees of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

MARKET RISK

Market risk is the
potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the
fair value of financial instruments, currencies, commodities and other
items traded in global markets. The Company is exposed to market risk
from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock
prices, and commodity prices. Exposure to foreign currency risk results
because the Company, through its global businesses, enters into
transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies.
The Company’s predominant exposures are in European, Canadian
and Asian currencies, including the Chinese Renminbi
(‘‘RMB’’) and the Taiwan Dollar. Certain
cross-currency trade flows arising from sales and procurement
activities as well as affiliate cross-border activity are consolidated
and netted prior to obtaining risk protection, primarily purchased
basket options. The Company is thus able to capitalize on its global
positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and
portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing protection. At
times, the Company also enters


into forward exchange contracts and
purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of
non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables,
predominately for affiliate transactions. Gains and losses from these
hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net
exposures, assets and liabilities being hedged. Management determines
the nature and extent of currency hedging activities, and in certain
cases, may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain
unhedged. The Company has also entered into several cross-currency
interest rate swaps, to provide a partial hedge of the net investments
in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations
to debt service requirements. Sensitivity to foreign currency exposure
risk from these financial instruments at the end of 2006 would have
been immaterial based on the potential loss in fair value from a
hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all currencies. The Company
follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial
instrument transactions, and does not use such instruments for
speculative purposes.

On July  21,  2005,
China announced it will allow the RMB to fluctuate within a very tight
band (+/−  .3% around the weighted average prior day
close) thereby effectively adopting a managed float and ending its
decade-old valuation de facto peg to the U.S. Dollar
(‘‘USD’’). The initial appreciation
was 2%. Besides the initial move, the effect of that policy
shift during 2006 was negligible as total appreciation of the RMB
versus the USD at year end amounted to only 3%. The
Company sources significant products from China and other Asian low
cost countries for resale in other regions. To the extent the
RMB or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the USD, the
Company may experience cost increases on such purchases. While
the present 3% appreciation of the RMB should not generate
material cost increases for RMB denominated purchases, further
appreciation of this or other currencies utilized for procurement could
adversely affect profitability. In the event significant RMB or other
currency appreciation occurs, the Company would initiate customer
pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost
increases, but it is possible such actions would not fully offset the
potential unfavorable impact.

The Company’s
exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt
obligations, short-term investments, and derivative financial
instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio. The debt
portfolio is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce
the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and
floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps, and cross-currency
swaps. The Company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk
comes from its floating rate debt in the U.S. and Europe and is fairly
represented by changes in LIBOR and EURIBOR rates. At December
30,  2006, the result of a hypothetical two percentage point
increase in short-term LIBOR and EURIBOR rates would not have resulted
in a material impact on the pre-tax profit of the
Company.

The Company has exposure to commodity prices in
many businesses, particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper,
zinc, steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods.
Generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative
financial instruments, but instead are actively managed through
customer pricing actions, procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives
and other productivity improvement projects. In 2005, the Company
experienced approximately $40  million of commodity and energy
inflation, most of which was recovered through favorable pricing
actions. Such inflation increased costs by approximately
$45  million in 2006, which management mitigated through various
customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives. If
commodity prices fluctuated to reach new historical high levels,
similar to those experienced in 2004, the Company’s exposure
could increase from the expected levels for 2007 as previously
discussed.

Fluctuations in the fair value of the
Company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense
as discussed in the ESOP section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis.

The assets held by the Company’s defined
benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of
securities, primarily global stocks and fixed-income securities. The
funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of
adverse changes in the plan asset values. The Company employs a
conservative asset allocation as well as investment consultants to
mitigate this risk. Management has worked to minimize this exposure by
freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where
appropriate.


Sales to The Home Depot amounted
to 10% of 2006 consolidated net sales from continuing
operations. The Company has other significant customers, particularly
home centers and major retailers, though individually there are none
that exceed 10% of consolidated sales. The loss or material
reduction of business from any such significant customer could have a
material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations
and cash flows, until either such customers were replaced or the
Company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of
business.

The Company has access to financial resources
and borrowing capabilities around the world. There are no material
instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment
requirements due to a change in credit rating. The Company has the
flexibility to elect deferral of interest payments on its ETPS
obligation for up to 5 years. The Company believes that its strong
financial position, operating cash flows, committed long-term credit
facilities and borrowing capacity, and ready access to equity markets
provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of
annual dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its
businesses, to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other
initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy.

OTHER
MATTERS

ENVIRONMENTAL

The Company incurs
costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and
regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of
previously contaminated sites. Future laws and regulations are expected
to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the
Company’s expenditures related to routine environmental
matters.

The Company accrues for anticipated costs
associated with investigatory and remediation efforts in accordance
with appropriate accounting guidelines which address probability and
the ability to reasonably estimate future costs. The liabilities are
reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation
efforts and their costs can be better estimated. Subject to the
imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company
believes that any sum it may pay in connection with environmental
matters in excess of the amounts recorded will not have a materially
adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or
liquidity. Refer to Note S Contingencies of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
environmental liabilities and related cash
flows.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

As
detailed in Note M Employee Benefit Plans of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (‘‘ESOP’’) under which the
ongoing U.S. defined contribution and 401(K) plans are funded. Overall
ESOP expense is affected by the market value of Stanley stock on the
monthly dates when shares are released, among other factors. Net ESOP
expense amounted to $2  million in each of the years 2006, 2005
and 2004. While the average market value of shares released increased
from $43.20 in 2004 to $49.28 in 2006, other elements of ESOP expense,
including a gradual reduction in the number of shares released annually
from the trust, offset the favorable impact of the higher share
price.  ESOP expense could increase in the future if the market
value of the Company’s common stock
declines.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Refer to
Note A Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements
and the potential impact to the Company’s consolidated results
of operations and financial position.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Preparation of the Company’s
consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Significant accounting policies
used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are
described in Note A Significant Accounting Policies. Management
believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their
significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily
from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with
inherent uncertainty. The most significant areas involving management
estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could
differ from management’s estimates.

ALLOWANCE FOR
DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS    The Company’s estimate for its
allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based
on two methods. The amounts calculated from


each of these methods are combined to
determine the total amount reserved. First, the Company evaluates
specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an
inability to meet financial obligations, such as bankruptcy. In these
cases, the Company uses its judgment, based on the best available facts
and circumstances, to record a specific reserve for those customers
against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to
be collected. These specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as
additional information is received. Second, a reserve is established
for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to
receivables aging categories. These percentages are based on historical
collection and write-off experience.

If circumstances
change, for example, the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or
a material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet
its financial obligation to the Company, estimates of the
recoverability of receivable amounts due could be
reduced.

INVENTORIES — LOWER OF COST OR MARKET,
SLOW MOVING AND OBSOLETE    U.S. inventories are predominantly valued
at the lower of LIFO cost or market. The calculation of LIFO reserves,
and therefore the net inventory valuation, is affected by inflation and
deflation in inventory components. The Company ensures all inventory is
valued at the lower of cost or market, and continually reviews the
carrying value of discontinued product lines and stock-keeping-units
(‘‘SKUs’’) to determine that these items
are properly valued. The Company also continually evaluates the
composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete and/or slow-moving
inventories. Inventory items identified as obsolete and/or slow-moving
are evaluated to determine if reserves are required. The Company
identifies these inventories and assesses the ability to dispose of
them at a price greater than cost. If it is determined that cost is
less than market value, cost is used for inventory valuation. If market
value is less than cost, the Company writes down the related inventory
to that value. If a write down to the current market value is
necessary, the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable
value, or ceiling (defined as selling price less costs to sell and
dispose), and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a
normal profit margin, also called the floor. If the Company is not able
to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory
at its current value, reserves would have to be adjusted
accordingly.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS    The
Company completed acquisitions in 2006 and 2005 valued at $552
million and $289  million, respectively. The assets and
liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair values at
the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair
values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses.
The Company reported $1.1  billion of goodwill and $298
million of indefinite-lived trade names at December  30,
2006.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill and
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized,
but are subject to annual impairment testing. The identification and
measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangible asset impairment
involves the estimation of fair value. The valuation of goodwill also
requires the identification and valuation of reporting units. The
estimates of fair value of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets
and related reporting units are based on the best information available
at the date of assessment, which primarily incorporate management
assumptions about future cash flows. Future cash flows can be affected
by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to
which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly
acquired entities. While the Company has not recorded goodwill or other
intangible asset impairment losses in many years, it is possible
impairments may occur in the future in the event expected
profitability, cash flows or trade name usage change significantly from
current estimates.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND
EQUIPMENT    The Company generally values Property, Plant and
Equipment (‘‘PP&E’’) at historical cost
less accumulated depreciation. Impairment losses are recorded when
indicators of impairment, such as plant closures, are present and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are
less than the carrying amount. The impairment loss is quantified by
comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average
discounted cash flows, which consider various possible outcomes for the
disposition of the assets (i.e. sale, leasing, etc.). Primarily as a
result of plant rationalization, certain facilities and equipment are
not currently used in operations. The Company has previously recorded
impairment losses related to unused and under-utilized assets, and such
losses may occur in the future.


RISK INSURANCE    To some
extent, the Company self insures for various business exposures. For
domestic workers’ compensation and product liability, the
Company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe
losses (‘‘stop loss’’ insurance). The two
risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are
workers’ compensation and product liability (liability for
alleged injuries associated with the Company’s products).
Actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form
the basis for workers’ compensation and product liability loss
reserves recorded. The actuary contemplates the Company’s
specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends
among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves
required. Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves
for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development
of these claims, as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims.
The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by
third party administrator specialists (insurance companies) for
workers’ compensation and by in-house legal counsel in
consultation with outside attorneys for product liability. The cash
outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over
approximately 8 to 10 years, and the present value of expected future
claim payments is reserved. The Company believes the liability recorded
for such risk insurance reserves as of December  30,  2006
is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation
process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this
estimate.

WARRANTY    The Company provides product and
service warranties which vary across its businesses. The types of
warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime,
while certain products carry no warranty. Further, the
Company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service
its products in connection with product performance issues. Historical
warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty
obligations recognized. Adjustments are recorded to the warranty
liability as new information becomes available. The Company believes
the liability recorded for expected warranty claims as of
December  30,  2006 is adequate, but due to judgments
inherent in the reserve estimation process, including forecasting
future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as
the estimated age of certain items submitted for claims, the
ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded
warranty liability.

INCOME TAXES    The future tax
benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax loss
carry-forwards is $126  million at December  30,
2006 and $97  million at December  31,  2005. The
Company believes earnings during the periods when the temporary
differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related
future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the
expiration date of tax loss carry-forwards or the projected operating
results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance
is provided. The valuation allowance as of December  30,
2006 amounted to $27  million.

In assessing the
need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable
income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies
and the realizability of tax loss carry-forwards. Valuation allowances
related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws,
changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the
event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to
realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the
unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which
that determination is made. By contrast, if the Company were to
determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the
future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the
recorded valuation allowance through a favorable earnings adjustment in
the period in which that determination is made. The Company
periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax
years still under audit based on the most current available
information. When it is deemed probable that an adjustment will be
asserted, the Company accrues its best estimate of the tax liability,
inclusive of related interest charges. See Note Q Income Taxes of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS

The Company’s off-balance sheet
arrangements include the following:

RECEIVABLE
SECURITIZATIONS    The Company has agreements to sell, on a
revolving basis, pools of accounts and notes receivables to a Qualified
Special Purpose Entity (‘‘QSPE’’), which


qualifies to be accounted for as an
unconsolidated subsidiary. The entity is designed to facilitate the
securitization of certain trade accounts receivable. Assets and related
debt off-balance sheet were both $60  million at December
30,  2006, compared to $16  million as of December
31,  2005. The Company is responsible for servicing these
accounts while the QSPE bears the risk of non-collection. Sales of
eligible receivables in 2006 amounted to $44  million compared to
$5  million in the prior year. There were no gains or losses on
these sales.

SYNTHETIC LEASES    The Company is a
party to synthetic leasing programs for two of its major distribution
centers and certain personal property, predominately vehicles and
equipment. The programs qualify as operating leases for accounting
purposes, such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the
Statement of Operations and the liability and value of the underlying
assets are off-balance sheet. These lease programs are utilized
primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility. As of
December  30,  2006, the estimated fair value of assets and
remaining obligations for these properties were $95  million and
$72  million, respectively.

TRUST    The Company
owns 100% of the common stock ($0.1  million) of The
Stanley Works Capital Trust I (‘‘the
Trust’’) which was formed in 2005 to initiate the
offering of the $450  million Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities
(‘‘ETPS’’). However, in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R,
‘‘Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
interpretation of ARB No. 51’’ (‘‘FIN
46R’’), the Trust is not consolidated. Since the $450
million of junior subordinated debt issued by the Company to the Trust
is reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December  30,  2006, consolidation of the Trust would have
virtually no impact to the Company’s results of operations or
financial position.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

The management of The Stanley Works is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management
has assessed the effectiveness of The Stanley Works’ internal
control over financial reporting as of December  30,  2006.
In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
(‘‘COSO’’) of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Management concluded
that based on its assessment, The Stanley Works’ internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December
30,  2006. Management’s assessment of and conclusion on
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not
include the internal controls of Facom S.A. and Besco Pneumatic
Corporation, companies acquired in January and July of 2006,
respectively, which are included in the 2006 consolidated financial
statements of The Stanley Works and constituted total assets of
approximately $915  million at December  30,  2006
and approximately $480  million of revenues for the year then
ended. Ernst & Young LLP, the auditor of the financial statements
included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on
management’s assessment of internal controls, a copy of which
appears on page 44.

There has been no change in The
Stanley Works’ internal control over financial reporting during
the fiscal quarter ended December  30,  2006 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, The
Stanley Works’ internal control over financial
reporting.

Within the 90-day period prior to the filing of
this report, under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the
Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company
(including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in
its periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings. There have
been no significant changes in the Company’s internal controls
or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
subsequent to the date of their evaluation.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN
INFORMATION

Compensation plans under which the
Company’s equity securities are authorized for issuance at
December  30,  2006
follow:

(a)

There
is a non-qualified deferred tax savings plan for highly compensated
salaried employees which mirrors the qualified plan provisions, but was
not specifically approved by security holders. U.S. employees are
eligible to contribute from 1% to 15% of their salary to
a tax deferred savings plan as described in the Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (‘‘ESOP’’) section of Item 8
Note M Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements
of this Form 10-K. The Company contributes an amount equal to one-half
of the employee contribution up to the first 7% of their salary,
of which fifty-percent is invested in common stock of the Company for
qualified employees. The investment of the remaining fifty-percent is
controlled by the employee participating in the plan. The same matching
arrangement is provided for highly compensated salaried employees in
the ‘‘non-qualified’’ plan, except that the
arrangement for these employees is outside of the ESOP, and is not
funded in advance of distributions. Shares of the Company’s
common stock may be issued at the time of a distribution from the plan.
The number of securities remaining available for issuance under the
plan at December  30,  2006 is not determinable, since the
plan does not authorize a maximum number of
securities.

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The
management of The Stanley Works is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of
The Stanley Works’ internal control over financial reporting as
of December  30,  2006. In making its assessment,
management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations (‘‘COSO’’) of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework.
Management concluded that based on its assessment, The Stanley
Works’ internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December  30,  2006. Management’s assessment
of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Facom S.A.
and Besco Pneumatic Corporation, companies acquired in January and July
of 2006, respectively, which are included in the 2006 consolidated
financial statements of The Stanley Works and constituted total assets
of approximately $915  million at December  30,  2006
and approximately $480  million of revenues for the year then
ended. Ernst & Young LLP, the auditor of the financial statements
included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on
management’s assessment of internal controls, a copy of which
appears on page 44.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareowners of
The Stanley Works

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of The Stanley Works and subsidiaries as of
December  30,  2006 and December  31,  2005,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
shareowners’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended December  30,  2006. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of The Stanley Works and
subsidiaries at December  30,  2006 and December
31,  2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
December  30,  2006, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of The Stanley
Works’ internal control over financial reporting as of
December  30,  2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated February  20,  2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

As discussed in Note A to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2006 the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (‘‘SFAS’’)
No. 123(Revised 2004), ‘‘Share-Based
Payment’’ and SFAS No. 158,
‘‘Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-An amendment to FASB Statement
Nos. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).’’

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and
Shareowners of The Stanley Works

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that The Stanley Works maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December  30,  2006, based
on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Stanley Works’
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not
include the internal controls of Facom S.A. and Besco Pneumatic
Corporation, companies acquired in January and July of 2006, which are
included in the 2006 consolidated financial statements of The Stanley
Works and constituted total assets of approximately $915  million
at December  30,  2006 and revenues of approximately
$480  million, respectively, for the year then ended.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that The
Stanley Works maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December  30,  2006 is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
opinion, The Stanley Works maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December  30,  2006 based on the COSO
criteria.


We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Stanley Works
and subsidiaries as of December  30,  2006 and
December  31,  2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareowners’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
December  30,  2006 and our report dated February
20,  2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company
and its majority-owned subsidiaries which require consolidation, after
the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to
December  31. There were 52 weeks in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
2004.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, as well as certain financial statement disclosures. While
management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the
preparation of the financial statements are appropriate, actual results
could differ from these estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
TRANSLATION

For foreign operations with functional currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated
at current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using
weighted-average exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments, as
well as gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions, are
reported in a separate component of shareowners’ equity.
Exchange gains and losses on transactions are included in earnings, and
amounted to net losses/(gains) for 2006, 2005 and 2004 of $3.9
million, $(0.9) million and $4.5  million,
respectively.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

Highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less are
considered cash equivalents.

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES
RECEIVABLE

Trade receivables are stated at gross invoice
amount less discounts, other allowances and provision for uncollectible
accounts.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

The
Company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts using two
methods. First, a specific reserve is established for individual
accounts where information is available that customers may have an
inability to meet financial obligations. Second, a reserve is
determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to
aging categories. These percentages are based on historical collection
and write-off experience. Actual write offs are charged against the
allowance when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful,
generally when payments are more than 120 days past
due.

INVENTORIES

U.S. inventories, aside from
Best, Precision, CST/Berger and certain other small businesses, are
valued at the lower of Last-In, First-Out
(‘‘LIFO’’) cost or market. Other
inventories are generally valued at the lower of First-In, First-Out
(‘‘FIFO’’) cost or
market.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

The
Company generally values property, plant and equipment
(‘‘PP&E’’), including capitalized
software, on the basis of historical cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided using
straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life or the term of the lease. Costs related to
maintenance and repairs which do not prolong the assets useful lives
are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses its long-lived assets
for impairment when indicators that the carrying values may not be
recoverable are present. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment,
the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and
liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are
generated (‘‘asset group’’) and estimates
the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with
and expected to be generated from the use of and eventual disposition
of such asset group. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is
quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the
estimated fair value, which is determined using weighted average
discounted cash flows that consider various possible outcomes for the
disposition of the asset group. Primarily as a result of plant
rationalization, certain facilities and equipment are not currently
used in operations, which has resulted in impairment losses. PP&E
impairment charges, classified in Restructuring and Asset Impairments,
amounted to $3.7  million in 2004 and were zero in both 2006 and
2005.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE
ASSETS

Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values
assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses.
Intangible assets acquired are


recorded at estimated fair value. Goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not
amortized, but are tested for impairment annually during the third
quarter, and at any time when events suggest impairment may have
occurred. To assess goodwill for impairment, the Company determines the
fair value of its reporting units, which are primarily determined using
management’s assumptions about future cash flows based on
long-range strategic plans. This approach incorporates many assumptions
including future growth rates, discount factors and tax rates. In the
event the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value,
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying
amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeded its implied
fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying amounts are
tested for impairment by comparing to current fair market value,
usually determined by what it would cost to lease the asset from third
parties. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their
estimated useful lives. Definite-lived intangible assets are also
evaluated for impairment when appropriate. If the carrying value
exceeds the total undiscounted future cash flows, the asset is written
down to fair value. No goodwill or other intangible asset impairments
were recorded during 2006, 2005 and 2004.

FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Derivative financial instruments are employed to
manage risks, including foreign currency and interest rate exposures,
and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The Company
recognizes all derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap
agreements, foreign currency options, and foreign exchange contracts,
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair
value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or
in Shareowners’ Equity as a component of other comprehensive
income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a
fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Changes in fair values of
derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings
along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged items that
relate to the hedged risk. Gains and losses on derivatives designated
as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in
other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings
to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur. In the event
it becomes probable the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow
hedge relates will not occur, the amount in other comprehensive income
would be recognized in earnings and the derivative terminated. Changes
in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net investment
in foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive income. The
fair value of derivatives involving foreign currencies is determined
using the spot exchange rate at the reporting date. Changes in the fair
value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and any portion of a
hedge that is ineffective, are reported in earnings in
Other-net.

The net interest paid or received on interest
rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains resulting from the
early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and
amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining period
of the debt originally covered by the terminated
swap.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is
recognized when the earnings process is complete and the risks and
rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally
occurs upon shipment of the finished product but sometimes is upon
delivery to customer facilities. Provisions for customer volume
rebates, product returns, discounts and allowances are recorded as a
reduction of revenue in the same period the related sales are
recorded.

Certain Security Solutions segment revenues
include multiple elements of products and services. Revenues from
multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned,
consistent with the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 00-21, ‘‘Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables’’. Amounts allocated to each element are based
on objectively determined fair value. Additionally, revenues related to
the sale and installation of electronic access security systems are
generally recorded on the percentage-of-completion basis. This method
recognizes estimated contractual profits and revenues while projects
are in process based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to
total expected costs. Revenues from multiple element arrangements and
percentage-of-completion contracts were each less than 10% of
consolidated revenues in all years.

ADVERTISING
COSTS

Television advertising is expensed the first time the
advertisement airs, whereas other advertising is expensed as incurred.
Advertising Costs are classified as SG&A expenses


and amounted to $44.4  million in 2006,
$31.3  million in 2005 and $28.3  million in 2004.
Cooperative advertising expense reported as a deduction in net sales
was $26.3  million in 2006, $26.5  million in 2005 and
$21.9  million in 2004.

INCOME
TAXES

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before
income taxes. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are
classified as Income Taxes in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary
differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial
reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes, and
are measured by applying enacted tax rates in effect in years in which
the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is
recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more
likely than not to be realized.

EARNINGS PER
SHARE

Basic earnings per share equals net earnings divided by
weighted average shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
per share include the impact of common stock equivalents using the
treasury stock method when the effect is
dilutive.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

The
Company generally does not bill customers for freight. Shipping and
handling costs associated with inbound freight are reported in cost of
sales. Shipping costs associated with outbound freight are reported as
a reduction of net sales and amounted to $128.4  million,
$99.9  million and $102.3  million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Distribution costs are classified in SG&A expenses
and amounted to $118.2  million, $77.0  million and
$75.8  million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION

Effective January  1,  2006, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004), ‘‘Share-Based Payment’’,
(‘‘SFAS 123R’’), using the modified
prospective method whereby prior periods are not restated for
comparability. SFAS 123R requires recognition of stock-based
compensation expense in the statement of operations over the vesting
period based on the fair value of the award at the grant date.
Previously, the Company used the intrinsic value method under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, ‘‘Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees’’ (‘‘APB
25’’), as amended by related interpretations of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board
(‘‘FASB’’). Under APB 25, no compensation
cost was recognized for stock options because the quoted market price
of the stock at the grant date was equal to the amount per share the
employee had to pay to acquire the stock after fulfilling the vesting
period. SFAS 123R supersedes APB 25 as well as Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, ‘‘Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation’’, which permitted pro forma
footnote disclosures to report the difference between the fair value
method and the intrinsic value method. The Company recognized expense
for restricted share grants under the previous guidance, so the impact
from adopting SFAS 123R pertains to the requirement to expense stock
options (including employee stock purchase plan options).

For share-based grants made in 2005 and earlier years, the
Company used the ‘‘accelerated method’’ of
expense attribution under FASB Interpretation No. 28
(‘‘FIN 28’’). Effective January
1,  2006 with the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company elected to
change its policy to straight-line expense attribution for all grants
made in 2006 and subsequent periods. Refer to Note K, Capital Stock,
for additional information.

NEW ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

In February  2007, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(‘‘SFAS’’) No. 159, ‘‘The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities, Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 115’’,
(‘‘SFAS 159’’). This Statement permits
entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value that are not currently required to be
measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of
fiscal 2008. The Company has not yet assessed the effect, if any, that
adoption of SFAS 159 will have on its results of operations and
financial position.

In September  2006, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 158 ‘‘Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)’’,
(‘‘SFAS 158’’). This statement requires
recognition of the funded status of benefit plans


measured as the difference between plan
assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligations. Related to
this recognition of the funded status in the benefit plan asset or
liability account, SFAS 158 requires reporting as a component of other
comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains and losses and prior
service costs or credits that have not yet been recognized as
components of net periodic benefit cost in earnings. SFAS 158 requires
defined benefit plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the
fiscal year-end date. New disclosures include the expected effects on
net periodic benefit costs for the next fiscal year from amortization
of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and the
transition asset or obligation. The Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS 158 and initially applied them as of December  30,
2006. The initial recognition of the funded status of defined benefit
postretirement plans resulted in a decrease to Shareowners’
Equity of $61.1  million, net of taxes of $26.7  million.
The adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS 158 will have no
impact on the Company because it already measures its benefit plan
obligations as of the fiscal year end. SFAS 158 does not change the
determination of net periodic benefit cost.

In
September  2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
‘‘Fair Value Measurements’’,
(‘‘SFAS 157’’). This  Statement is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November  15,  2007. SFAS 157 provides a common fair
value hierarchy for companies to follow in determining fair value
measurements in the preparation of financial statements and expands
disclosure requirements relating to how such fair value measurements
were developed. SFAS 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should
be based on the assumptions that the marketplace would use when pricing
an asset or liability, rather than company specific data. The Company
is currently assessing the impact that SFAS 157 will have on its
results of operations and financial position.

In
June  2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
(‘‘FIN 48’’), ‘‘Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of SFAS No.
109’’. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. The disclosure provisions will provide more information about
the uncertainty in income tax assets and liabilities. Upon adoption,
the Company will first assess whether it is more likely
than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based
on its technical merits.  If the tax position is more
likely than not to be sustained, under the
presumption the taxing authority has all relevant
information, it will be recognized. The recognized tax
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater
than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold will be
derecognized in the period in which that threshold is no longer
met.  FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December  15, 2006. The Company is currently
assessing the impact the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its results of
operations and financial position.

In March  2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, ‘‘Accounting for Servicing
of Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement No.
140’’, (‘‘SFAS 156’’). The
provisions of SFAS 156 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
September  15,  2006. This statement was issued to simplify
the accounting for servicing rights and to reduce the volatility that
results from using different measurement attributes. The Company does
not expect the adoption of SFAS 156 to have a material impact on its
results of operations and financial position.

In
February  2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155
‘‘Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140’’,
(‘‘SFAS 155’’). SFAS 155 clarifies certain
issues relating to embedded derivatives and beneficial interests in
securitized financial assets. The provisions of SFAS 155 are effective
for all financial instruments acquired or issued for fiscal years
beginning after September  15,  2006. The Company is
currently assessing the impact that the adoption of SFAS 155 will have
on its results of operations and financial
position.


RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain
prior years’ amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

B. ACCOUNTS AND NOTES
RECEIVABLE

Trade
receivables are dispersed among a large number of retailers,
distributors and industrial accounts in many countries. Adequate
reserves have been established to cover anticipated credit
losses.

The Company has agreements to sell, on a revolving
basis, undivided interests in defined pools of notes receivable to a
Qualified Special Purpose Entity
(‘‘QSPE’’). The entity is designed to
facilitate the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable and
is used as an additional source of liquidity. At December
30,  2006 and December  31,  2005, the defined pools
of receivables amounted to $86.7  million and $125.1
million, respectively, while the agreement permits the QSPE to have a
maximum of $150  million of borrowings outstanding at any time.
The proceeds from sales of such eligible receivables to the QSPE in
revolving-period securitizations were $43.9  million in 2006 and
$4.7  million in 2005. There were no gains or losses on these
sales. The amounts deducted from receivables in the December
30,  2006 and December  31,  2005 Consolidated
Balance Sheets under this arrangement were $60.3  million and
$16.4  million, respectively. The Company is responsible for
servicing and collecting the receivables sold and held in the QSPE. Any
incremental costs related to such servicing and collection efforts are
not significant. The QSPE bears the risk of non-collection on the
receivables it has purchased.

C.
INVENTORY

Net
inventories in the amount of $237.1  million at December
30,  2006 and $219.4  million at December  31,
2005 were valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. If the LIFO
method had not been used, inventories would have been $68.8
million higher than reported at December  30,  2006 and
$65.5  million higher than reported at December  31,
2005. The LIFO method is utilized in determining inventory value as it
results in better matching of cost and revenues.

D. ASSETS HELD
FOR SALE

Assets held for sale are reported at the lower
of fair value less cost to sell or carrying value. At December
30,  2006, $28.2  million of financing lease receivables
were classified as held for sale. These receivables, generated by the
Blick business within the Security Solutions segment, will be sold in
2007 for an amount expected to slightly exceed their aggregate carrying
value.

At December  31,  2005,  real
property in the Consumer Products segment, valued at $0.6
million was classified as held for sale; this property was sold during
2006 and a gain of approximately $1.9 million was recognized thereon.
Also, $1.7  million of assets related to the Goldblatt

®

product line in this same segment were classified as held for sale at
December  31,  2005 and sold during 2006.

Additionally, the net assets of the American appliance hinge
and the U.K. decorator tools businesses, which were sold in 2006, were
classified as held for sale at December  31,  2005, as
detailed in Note T Discontinued Operations.


E. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Depreciation
and amortization expense associated with property, plant and equipment
was as
follows:

The
amounts above are inclusive of discontinued operations depreciation and
amortization expense of $0.1  million in 2006, $0.3
million in 2005 and $3.0  million in 2004.

F.
ACQUISITIONS

The Company completed 20 acquisitions during
2006, 2005 and 2004. These businesses were acquired pursuant to the
Company’s growth and portfolio repositioning strategy. The
acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141
(‘‘SFAS 141’’), ‘‘Business
Combinations’’, and their results are included in the
Company’s consolidated operating results from the respective
acquisition dates. All of the acquisitions have resulted in the
recognition of goodwill. Goodwill reflects the future earnings and cash
flow potential of the acquired business in excess of the fair values
that are assigned to all other identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill arises because the purchase price paid reflects numerous
factors including the strategic fit and expected synergies these
targets bring to existing operations, the competitive nature of the
bidding process and the prevailing market value for comparable
companies. SFAS 141 requires all identifiable assets and liabilities
acquired to be reported at fair value and the excess is recorded as
goodwill. The Company obtains information during due diligence and from
other sources which forms the basis for the initial allocation of
purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities
acquired. In the months following an acquisition, independent
intangible asset valuation reports, asset appraisals and other data are
obtained in order to finalize the fair values assigned to acquired
assets and liabilities.

Integration of certain
acquisitions requires reduction of redundant personnel, closure of
facilities, and other restructuring actions related to the acquired
businesses. In such cases, a restructuring accrual is recorded for
actions identified in integration strategy plans initially developed by
the Company as of the acquisition date, with a resulting increase to
goodwill. As integration strategies are executed, the Company monitors
the previously established restructuring accruals and makes adjustments
to the extent actual expenditures differ from the estimated accruals.
Adjustments recorded to previously established restructuring accruals
until the time integration plans are fully executed, not to exceed one
year from date of original acquisition, are reflected in the final
goodwill amount included in the purchase price allocation. Adjustments
made subsequent to the finalization of integration strategies, or after
one year from the date of original acquisition, are reflected in
earnings if increases to the originally established accruals are
required, while accruals that are not fully utilized are appropriately
reduced against goodwill.


2006 ACQUISITIONS

On
January  1,  2006, the Company completed the acquisition of
Facom S.A. (‘‘Facom’’) for 407
million euros ($479.8  million) which was financed with a
combination of cash on hand and debt issuance. Facom, based in France,
is a leading European manufacturer of hand and mechanics tools with
annual revenues approximating $475  million. Facom designs,
manufactures and markets the majority of its tool product range to
professional automotive and industrial end users with its well-known
industrial tool brands: Facom

®

,
Virax

®

and USAG

®

. Facom operates
primarily within the premium industrial and automotive tools sector in
Europe, while the Company’s pre-existing European customer base
is focused mainly on the construction and D-I-Y
(‘‘do-it-yourself’’) channels. Facom is
primarily included in the Company’s Industrial Tools segment
while its minor D-I-Y business is included in the Consumer Products
segment.

As of July  31,  2006, the Company
completed a tender offer to acquire approximately 67% of the
outstanding shares of Besco Pneumatic Corporation
(‘‘Besco’’), a leading manufacturer of
pneumatic tools for $37.9  million in cash. Over the next five
years, the Company will have the option to increase its ownership by an
additional 15% to an ultimate ownership of 82%. Besco,
which is headquartered in Taiwan and also has operations in China,
possesses state-of-the-art research and development capabilities and
efficient production facilities. Besco was one of Stanley fastening
systems’ largest suppliers and approximately half of its 2005
sales of $38  million were to the Company. The acquisition is a
key step in reducing fastening system’s existing cost structure
and will facilitate the pursuit of business in emerging markets aided
by Besco’s brand strength in Asia.

The Company also
made five bolt-on acquisitions and increased its investment in a
previously consolidated joint venture during 2006 for a combined
purchase price of $33.9  million. On January  23,
2006, Automatic Entrances of Colorado, Inc. (‘‘Automatic
Entrances’’) was acquired. This is a distributor that
sells, installs and services automatic doors and gates in several
western states in the U.S. Another automatic door distributor,
Automatic Doors Systems, Inc. (‘‘Automatic Doors), was
acquired on July  31,  2006 and operates in the
southeastern U.S. region. These two acquisitions increased the
geographic scale of the automatic door business’ existing branch
structure. On February  28,  2006, the Company completed
the acquisition of Allan Brothers (Pty) Ltd. and affiliated companies
(‘‘Allan Brothers’’), a South African
producer of various nail and staple products that complements the
Company’s existing fastening systems business. GDX Technologies
Ltd. was acquired on July  26,  2006 and is a leading
access control supplier in the United Kingdom that possesses strong
technological product development capabilities. This business
complements the Company’s existing European security integration
business. Another small bolt-on acquisition was made related to the
Company’s mechanical access business, and an additional
20% interest was acquired in a previously consolidated Chinese
joint-venture.

The total purchase price of $551.6
million (inclusive of $2.4  million of hold-back note payables)
for the 2006 acquisitions reflects transaction costs and is net of cash
acquired. Amounts allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed are based on estimates of fair value. The purchase price
allocation of Besco includes 100% of the acquired assets and
liabilities, of which $22.1  million is a non-controlling
interest that is reflected in Other liabilities in the Consolidate
Balance Sheet.

Adjustments to reflect the fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are complete for Facom,
Automatic Doors, Automatic Entrances, and Allan Brothers. However, the
purchase price allocations for the Besco, GDX and other minor
acquisitions are preliminary, mainly with respect to finalization of
intangible asset valuations, related deferred taxes, and other minor
items.


The following table summarizes the
estimated fair values of major assets acquired and liabilities assumed
for the 2006 acquisitions in the
aggregate:

Other
liabilities primarily consist of liabilities for warranty,
environmental and employee benefit obligations associated with the
Facom acquisition and the previously discussed $22.1 million Besco
non-controlling interest.

The weighted average useful
lives assigned to the amortizable assets identified above are trade
names — 7 years; customer relationships — 13 years;
patents and technology — 15 years; and other intangible assets
— 9 years. The amount allocated to the trade names includes
$171.6  million associated with the Facom acquisition
(Facom

®

, Virax

®

, and
USAG

®

) which have been determined to have indefinite
lives. Goodwill associated with the 2006 acquisitions that is
deductible for tax purposes amounts to $0.6
million.

During 2006, the Company completed a consultation
process with its European Works Council regarding the reorganization of
its Facom and Stanley hand tools activities in Europe (these
‘‘Initiatives’’). These Initiatives will,
among other things, implement growth strategies and reduce costs by
rationalizing manufacturing, logistics, sales and support organizations
resulting in the severance of approximately 580 employees, the closure
of two legacy Facom factories in France, as well as four legacy Facom
distribution centers located in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany
and Switzerland. The facility rationalization
commenced recently with the severance of approximately
440 employees, closure of the two French factories and
exit from the United Kingdom distribution center. The Company
expects to complete these Initiatives during 2007. Cash
expenditures to be incurred for these Initiatives are estimated at
$75  million, of which $59.4  million has been recorded to
the Facom purchase price allocation and $0.7  million
was reported as a 2006 restructuring charge. As of
December  30,  2006, $6.6  million has been utilized
to date, with $53.5  million accrual remaining. Also,
$1.4  million of asset impairments were recorded to Cost of Sales
relating to inventory rationalization associated with the plant shut
downs.

2005 ACQUISITIONS

The Company completed
the acquisition of Security Group, Inc. (‘‘Security
Group’’) on January  4,  2005 and acquired
certain assets and liabilities of Rolatape Corporation
(‘‘Rolatape’’) as of March
11,  2005 for a combined cost of $57.4  million. Security
Group manufactures and distributes locking devices, lock parts and
safes in the United States and Europe. Rolatape, a small-bolt on to the
2004 CST / Berger acquisition, designs, manufactures and distributes
measuring wheels in professional survey, construction and industrial
channels. In January  2005, the Company acquired Eastern Vault
& Security Limited (‘‘EVS’’), a small
distributor of electronic security products and services primarily to
financial institutions in Canada for $1.3  million, which was
immediately integrated into the Frisco Bay business. On May
12,  2005, the Company acquired Sielox Security Systems Pty Ltd
(‘‘Sielox’’) for $6.3  million.
Sielox is an Australian-based security integrator that provides
security systems for new construction environments such as prisons,
major apartment and


office projects, and provides the Company a
footprint in the Australian security markets. Precision Hardware, Inc.
(‘‘Precision’’) was acquired on May
24,  2005 for a purchase price of $41.5  million. Precision
manufactures and distributes exit devices, door closers and security
hardware in the United States and provides a complementary product line
to the Company’s existing mechanical access business. The
Company completed the acquisition of ABZ Verwaltungs, Beteiligungs and
Handels Gmbh along with a remaining 50% interest in Chicago
Steel Tape Gmbh (collectively ‘‘ABZ’’) on
September  6,  2005 for $3.3  million. ABZ, based in
Germany, develops and produces surveying technology and equipment. On
September  30,  2005, Pinnacle Electronic Systems, Inc.
(‘‘Pinnacle’’) was acquired for $5.1
million. Pinnacle is a full-service electronic security integrator
specializing in correctional facilities in the Eastern and Midwestern
United States. On November  30,  2005, the Company
completed the acquisition of National Manufacturing Co.
(‘‘National’’) for $174.3  million.
National is a leading North American manufacturer and supplier of
builders’ hardware that markets the majority of its product
range through the two-step cooperative channel to the builder trade and
serves over 25,000 outlets with manufacturing operations in the U.S.,
Canada and Mexico.

The total purchase price of
$289.2  million for the 2005 acquisitions reflects transaction
costs and is net of cash acquired. Amounts allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed are based on estimates of fair value.
Adjustments to reflect the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are complete for the 2005
acquisitions.

The following table summarizes the estimated
fair values of major assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the
2005 acquisitions in the
aggregate:

The
purchase price allocation above includes a $6.9  million
hold-back note payable that was issued in conjunction with the Security
Group acquisition which was repaid in quarterly installments during
2005.

The weighted average useful lives assigned to the
amortizable assets identified above are trade names —
8 years; customer relationships — 9 years; patents and
technology — 8 years; and other intangible assets — 2
years. The amount allocated to trade names includes $17.9
million, $9.2  million and $0.9  million associated with
the National, Security Group and Rolatape acquisitions, respectively,
which have been determined to have indefinite lives. Goodwill
associated with the 2005 acquisitions that is deductible for tax
purposes totals $25.8  million.

In connection with
its acquisition of National, the Company recorded $8.0  million
in severance costs for 243 employees and $0.3  million for
facility closure costs to the purchase price allocation, and

I.
LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Long-term debt
and financing arrangements at December  30,  2006 and
December  31,  2005
follow:

In
December  2005, the Company amended its committed 5 year
revolving credit agreement, increasing the size from $400
million to $550  million; this includes provisions that allow
designated subsidiaries to borrow up to $250  million in Euros
and Pounds Sterling. The credit agreement maturity is October
2009. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.08% per
annum.

In addition, the Company has short-term lines of
credit with numerous banks aggregating $251.4  million, of which
$190.9  million was available at December  30,  2006.
Short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal. The
aggregate long-term and short-term lines amounted to $801.4
million. The Company’s $550  million committed credit
facility is designated as a liquidity back-stop for its commercial
paper program. The Company increased its commercial paper program from
$400.0  million to $550.0  million in December  2006.
The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings at
December  30,  2006 and December  31,  2005
were 4.7% and 4.2%,
respectively.



In
November  2005, the Company issued $450.1  million of
junior subordinated debt securities to The Stanley Works Capital Trust
I (‘‘Trust’’), with a 40-year term and a
fixed initial coupon rate of 5.902% for the first five years.
The Trust, which is not consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R,
obtained the funds it loaned to the Company through the capital market
sale of $450.0  million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities
(‘‘ETPS’’) and through the sale of
$0.1  million in Trust Common Securities to the Company. The
obligations, tenor and terms of the ETPS mirror those of the junior
subordinated debt securities. The securities may be redeemed after five
years without penalty. If not redeemed after 5 years, the coupon rate
will reset quarterly to 1.4% plus the highest of 3-month LIBOR,
the 10-Year US Treasury CMT or the 30-Year US Treasury CMT, limited to
a maximum rate of 13.25%. Net proceeds of the issuance were used
to partially finance the acquisitions of Facom (January 1, 2006) and
National (November 30, 2005).

To manage interest costs and
to better match financial obligations to sources of operating cash
flows, the Company maintains a portfolio of swap agreements. See Note J
Financial Instruments for more information regarding the
Company’s interest rate and currency swap
agreements.

Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt
for each of the years from 2007 to 2011 are $230.3  million,
$14.6  million, $5.0  million, $6.7  million and
$0.9  million, respectively. Interest paid during 2006, 2005, and
2004 amounted to $70.3  million, $38.9  million, and
$39.0  million, respectively.

Included in Short-term
borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December
30,  2006 and December  31,  2005, is commercial
paper of $31.1  million and $105.7  million,
respectively.

The Company assumed $29  million of
debt in the Blick and Frisco Bay acquisitions. As of December
30,  2006 and December  31,  2005, the remaining
balance of the U.K. loan notes related to the Blick acquisition was
$1.5  million and $20.4  million, respectively, which is
reflected in the current portion of long-term debt.

In
2005, the Company paid $70.6  million to purchase 2.5
million shares of common stock, settling the remaining portion of the
common stock equity hedge forward contracts that were amended in
June  2003. The notional principal balance of $70.6
million as of January  1,  2005 had been recognized as debt
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the 2.5  million
underlying shares were excluded from the number of shares used to
calculate basic and diluted earnings per share. Refer to Note K,
Capital Stock, for further details on the extinguished equity hedge
contracts.

J. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
Company’s objectives in using debt and foreign currency related
financial instruments are to obtain the lowest cost source of funds
within a targeted range of variable to fixed-rate debt proportions, to
better match financial obligations to sources of operating cash flows,
and to minimize the foreign exchange risks arising from cross-border
cash flows. To meet these risk management objectives, the Company
enters into interest rate swap and currency swap agreements, purchased
currency options and foreign exchange contracts. Derivative instruments
are not employed for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recognized
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and hedge accounting
is applied based on the criteria specified in SFAS No. 133,
‘‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities’’, whereby management designates its
derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net
investment hedges.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Purchased
currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to
hedge multi-currency inter-company and trade cash flows expected to
occur over the next one year period. The objective of these instruments
is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating
results. In addition, interest rate swaps are utilized to create a
fixed rate liability, to achieve the targeted mix of fixed versus
floating rate debt.

Forward contracts:

At
December  30,  2006 and December  31,  2005,
forward contracts hedging inter-company transactions totaled
$72.8  million and $84.3  million, respectively. These
foreign exchange forward contracts are denominated in Australian
Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Danish Krone, Euro, Japanese Yen, Great
Britain Pound, New Zealand Dollars, South African Rand, Swiss Franc,



Swedish Krona, Taiwanese Dollars and Thai
Baht. The aggregate fair value of these forward contracts as of
December  30,  2006 is a $0.9  million gain that is
recorded in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

Interest rate swaps:

The Company has
executed interest rate swaps to exchange the floating rate rent
associated with two of its major distribution centers to a fixed rent
amount. At December  30,  2006, the aggregate fair value of
the outstanding interest rate swaps is a net gain of $0.4
million as reflected in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

In November  2005, the Company entered into
interest rate swaps prior to the issuance of its Enhanced Trust
Preferred Security (‘‘ETPS’’) with an
aggregate notional value of $300  million. These swaps were used
to mitigate interest rate volatility relative to the 5 year Treasury
rate by effectively fixing the ETPS 5 year rate. The interest rate
swaps had original maturity dates of November  2010, which
matched the end of the fixed rate ETPS term. As planned, the swaps were
terminated at the time of the ETPS issuance resulting in a pre-tax loss
of $1.3  million, which was reflected in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheet; this loss is
being amortized to interest expense over a period of five
years.

Additionally, in 2005 the Company entered into a
thirty year floating to fixed interest rate swap with a notional value
of $150  million. The swap hedged the interest rate exposure
associated with the forecasted refinancing of the $150  million
3.5% bonds maturing November  2007. During 2006 the swap
was terminated, resulting in a $5.9  million gain before tax. The
termination of this financial instrument is consistent with the
Company’s risk management objective to obtain the lowest cost
source of funds within a targeted range of variable to fixed rate
interest rate proportions. The gain arising from the swap termination
is reflected in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, and will be amortized to future
earnings.

Cross currency swaps:

The Company
and its subsidiaries have entered into various inter-company
transactions whereby the notional values were denominated in currencies
(United States Dollar, Euro and Canadian Dollar) other than the
functional currencies of the party executing the trade (United States
Dollar and Euro). In order to better match the cash flows of its
inter-company obligations with cash flows from operations, the Company
entered into cross currency swaps. The swaps have an aggregate United
States Dollar notional value of $266.3  million and maturity
dates ranging from December  2007 to November  2010. At
December  30,  2006, the aggregate fair value of the
Company’s cross currency swaps that were designated as cash flow
hedges, was a net loss of $38.5  million as reflected in Other
Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For
derivative instruments that are so designated at inception and qualify
as cash flow hedges, the Company records the effective portions of the
gain or loss on the derivative instrument in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss, a separate component of Shareowners’ Equity,
and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period
during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. The
ineffective portion of the gain or loss, if any, is immediately
recognized in the same caption where the hedged items are recognized in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations, generally Other-net. There
is a $4.4  million after-tax gain reported for cash flow hedge
effectiveness in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss as of
December  30,  2006. Any gain or loss on these instruments
at maturity will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged
transactions occur in the years 2007 through 2010. The ultimate amount
recognized will vary based on fluctuations of the hedged currencies
(United States Dollar, Euro, Great Britain Pound and Canadian Dollar)
through the maturity dates. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, $25.7
million, ($12.7) million and $14.3  million pertaining to cash
flow hedges was reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
into earnings during the periods in which the underlying hedged
transactions affected earnings; due to the effectiveness of these
instruments in matching the underlying on a net basis there was no
significant earnings impact.

FAIR VALUE
HEDGES

For derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes the gain or loss
on the derivative instrument in earnings in the same caption where the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item is recognized in the current
period.



Cross currency
swaps:

The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into
various inter-company transactions where the notional values are
denominated in currencies (United States Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro,
Japanese Yen and Great Britain Pound) other than the functional
currencies of the party executing the trade (United States Dollar,
Great Britain Pound and Euro). In order to better match the cash flows
of its inter-company obligations with cash flows from operations, the
Company entered into various cross currency swaps. The swaps have an
aggregate United States Dollar notional value of $350.0  million
with maturity dates ranging from December  2007 to
September  2010. At December  30,  2006 the aggregate
fair value of the Company’s cross currency swaps that were
designated as fair value hedges, was a net loss of $14.3  million
as reflected in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGE

The Company
utilizes net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment
arising from remeasuring its investment in the assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses of its foreign subsidiaries. For derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges,
the Company records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, a
component of Shareowners’ Equity.

In
February  2004, the Company entered into a cross currency swap
with a United States Dollar notional value of $45.4  million to
hedge its net investment in Great Britain Pound assets. The Company
pays Great Britain Pounds and receives United States Dollars using
fixed interest rates, offsetting the translation adjustment of its net
investment in Great Britain Pound assets. This swap has a maturity date
of February  2014. At December  30,  2006, the fair
value of this currency swap was a loss of $5.2  million and is
recorded in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the
pre-tax loss on the net investment hedge included in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss is $5.5  million.

In
February  2006, the Company entered into a cross currency swap
maturing December  2006, with a United States Dollar notional
value of $100  million to hedge its net investment in Euro
assets. The Company pays Euros and receives United States Dollars using
fixed interest rates, offsetting the translation adjustment of its net
investment in Euro assets. At maturity, the derivative contract was
settled and a pre-tax loss of $10.1  million on this initial
contract was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. In
December  2006, the Company entered into another cross currency
swap with a notional value of $100  million and a maturity of
December  2009 to continue to hedge its net investment of Euro
assets. The Company paid Euros and received United States Dollars using
fixed interest rates, offsetting the translation adjustment of its net
investment in Euro assets. At December  30,  2006, the fair
value of this currency swap was a loss of $0.5  million as
reported in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the
loss on the net investment hedge included in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss was $0.5  million before
taxes.

UNDESIGNATED HEDGES

Purchased currency
options and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to reduce
exchange risks arising from cross-border cash flows expected to occur
over the next one year period. The objective of these practices is to
minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating
results.

At December  30,  2006, forward
contracts hedging intercompany transactions totaled $139.2
million. These foreign exchange forward contracts are denominated in
Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Danish Krone, Euro, Japanese Yen,
Great Britain Pound, New Zealand Dollars, Polish Zloty, South African
Rand, Swiss Franc, Swedish Krona, Taiwanese Dollars and Thai Baht. The
contracts mature in less than one year. The aggregate fair value of
these forward contracts is a $0.2  million loss that is recorded
in Other Current Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS

For forward
contracts and cross currency swaps designated as cash flow, fair value
or net investment hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by
comparing the cumulative change in the hedge contract with the
cumulative change in the hedged item, both of which are based on
forward rates. The ineffective portion, if any, of the hedge is
recognized in earnings immediately. Hedge ineffectiveness was
immaterial for 2006, 2005 and 2004.



For interest rate swaps designated
as cash flow hedges, the Company measures the hedging effectiveness by
offsetting the change in the variable portion of the interest rate swap
with the change in the expected interest flows due to fluctuations in
the LIBOR based interest rate.

The counterparties to all
of the above mentioned financial instruments are major international
financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk for net
exchanges under these agreements, but not for the notional amounts. The
risk of default is considered remote.

The carrying values
and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments at
December  30,  2006 and December  31,  2005
follow:

The
fair values of long-term debt instruments are estimated using
discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Company’s marginal
borrowing rates. The fair values of foreign currency and interest rate
swap agreements are based on current settlement values. The carrying
amount of cash equivalents and short-term borrowings approximates fair
value.

COMMON
STOCK SHARE ACTIVITY

Common stock share activity for 2006,
2005 and 2004 was as
follows:



COMMON STOCK
RESERVED

Common stock shares reserved for issuance under
various employee and director stock plans at December  30,
2006 and December  31,  2005 are as
follows:

PREFERRED
STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

Each outstanding share of common stock
has one half of a share purchase right. Each purchase right may be
exercised to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $220.00, subject
to adjustment. The rights, which do not have voting rights, expire on
March  10,  2016, and may be redeemed by the Company at a
price of $0.01 per right at any time prior to the tenth day following
the public announcement that a person has acquired beneficial ownership
of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock. In the
event that the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
combination transaction, provision shall be made so that each holder of
a right (other than a holder who is a 14.9%-or-more shareowner)
shall have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof, that number of
shares of common stock of the surviving Company having a market value
equal to two times the exercise price of the right. Similarly, if
anyone becomes the beneficial owner of more than 15% of the then
outstanding shares of common stock (except pursuant to an offer for all
outstanding shares of common stock which the independent directors have
deemed to be fair and in the best interest of the Company), provision
will be made so that each holder of a right (other than a holder who is
a 14.9%-or-more shareowner) shall thereafter have the right to
receive, upon exercise thereof, common stock (or, in certain
circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company)
having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the
right. At December  30,  2006 there were 40,920,814
outstanding rights. There are 250,000 shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock reserved for issuance in connection with
the rights.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The
Company has stock-based compensation plans for salaried employees and
non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The plans provide for
discretionary grants of stock options, restricted stock units, and
other stock-based awards. The plans are generally administered by the
Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors,
consisting of non-employee directors.

Stock
Options:

Stock options are granted at the market price of the
Company’s stock on the date of grant and have a 10 year term.
Generally, stock option grants vest ratably between one and four years
from the date of grant. The expense for stock options granted to
retirement eligible employees (those aged 55 and over and with 10 or
more years of service) is recognized by the date they became retirement
eligible, or on the date of grant if they are already retirement
eligible, as such employees may retain their options for the 10 year
contractual term in the event they retire prior to the end of the
vesting period stipulated in the grant.

The following
describes how certain assumptions affecting the estimated fair value of
stock options are determined: the dividend yield is computed as the
annualized dividend rate at the date of grant divided by the strike
price of the stock option; expected volatility is based on an average
of the market implied volatility and historical volatility for the 5
year expected life; the risk-free interest rate is based on U.S.
Treasury securities with maturities equal to the expected life of the
option; and an eight percent forfeiture rate is assumed. The Company
uses historical data in order to estimate exercise, termination and
holding period behavior for valuation purposes.



The number of stock options and
weighted-average exercise prices
follows:

At
December  30,  2006, the range of exercise prices on
outstanding stock options was $19.34 to $51.84. Stock option expense
was $8.2  million for the year ended December  30,
2006. No stock option expense was recognized in the years ended
December  31,  2005 and January  1,  2005
because under APB 25, no compensation cost was recognized for stock
options when the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date was
equal to the amount per share the employee had to pay to acquire the
stock after fulfilling the vesting period.

The fair value
of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively:
dividend yield of 2.4%, 2.4%, and 2.6%; expected
volatility of 26%, 27% and 20%; and risk-free
interest rates of 4.2%, 4.4% and 3.3%. An expected
life of 5 years was used in each period and a weighted average vesting
period of 2.3 years in 2006 and 2.5 years in 2005 and 2004. The
weighted average fair value of stock options granted in 2006, 2005 and
2004 was $12.03, $11.44 and $6.76, respectively.

At
December  30,  2006, the Company had $14.1  million
of unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense for stock options. This
expense will be recognized over the remaining vesting periods which is
1.6 years on a weighted average basis.

For 2006,
the Company received $57.7  million in cash from the exercise of
stock options. The related tax benefit from the exercise of these
options is $12.9  million. During 2006, 2005 and 2004 the total
intrinsic value of options exercised was $35.5  million,
$23.3  million and $16.6  million, respectively. When
options are exercised, the related shares are issued from treasury
stock.

SFAS 123R requires
the benefit arising from tax deductions in excess
of recognized compensation cost to be classified as a financing cash
flow rather than as an operating cash flow as all
such tax benefits were classified under earlier
accounting guidance.  To quantify the recognized
compensation cost on which the excess tax benefit is computed, both
actual compensation expense recorded following the adoption of SFAS
123R on January  1,  2006 and pro-forma compensation cost
reported in disclosures under the previous SFAS 123
standard in earlier periods is considered. An
excess tax benefit is generated on the extent to which the
actual gain, or spread, an optionee receives upon exercise of an
option exceeds the fair value determined at the grant date; that excess
spread over the fair value of the option times the
applicable tax rate represents the excess tax benefit. In 2006, the
Company reported $4.1  million of excess tax benefits as a
financing cash flow.

Outstanding and exercisable stock
option information at December  30,  2006
follows:



Restricted Share
Units:

Compensation cost for restricted share units
(‘‘RSU’s’’) granted to employees is
recognized ratably over the vesting term, which varies but is generally
4 years. Non-employee members of the Board of Directors receive payment
for their service on the Board in the form of RSU’s which are
expensed immediately. RSU grants totaled 169,675 shares, 122,891
shares, and 107,293 shares in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
weighted-average grant date fair value of RSU’s granted in 2006,
2005 and 2004 was $49.28, $47.28 and $40.17 per share, respectively.
Total compensation expense recognized for RSU’s amounted to
$4.1  million, $2.5  million and $1.8  million,
respectively; and the related tax benefit recorded was $1.0
million, $0.6 and $0.6  million, respectively, in 2006, 2005 and
2004. As of December  30,  2006, unrecognized compensation
expense for RSU’s amounted to $9.5  million and this cost
will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

A summary of non-vested restricted stock unit activity as of
December  30,  2006, and changes during the twelve month
period then ended is as
follows:

The
total fair value of shares vested (market value on the date vested)
during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $5.2  million, $0.7
million, and $8.9  million,
respectively.

Additionally, non-employee members of the
Board of Directors received restricted share-based grants which must be
cash settled and accordingly mark-to-market accounting is applied. The
after-tax expense recognized for such grants amounted to $0.8
million in 2006, $0.6  million in 2005 and $0.4  million in
2004.

Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan:

The
Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (‘‘LTSIP’’)
provides for grants of awards to senior management employees for
achieving Company performance measures, specifically earnings per share
and return on capital employed. Awards are payable in shares of common
stock, which may be restricted if the employee has not achieved certain
stock ownership levels, and generally no award is made if the employee
terminates employment prior to the payout date. There are three award
cycles in progress: one for the two and one half year period ending in
December, 2006, the second for the three year period ending in
December, 2007, and the third for the three year period ending in
December, 2008. The ultimate issuance of shares, if any, is determined
based on performance over the three year cycle. The Company has accrued
for the expected issuance of shares based on estimates of future
performance in relation to the targets. Expense recognized for the
LTSIP plans amounted to $7.4  million in 2006, $6.4
million in 2005 and $1.6  million in
2004.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

The
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (‘‘ESPP’’)
enables substantially all employees in the United States and Canada to
subscribe at any time to purchase shares of common stock on a monthly
basis at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the shares
on the grant date ($40.37 per share for fiscal year 2006 purchases) or
85% of the fair market value of the shares on the last business
day of each month. A maximum of 6,000,000 shares are authorized for
subscription. During 2006, 2005 and 2004 shares totaling 64,590, 96,683
and 118,544, respectively, were issued under the plan at average prices
of $39.26, $33.19 and $26.78 per share, respectively and the intrinsic
value of the ESPP purchases was $0.6  million, $1.3
million and $1.7  million, respectively. For 2006, the Company
received $2.6  million in cash from ESPP purchases, and there is
no related tax benefit. The fair value of ESPP shares was estimated
using the Black Scholes option pricing model. ESPP compensation cost is
recognized ratably over the one year term based on actual employee
stock purchases under the plan and amounted to $0.5 million in 2006.
The fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the ESPP
was estimated using the following assumptions for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively: dividend yield of 2.4%, 2.4% and
3.1%; expected volatility of 23%, 27% and
20%;



risk-free interest rates of 4.3%,
2.4% and 2.2%; and expected lives of one year. The
weighted average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 2006,
2005 and 2004 was $9.70, $11.15 and $7.03,
respectively.

If compensation cost for the
Company’s stock option plans had been determined based on the
fair value at the grant dates consistent with the method prescribed by
SFAS No. 123, ‘‘Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation’’, net earnings and earnings per share would
have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated
below:

Compensation
cost relating to the stock based compensation grants made in 2005 and
earlier periods is recognized ratably over the vesting period using the
accelerated method. Effective with the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on
January  1,  2006, expense for new grants is recognized on
a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The expense for retiree
eligible employees (those aged 55 and over and with 10 or more years of
service) is recognized by the date they became retirement eligible, as
such employees may retain their options for the 10 year contractual
term in the event they retire prior to the end of the vesting period
stipulated in the grant.

COMMON STOCK EQUITY
HEDGE

The Company previously entered into equity hedges, in
the form of equity forwards on its common shares, to offset the
dilutive effect of in-the-money stock options on earnings per share and
to reduce potential cash outflow for the repurchase of the
Company’s stock to offset stock option exercises. Under the
former equity hedge contracts, when the price of the Company’s
common stock appreciated since the last quarterly interim settlement,
the Company received its common shares from the counterparties. When
the price of the Company stock depreciated since the last quarterly
interim settlement, the Company delivered its common stock from
treasury shares to the counterparties. Interim quarterly settlements
were in shares of common stock, not cash, and were accounted for within
equity. In April  2003, the Company settled $100  million
of the contracts through a cash repurchase of 3.9  million
underlying shares at that time. In June  2003, the remaining
$113  million in the Company’s common stock equity hedge
forward contracts were modified to full physical settlement contracts
with a fixed notional principal of $113  million and 4.1
million of underlying shares. As discussed in Note I Long-term Debt and
Financing Arrangements, all remaining outstanding principal was repaid
during 2005.

L. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE
LOSS

Accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of
each fiscal year was as
follows:



M.
EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT  PLANS

EMPLOYEE STOCK
OWNERSHIP PLAN
(‘‘ESOP’’)

Substantially all
U.S. employees may contribute from 1% to 15% of their
eligible compensation to a tax-deferred 401(k) savings plan, subject to
restrictions under tax laws. Employees generally direct the investment
of their own contributions into various investment funds. An employer
match benefit is provided under the plan equal to one-half of each
employee’s tax-deferred contribution up to the first 7%
of their compensation. Half of the employer match benefit is invested
in the Company’s common stock while the investment of the other
half is directed by the employee. Effective January  1,
2007, participants will direct the entire employer match such that no
participant is required to hold the Company’s common stock in
their 401(k) account. The employer match benefit totaled $7.9
million, $8.3  million and $7.3  million, in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

In addition, approximately 4,000 U.S.
salaried and non-union hourly employees receive a non-contributory
benefit under the Cornerstone plan. Cornerstone benefit allocations
range from 3% to 9% of eligible employee compensation
based on age. Approximately 1,500 U.S. employees receive an additional
average 1.7% contribution actuarially designed to replace
previously curtailed pension benefits. Allocations for benefits earned
under the Cornerstone plan were $13.2  million in 2006,
$12.3  million in 2005 and $12.6  million in 2004. Assets
held in participant Cornerstone accounts are invested in a broad-based
U.S. equity security index fund and U.S. government
bonds.

Shares of the Company’s common stock held by
the ESOP were purchased with the proceeds of external borrowings in
1989 and borrowings from the Company in 1991 (‘‘1991
internal loan’’). The external ESOP borrowings are
guaranteed by the Company and are included in long-term debt.
Shareowners’ equity reflects a reduction equal to the cost basis
of unearned (unallocated) shares purchased with the internal and the
external borrowings.

The Company accounts for the ESOP
under Statement of Position (‘‘SOP’’) 76-3,
‘‘Accounting Practices for Certain Employee Stock
Ownership Plans’’, as affected by the Emerging Issues
Task Force (‘‘EITF’’) 89-8,
‘‘Expense Recognition for Employee Stock Ownership
Plans.’’ Net ESOP activity recognized is comprised of the
cost basis of shares released, the cost of the aforementioned
Cornerstone and 401(k) match defined contribution benefits, interest
expense on the external 1989 borrowing, less the fair value of shares
released and dividends on unallocated ESOP shares. Net ESOP expense was
$2.4  million in 2006, $2.1  million in 2005 and
$2.2  million in 2004. ESOP expense is affected by the market
value of the Company’s common stock on the monthly dates when
shares are released. The market value of shares released averaged
$49.28 per share in 2006, $46.41 in 2005 and $43.20 in
2004.

Unallocated shares are released from the trust based
on current period debt principal and interest payments as a percentage
of total future debt principal and interest payments. Dividends on both
allocated and unallocated shares may be used for debt service and to
credit participant accounts for dividends earned on allocated shares.
Dividends paid on the shares acquired with the 1991 internal loan were
used solely to pay internal loan debt service in all periods. Dividends
on ESOP shares, which are charged to shareowners’ equity as
declared, were $11.7  million in 2006, $12.1  million in
2005 and $12.2  million in 2004. Dividends on ESOP shares were
utilized entirely for debt service in all years. Interest costs
incurred by the ESOP on the 1989 external debt in 2006, 2005 and 2004
were $0.3  million, $0.4  million and $0.7  million,
respectively. Interest costs incurred by the ESOP on the 1991 internal
loan, which have no earnings impact, were $9.2  million,
$9.5  million and $9.7  million for 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively. Both allocated and unallocated ESOP shares are treated as
outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share. As of
December  30,  2006, the number of ESOP shares allocated to
participant accounts was 4,185,747 and the number of unallocated shares
was 5,458,285. At December  30,  2006, there were 33,205
released shares in the ESOP trust holding account pending allocation.
The Company made cash contributions to the ESOP totaling $11.2
million in 2006, $13.3  million in 2005 and $10.2  million
in 2004.



PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT
PLANS

The Company sponsors pension plans covering most
domestic hourly and certain executive employees, and approximately
7,500 foreign employees. Benefits are generally based on salary and
years of service, except for U.S. collective bargaining employees whose
benefits are based on a stated amount for each year of
service.

The Company contributes to multi-employer plans
for certain collective bargaining U.S. employees. In addition, various
other defined contribution plans are sponsored worldwide. The expense
for such defined contribution plans, aside from the earlier discussed
ESOP plans,
follows.

The
components of net periodic pension expense (income) are as
follows:

The
Company provides medical and dental benefits for certain retired
employees in the United States. In addition, certain U.S. employees who
retire from active service are eligible for life insurance benefits.
Net periodic postretirement benefit expense was $2.7  million in
2006, $2.0  million in 2005 and $1.8  million in
2004.



The changes in the pension and
other postretirement benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets as
well as amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are
shown
below:



The accumulated benefit obligation
for all defined benefit pension plans was $428.1  million at
December  30,  2006 and $372.9  million at
December  31,  2005. Information regarding pension plans in
which accumulated benefit obligations exceed plan assets
follows:

Information
regarding pension plans in which projected benefit obligations
(inclusive of anticipated future compensation increases) exceed plan
assets
follows:

The
Company adopted SFAS 158 as of December  30,  2006. The
impact from recognizing the funded status of the defined benefit plans,
representing the fair value of the plan assets versus the projected
benefit obligation, was a decrease to Shareowners’ Equity of
$61.1  million, net of a $26.7  million tax benefit. The
Company uses a fiscal year end date to value all its plans. The
following table summarizes the impact of adopting SFAS 158 on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at December  30,
2006:

The
major assumptions used in valuing pension and post-retirement plan
obligations and net costs were as
follows:

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined
considering the returns projected for the various asset classes and the
relative weighting for each asset class as reflected in the target
asset allocation below. In addition the Company considers historical
performance, the opinions of outside actuaries and other data in
developing benchmark returns.



The amounts in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss expected to be recognized as components of net
periodic benefit costs during the next fiscal year total $9.5
million, representing amortization of $7.8  million of actuarial
loss, $1.4  million of prior service cost and $0.3  million
of net transition assets.

PENSION PLAN
ASSETS

Plan assets are invested in equity securities, bonds
and other fixed income securities, money market instruments and
insurance contracts. The Company’s weighted-average worldwide
actual asset allocations at December  30,  2006 and
December  31,  2005 by asset category are as
follows:

The
Company’s investment strategy for pension plan assets includes
diversification to minimize interest and market risks, and generally
does not involve the use of derivative financial instruments. Plan
assets are rebalanced periodically to maintain target asset
allocations. Maturities of investments are not necessarily related to
the timing of expected future benefit payments, but adequate liquidity
to make immediate and medium term benefit payments is
ensured.

CONTRIBUTIONS

The Company’s
funding policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts
determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and
future benefits in accordance with federal law and other regulations.
The Company expects to contribute approximately $17  million to
its pension plans and its other postretirement benefit plan in
2007.

EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS

Benefit
payments, inclusive of amounts attributable to estimated future
employee service, are expected to be paid as follows over the next 10
years:

These

assets and amounts to be contributed in the future by the
Company.

HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS

The weighted
average annual assumed rate of increase in the per-capita cost of
covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) is assumed to be
10.0% for 2006, reducing gradually to 6.0% by 2014 and
remaining at that level thereafter. A one percentage point change in
the assumed health care cost trend rate would have an immaterial effect
on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and the postretirement
benefit obligation as of December  30,  2006.

N.
OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES

Other-net is primarily comprised
of intangible asset amortization expense, gains and losses on asset
dispositions, currency impact, environmental expense and net expenses
related to the Mac Tools extended financing programs, mainly financing
receivable losses and interest income.

Research and
development costs were $15.3  million, $14.5  million and
$13.2  million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.



O. RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET
IMPAIRMENTS

At December  30,  2006, the
restructuring and asset impairment reserve balance was $63.1
million, which the Company expects to be fully expended by the end of
2007. A summary of the Company’s restructuring reserve activity
from December  31,  2005 to December  30,  2006
is as follows (in
millions):

Actions:

During 2006, the Company initiated a cost reduction
initiative in order to maintain its cost competitiveness and vitality.
Severance charges of $11.9  million were recorded during the year
relating to a reduction of 728 employees. Approximately $3.0
million of this charge pertained to the Consumer Products segment;
$4.5  million to the Industrial Tools segment; and $4.4
million to the Security Solutions segment. Of these amounts,
$9.3  million has been utilized to date, with $2.6  million
of reserves remaining as of December  30,  2006. In
addition to severance, $4.1  million for a U.K. pension plan
curtailment was recorded in Other, net and $1.3  million of
related consulting costs were recorded in
SG&A.

2005 Actions:

During 2005, the
Company initiated a $5.7  million cost reduction in various
businesses, of which $4.6  million was recorded in 2005 and
$1.1  million was recorded during 2006. The action was comprised
of the severance of 170 employees and the exit of a leased facility. Of
this amount, $5.0  million has been utilized to date with
$0.7  million of accrual remaining as of December
30,  2006. Approximately $4.3  million of this charge
pertained to the Security Solutions segment; $0.9  million to the
Industrial Tools segment; and $0.5  million to the Consumer
Products segment.

Pre-2005 Actions:

In the fourth quarter
of 2004, the company recorded $7.7 million of restructuring and asset
impairment charges — $4 million of restructuring costs in
connection with specific personnel actions to streamline/reposition
certain organizations primarily in the Consumer Products and Industrial
Tools segments; and $3.7 million of asset impairment charges primarily
associated with a 2004 information system strategy decision. As of
December 31, 2005, the accrual was fully expended. In addition, as of
December 30, 2006, $1.2 million of reserves remain relating to pre-2004
actions.

Acquisition Related:

During 2006, the
Company completed a consultation process with its European Works
Council regarding the reorganization of its Facom and Stanley hand
tools activities in Europe (these
‘‘Initiatives’’). These Initiatives will, among
other things, implement growth strategies and reduce costs by
rationalizing manufacturing, logistics, sales and support organizations
resulting in the severance of approximately 580 employees, the closure
of two legacy Facom factories in France, as well as four legacy Facom
distribution centers located in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany
and Switzerland. The facility rationalization
commenced recently with the severance of approximately
440 employees, closure of the two French factories and
exit from the United Kingdom distribution center. The Company
expects to complete these Initiatives during 2007. Cash
expenditures to be incurred for these Initiatives are estimated at
approximately $75  million, of which $59.4  million has
been recorded to the Facom purchase price allocation and
$0.7  million was reported as a 2006 restructuring
charge. As of December  30,  2006, $6.6  million has
been utilized to date, with $53.5  million accrual
remaining. Also, $1.4  million of asset impairments were
recorded to Cost of Sales relating to inventory rationalization
associated with the plant shut downs.

In connection with
its acquisition of National, the Company recorded $8.0  million
in severance costs for 243 employees and $0.3  million for
facility closure costs to the purchase price allocation, and
$0.2  million was recorded as a restructuring charge. As of
December  30,  2006, $5.8  million has been utilized
with $2.7  million accrual remaining.



Restructuring and asset impairment
charges by segment were as
follows:

P.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

The Company
reports the following three segments: Consumer Products, Industrial
Tools and Security Solutions. The Consumer Products segment
manufactures and markets hand tools, consumer mechanics tools, storage
units and hardware. These products are sold to retailers (including
home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards)
as well as through third party distributors. The Industrial Tools
segment manufactures and markets professional mechanics tools and
storage systems; pneumatic tools and fasteners; plumbing, heating, air
conditioning and roofing tools; hydraulic tools and accessories;
assembly tools and systems; electronic leveling and measuring tools;
and Stanley supply and services (specialty tools). These products are
sold to customers and distributed primarily through third party
distributors as well as through direct sales forces. The Security
Solutions segment is a provider of access and security solutions
primarily for retailers, educational and healthcare institutions,
government, financial institutions, and commercial and industrial
customers. The Company provides an extensive suite of mechanical and
electronic security products and systems, and a variety of security
services. The Company manufactures and markets automatic doors, door
locking systems, commercial hardware and integrates security access
control systems. Products in the Security Solutions segment include
security integration systems, software, related installation and
maintenance services, automatic doors, door closers, exit devices and
locking mechanisms.

The Company’s reportable
segments are an aggregation of businesses that have similar products
and services, among other factors. The following information excludes
the appliance hinge, U.K. decorator tools, home décor and German
paint roller businesses, which are classified as discontinued
operations as disclosed in Note T Discontinued Operations, unless
otherwise noted.



BUSINESS
SEGMENTS

In
connection with its recent acquisitions, the Company recorded $21.6
million in cost of sales (‘‘inventory step-up
amortization’’) during 2006 related to the initial turn of
acquired inventory which was written-up in purchase accounting to its
fair market value. This non-cash inventory step-up amortization
amounted to $8.2 million in the Consumer Products segment, $13.3
million in the Industrial Tools segment, and $0.1 million in the
Security Solutions segment.

The Company assesses the
performance of its reportable business segments using operating profit,
which follows the same accounting policies as those described in Note A
Significant Accounting Policies. Segment operating profit excludes
interest income, interest expense, other-net (which includes



intangible asset expense amortization),
restructuring charges and asset impairments, and income tax expense.
Refer to Note O Restructuring and Asset Impairments for the amount of
restructuring charges and asset impairments by segment, and to Note G
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for intangible amortization
expense by segment. Corporate and shared expenses are allocated to each
segment. Transactions between segments are not material. Segment assets
primarily include accounts receivable, inventory, other current assets,
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other
miscellaneous assets. Corporate assets and unallocated assets are cash,
deferred income taxes and certain other assets. Geographic net sales
and long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic regions based on
the geographic location of each Company subsidiary.

Sales
to The Home Depot were approximately 10%, 12% and
13% of consolidated net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, excluding the discontinued operations businesses
discussed in Note T Discontinued Operations. For 2006, 2005 and 2004
net sales to this one customer amounted to 21%, 26% and
27% of segment net sales, respectively, for the Consumer
Products segment, 5%, 6%, and 7%, respectively,
for the Industrial Tools segment and 2%, 2% and
3%, respectively, for the Security Solutions segment.

Q. INCOME
TAXES

Significant components of the Company’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each fiscal year were
as
follows:

Valuation
allowances reduced the deferred tax asset attributable to foreign and
state loss carry-forwards to the amount that, based upon all available
evidence, is more likely than not to be realized. Reversal of the
valuation allowance is contingent upon the recognition of future
taxable income and capital gains in specific foreign countries and
specific states, or changes in circumstances which cause the
recognition of the benefits to become more likely than not. The foreign
and state loss carry-forwards expire in various years beginning in
2007.

The classification of deferred taxes as of
December  30,  2006 and December  31,  2005 is
as
follows:



Income tax expense (benefit)
attributable to continuing operations consisted of the
following:

Income
taxes paid during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $104.5  million,
$112.8  million and $125.4  million, respectively. During
2006, the Company had tax holidays with Thailand and China. Tax
holidays resulted in a $3.1  million reduction in tax expense in
2006, a $1.7  million reduction in tax expense in 2005 and
$3.0  million in 2004. The tax holiday in Thailand is in place
until 2010 while the tax holiday in China varies between 2009 and
2015.

The reconciliation of federal income tax at the
statutory federal rate to income tax at the effective rate for
continuing operations is as
follows:

The
components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes
consisted of the
following:

The
Company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected
by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where the
statutory rates are lower. The Company is subject to the examination of
its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. The Company evaluates the likelihood of unfavorable
adjustments arising from the examinations and believes adequate
provisions have been made in the income tax
provision.

Undistributed foreign earnings of $436.7
million at December  30,  2006 are considered to be
invested indefinitely or will be remitted substantially free of
additional tax. Accordingly, no provision has been made for taxes that
might be payable upon remittance of such earnings, nor is it
practicable to determine the amount of this liability.



The American Jobs Creation Act,
the ‘‘Act’’, enacted on October
22,  2004 created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to
repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing for an 85
percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. In 2005, Stanley’s Chief
Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved a domestic
reinvestment plan as required by the
‘‘Act’’ to repatriate $249.6  million
in foreign earnings in fiscal 2005. Stanley recorded $15.6
million in tax expense related to this $249.6  million dividend.
All repatriations under the ‘‘Act’’ were
completed by December  31,  2005.

R. COMMITMENTS AND
GUARANTEES

COMMITMENTS

The Company has
non-cancelable operating lease agreements, principally related to
facilities, vehicles, machinery and equipment. Minimum payments have
not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $3.4  million due
in the future under non-cancelable subleases. In addition, the Company
is a party to synthetic leasing programs which qualify as operating
leases, for two of its major distribution centers. Rental expense, net
of sublease income, for operating leases was $51.3  million in
2006, $41.4  million in 2005 and $38.7  million in
2004.

Outsourcing and other commitments are comprised of:
$17.4  million for outsourcing arrangements, primarily related to
information systems and telecommunications; $13.7  million in
marketing obligations; and $0.7  million of cash funding
commitments pertaining to the Company’s U.S.
ESOP.

Following is a summary of the future commitments for
lease obligations, outsourcing and other
arrangements:

The
Company has numerous assets, predominantly vehicles and equipment,
under a one-year term renewable U.S. master personal property lease.
Residual value obligations under this master lease were $29.2
million at December  30,  2006 while the fair value of the
underlying assets was approximately $33.6  million. The U.S.
master personal property lease obligations are not reflected in the
future minimum lease payments since the initial and remaining term does
not exceed one year. The Company routinely exercises various lease
renewal options and from time to time purchases leased assets for fair
value at the end of lease terms.

The Company is a party to
synthetic leasing programs for two of its major distribution centers.
The programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, where
only the monthly lease cost is recorded in earnings and the liability
and value of underlying assets are off-balance sheet. As of
December  30,  2006, the estimated fair value of assets and
remaining obligations for these two properties were $61.0
million and $42.4  million, respectively.



GUARANTEES

Following
is a summary of guarantees as of December 30,
2006:

The
Company has guaranteed a portion of the residual value arising from its
previously mentioned synthetic lease and U.S. master personal property
lease programs. The lease guarantees aggregate $94.6  million
while the fair value of the underlying assets is estimated at
$71.6  million. The related assets would be available to satisfy
the guarantee obligations and therefore it is unlikely the Company will
incur any future loss associated with these lease guarantees.

The Company has issued $28.0  million in standby
letters of credit that guarantee future payments which may be required
under certain insurance programs. Shares of the Company’s common
stock held by the ESOP were purchased with the proceeds of external
borrowings in the 1980’s and borrowings from the Company in
1991. The external ESOP borrowings are guaranteed by the Company and
are included in long-term debt. Shareowners’ equity reflects a
reduction for the internal and external borrowings. The Company has
sold various businesses and properties over many years and provided
standard indemnification to the purchasers with respect to any unknown
liabilities, such as environmental, which may arise in the future that
are attributable to the time of the Company’s ownership. No
liabilities have been recorded for these general indemnifications since
there are no identified exposures. The
Company provides various limited and full recourse
guarantees to financial institutions that provide financing
to U.S. and Canadian Mac Tool distributors for their initial
purchase of the inventory and truck necessary to function as a
distributor. In addition, the Company provides
a full recourse guarantee to a financial
institution that extends credit to certain end retail customers
of its U.S. Mac Tool distributors. The gross amount guaranteed in these
arrangements is approximately $17.6 million and the $13.4
million fair value of the guarantees issued is recorded in debt and
other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance
sheet.

The Company provides product and service warranties
which vary across its businesses. The types of warranties offered
generally range from one year to limited lifetime, while certain
products carry no warranty. Further, the Company sometimes incurs
discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product
performance issues. Historical warranty and service claim experience
forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized. Adjustments are
recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes
available.

Following is a summary of the warranty
liability activity for the years ended December  30,  2006
and December  31,
2005:



S. CONTINGENCIES

The
Company is involved in various legal proceedings relating to
environmental issues, employment, product liability and workers’
compensation claims and other matters. The Company periodically reviews
the status of these proceedings with both inside and outside counsel,
as well as an actuary for risk insurance. Management believes that the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on operations or financial condition taken as a
whole.

The Company recognizes liabilities for contingent
exposures when analysis indicates it is both probable that an asset has
been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
impairment or loss can reasonably be estimated. When a range of
probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely
amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is
considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is
accrued.

In the normal course of business, the Company is
involved in various lawsuits and claims. In addition, the Company is a
party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory
agencies relating to environmental remediation. Also, the Company,
along with many other companies, has been named as a potentially
responsible party (‘‘PRP’’) in a number of
administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites,
including 15 active Superfund sites. Current laws potentially impose
joint and several liabilities upon each PRP. In assessing its potential
liability at these sites, the Company has considered the following:
whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms of existing
agreements, experience at similar sites, and the Company’s
volumetric contribution at these sites.

The
Company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and
remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation
of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and
includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws
and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated
sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for
recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and
remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are
reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and
legal information that becomes available. As of December
30,  2006 and December  31,  2005, the Company had
reserves of $30.5  million and $21.3  million,
respectively, for remediation activities associated with Company-owned
properties as well as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable
and estimable. Of the 2006 amount, $9.2  million is classified as
current and $21.3  million as long-term. The range of
environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is
$24.6  million to $61.2  million which is subject to change
in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental
remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded
on those sites in accordance with policy.

The
environmental liability for certain sites that have cash payments that
are fixed or reliably determinable have been discounted using a rate of
5.0%. The discounted and undiscounted amount of the liability
relative to these sites is $5.1  million and $8.1  million,
respectively, as of December  30,  2006 and $5.0
million and $8.1  million, respectively, as of December
31,  2005. The payments relative to these sites are expected to
be $1.0  million in 2007, $1.7  million in 2008,
$1.0  million in 2009, $0.3  million in 2010, $0.3
million in 2011 and $3.8  million thereafter.

The
amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on
estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to
reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes
available. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from
the estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain
exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future contingent
liability costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have
to pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts
recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

T. DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS

During 2006, the Company disposed of two small
businesses, the American appliance hinge and U.K. decorator tools
businesses, for $1.9  million in cash. The related after-tax loss
amounted to $1.1  million.



On December  4,  2004,
the Company sold its home décor business for $87  million
in a cash sale transaction, resulting in an after-tax gain of
$24  million. On March 2, 2004, the Company sold its residential
entry door business for $161 million in cash, and recognized a $95
million after-tax gain thereon. Also in 2004, the Company sold Friess,
its German paint roller business for $6.4  million, and a loss of
$3.6  million was recognized thereon.

In accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, ‘‘Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets’’, the
results of operations of the appliance hinge, U.K. decorator tools,
home décor, residential entry door, and Friess businesses for
the current and prior periods have been reported as discontinued
operations. In addition, the assets and liabilities of the appliance
hinge and U.K. decorator tools businesses were classified as held for
sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December  31,
2005. The divestures of these businesses were made pursuant to the
Company’s growth strategy which entails a reduction of risk
associated with certain large customer concentrations and better
utilization of resources to increase shareowner value.

The
American appliance hinge business supplied hardware used to manufacture
household appliances. The U.K. decorator tools business manufactured
brushes, rollers and other paint sundries supplied to various
retailers. The home décor business supplied mirrored closet
doors, closet organization products and wall décor products
primarily through large retailers in North America and Europe. The
residential entry door business manufactured and distributed steel and
fiberglass entry doors and components throughout North America. The
Friess business manufactured paint rollers in Germany and sold them
into the private label market in continental Europe. Operating results
of the U.K. decorator tools, home décor, residential entry door,
and Friess businesses, which were formerly included in the Consumer
Products segment, and the appliance hinge business, which was formerly
included in the Security Solutions segment, are summarized as
follows:

U.
SUBSEQUENT EVENT (Unaudited)

On January  16,
2007, the Company completed the purchase of HSM Electronic Protection
Services, Inc. (‘‘HSM’’) from Chicago-based
private equity firm GTCR for $545  million cash. HSM, based in
Lisle, Illinois provides security alarm monitoring services and access
control systems to commercial customers. The Company financed the
acquisition with proceeds from existing short term credit facilities
and a new $500  million 364-day bridge facility entered into on
January  8,  2007. The Company intends to refinance this
transaction in 2007 with a combination of available cash, and the
issuance of long-term debt and equity-linked securities.
