                                     Part I

    Item 1.   Business

    1(a) General Development of Business. On June 30, 1993, the Registrant sold
all of the stock of Taylor Rental Corporation, franchisor of the nation's
largest system of general rental centers for do-it-yourselfers and commercial
customers. On June 18, 1994, the Registrant sold the remainder of the business
consisting of the company-operated Taylor Rental stores.

    1(b) Industry Segment Information.  Industry segment
information on page 15 of Registrant's Annual Report to
shareholders for the year ended December 31, 1994 is incorporated
herein by reference.

    1(c) Narrative Description of Business.  Registrant's
operations can be classified into three industry segments:
Tools, Hardware and Specialty Hardware.

    Tools. The Tools segment consists of consumer, industrial and engineered
tools. Consumer tools includes hand tools such as measuring instruments, planes,
hammers, knives, wrenches, sockets, screwdrivers, saws, chisels, boring tools,
masonry, tile and drywall tools, paint preparation and paint application tools.
Industrial tools includes industrial and mechanics hand tools, including
STANLEY-PROTO(R) industrial tools and MAC(R) mechanics tools and high-density
industrial storage and retrieval systems. Engineered tools includes air tools,
hydraulic tools and STANLEY-BOSTITCH(R) fastening tools and fasteners.

    Hardware. The hardware segment consists of hardware such as hinges, hasps,
brackets, bolts, latches, closet hardware and organizer systems and other
shelving, screen and storm door hardware, hardware for sliding, folding and
pocket doors, residential door hardware, mirrors and mirrored closet doors.

    Specialty Hardware. The specialty hardware segment consists of residential
door systems such as original and replacement garage and entry doors,
power-operated doors and gates and home automation products, including garage
door openers and electronic controls.

    Competition. The company competes on the basis of its reputation for product
quality, its well-known trademarks, its commitment to customer service, the
breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on product innovation, and its
manufacturing efficiencies. The company is also striving to find new customers
both within the markets that it currently serves and in new

                                      -1-



markets around the world. As a part of this effort, the company is also
exploring new ways to reach its customers for example, through specialty product
catalogs, television sales and on-line services.

    The company encounters active competition in all of its businesses from both
larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and
services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. In
1994, the company invested approximately $70 million in facilities, new
equipment and technology in order to achieve operational excellence in
manufacturing, new product innovation and enhanced customer service.

    In the company's consumer hand tool and consumer hardware businesses, a
small number of competitors produce a range of products somewhat comparable to
the company's, but the majority of its competitors compete only with respect to
one or more individual products within a particular line. The company believes
that it is the largest manufacturer of consumer hand tools in the world and that
it offers the broadest line of such products. The company believes that its
market position in the U.S. and Canada for consumer hardware is comparable to or
greater than that of its major competitors and that it offers the broadest line
of hinges and home hardware, which represents the most important part of its
hardware product sales.

    In the company's industrial hand tool business in the U.S., the company
believes that it is a leading manufacturer of high-density industrial storage
cabinets. In the company's engineered hand tool business in the U.S., the
company believes that it is the leader in the manufacture and sale of pneumatic
fastening tools and related fasteners to professional contractors and to the
furniture and pallet industries as well as the leading manufacturer of portable
and mounted hydraulic tools.

    In the company's non-consumer hardware business in the U.S., the company
believes that it is a leading manufacturer of residential hardware products,
mirrored closet doors and hardware for sliding, folding and pocket doors; and a
leading supplier of closet rods, supports, brackets and wall mirrors.

    In the company's specialty hardware business, the company believes that it
is a leader in the U.S. with respect to the manufacture and sale of insulated
steel residential entry doors and power-operated sliding and swinging doors.

    Customers.  A substantial portion of the company's products
are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution
channels in the U.S.  A consolidation of retailers in these
channels is occurring.  These customers constitute a growing
percent of the company's sales and are important to the company's

                                      -2-


operating results. While this consolidation and the geographic expansion of
these large retailers provide the company with opportunities for growth, the
increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree
of exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of certain of the larger home
centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on each of the
company's business segments until either such customers are replaced or the
company makes the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business.
The company believes that the specific initiatives undertaken in order to
establish a strong foundation for growth will also help to address this issue.
These initiatives include product innovation, market development to reach new
customers and enhancing customer relationships. At the core of these efforts is
the Stanley Customer Support Division, which was established in 1994. The
mission of this Division is to make it easier for customers to do business with
the company's consumer divisions through the development of a common order
fulfillment system and a more efficient distribution network to support
customers. This initiative includes the development of a global information
infrastructure so that the company can provide a higher level of customer
service to its customers worldwide.

    Raw Materials. The company's products are manufactured primarily of steel
and other metals, although some are of wood or plastic. The raw materials
required are available from a number of sources at competitive prices and the
company has relationships of long standing with many of its suppliers. The
company has experienced no difficulties in obtaining supplies in recent periods.

    Backlog. At February 4, 1995, the company had approximately $155 million in
unfilled orders compared with $130 million in unfilled orders at February 5,
1994. All these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current
fiscal year. Most customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a result,
the company produces primarily for inventory, rather than to fill specific
orders.

    Patents and Trademarks. No segment of Registrant's business is dependent, to
any significant degree, on patents, licenses, franchises or concessions. The
company owns numerous patents, none of which are material to the company's
operations as a whole. These patents expire from time to time over the next 17
years. The company holds licenses, franchises and concessions, none of which
individually or in the aggregate is material to the company's operations as a
whole. These licenses, franchises and concessions vary in duration from one to
17 years.

    The company has numerous trademarks that are utilized in its businesses
worldwide. The STANLEY(R) and STANLEY (in a notched rectangle)(R) trademarks are
material to all three business

                                      -3-


segments. These well-known trademarks enjoy a reputation for excellence. In
addition, in the Tools segment, the Bostitch(R), Powerlock(R), Tape Rule Case
Design (Powerlock)(R), LaBounty(R), MAC Tools(R), Proto(R), Jensen(R),
Goldblatt(R) and Vidmar(R) trademarks are
material to the business.

    Environmental Regulations. The company is subject to various environmental
laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries where it has operations.
Future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will
likely increase the company's expenditures related to environmental matters.

     The company is involved with remedial and other environmental compliance
activities at some of its current and former sites. Additionally, the company,
together with many other parties, has been named as a potentially responsible
party ("PRP") in a number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of
various waste sites, including eight Superfund sites. Current laws potentially
impose joint and several liability upon each PRP. In assessing its potential
liability at these sites, the company has considered the following: the solvency
of the other PRP's, whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms of
existing agreements, experience at similar sites, and the fact that its
volummetric contribution at these sites is relatively small.

     The company's policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and
remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of
liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with
respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing
technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites. The amounts recorded do not take into account
any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As of December 31,
1994, the company had reserves of $24 million, primarily for remediation
activities associated with company-owned properties as well as for Superfund
sites.

    The amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on
estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Actual costs
to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent
uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision
in estimating future environmental costs, the company does not expect that any
sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the
amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

                                      -4-



    Power-generating Subsidiary. Under the General Statutes of Connecticut, the
company is deemed to be a "holding company" that controls an electric company as
a result of its being the sole shareholder of Farmington River Power Co., a
power-generating subsidiary of the company since 1916. Under such statute, no
organization or person may take any action to acquire control of such a holding
company without the prior approval of the Connecticut Department of Public
Utility Control.

    Employees. During 1994, the company had approximately 20,000 employees,
approximately 13,000 of whom were employed in the U.S. Of these U.S. employees,
approximately 23% are covered by collective bargaining agreements with
approximately 12 labor unions. The majority of the company's hourly- and
weekly-paid employees outside the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining
agreements. The company's labor agreements in the U.S. expire in 1995, 1996,
1997 and 1998. There have been no significant interruptions or curtailments of
the company's operations in recent years due to labor disputes. The company
believes that its relationship with its employees is good.

    1(d) Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export
sales. Geographic area information on page 15 of the Annual Report to
shareholders for the year ended December 31, 1994 is incorporated herein by
reference.

    Item 2. Properties.

    As of December 31, 1994, Registrant and its subsidiaries operated facilities
for manufacturing and distribution in 22 states and 20 foreign countries. The
Registrant believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its
business. The Registrant utilizes approximately 13,400,000 square feet of floor
space in its business, of which approximately 3,600,000 square feet of floor
space is leased.

    Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

    In the normal course of business, the company is involved in various
lawsuits and claims, including product liability and distributor claims. The
company does not expect that the resolution of these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued a Notice of Violation
and Reporting Requirement to the company's wholly-owned subsidiary
Stanley-Bostitch, Inc. noticing violation of the Rhode Island state
implementation plan, Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 15 at the
Stanley-Bostitch facility in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. On August 1, 1994,
the U.S. Department of Justice notified the company of its intention to

                                      -6-



bring a civil action against Stanley-Bostitch, Inc. relating to this matter and
at the same time offered to settle the matter for $550,000. The violations have
been corrected and settlement discussions are ongoing. The company believes that
this matter will not have a material adverse effect.

    Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

    No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the Registrant's last
fiscal year to a vote of security holders.

                                     -7-
