                                     Part I

    Item 1.   Business

    1(a) Introduction. (i) General. The Stanley Works ("Stanley" or the
"Company") was founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley and incorporated in 1852.
Stanley is a worldwide manufacturer and marketer of tools, hardware and
specialty hardware offering a wide range of products for home improvement,
consumer, industrial and professional use. Stanley(R) is a brand recognized
around the world for quality and value.

        In 1995, Stanley had net sales of $2.6 billion and employed
approximately 19,000 people worldwide. The Company's principal executive office
is located at 1000 Stanley Drive, New Britain, Connecticut 06053 and its
telephone number is (860) 225-5111.

        (ii) Strategic Restructuring. In July 1995, the Company announced a
multi-year restructuring program involving a fundamental review of the Company's
business units, product lines and how the Company operates, and established
goals for both restructuring and growth. The restructuring goal includes the
reduction of $150 million from the Company's cost structure (half of which is
targeted for reinvestment in the business) as well as a $250 million reduction
in working capital and other assets by the year 1997. The growth goal is to
achieve net sales of $4 billion in 1999.

        The Company has developed several key strategies to meet these goals.
The Company is currently evaluating all of its businesses and product lines to
determine their full potential. The Company intends to eliminate businesses,
product categories and product lines that are not performing. There is now
greater corporate involvement in setting and achieving operational goals and the
Company has made the sharing of resources a top priority company-wide. In order
to meet the goal for profitable growth, the Company is focusing on maintaining
and strengthening relationships with its key customers and is looking to
increase sales to international markets with a target of 40% of sales and
profits coming from these markets. Lastly, the Company has recognized that it
needs to fill key positions with the most talented people from both inside and
outside the Company.

    1(b) Industry Segment Information. Financial information regarding the
Company's industry segments is incorporated herein by reference from page 17 of
the Company's Annual Report to shareholders for the year ended December 30,
1995.

                                       -1-



    1(c) Narrative Description of Business. The Company's operations are
classified into three industry segments: Tools, Hardware and Specialty Hardware.

    Tools. The Tools segment manufactures and markets consumer, industrial and
engineered tools. Consumer tools includes hand tools such as measuring
instruments, planes, hammers, knives and blades, wrenches, sockets,
screwdrivers, saws, chisels, boring tools, masonry, tile and drywall tools,
paint preparation and paint application tools. Industrial tools includes
industrial and mechanics hand tools, including STANLEY-PROTO(R) industrial tools
and MAC(R) mechanics tools, and high-density industrial storage and retrieval
systems. Engineered tools includes STANLEY-BOSTITCH(R) fastening tools and
fasteners used for commercial, industrial, construction, packaging and consumer
use; hydraulic tools (these are hand-held hydraulic tools used by contractors,
utilities, railroads and public works as well as mounted demolition hammers and
compactors designed to work on skid steer loaders, mini-excavators, backhoes and
large excavators); and air tools (these are high performance, precision assembly
tools, controllers and systems for tightening threaded fasteners used chiefly by
vehicle manufacturers).

    Hardware. The hardware segment manufactures and markets hardware products
ranging from hinges, hasps, shelf brackets, bolts, latches to a line of closet
organizing systems and mirrored closet doors, door hardware and wall mirrors.

    Specialty Hardware. The specialty hardware segment manufactures and markets
residential insulated steel and reinforced fiberglass entrance door systems,
sectional roll up steel garage doors, automatic doors, remote control garage
door openers and electronic controls.

    Competition. The Company competes on the basis of its reputation for product
quality, its well-known brands, its commitment to customer service and strong
customer relationships, the breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on
product innovation, and its manufacturing efficiencies. The Company is also
striving to find new customers both within the markets that it currently serves
and in new markets around the world.

    The Company encounters active competition in all of its businesses from both
larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and
services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. In
1995, the Company invested approximately $87 million in facilities, new
equipment, technology and software in order to achieve operational excellence in
manufacturing, new product innovation and enhanced customer service.

    In the Company's consumer hand tool and consumer hardware


                                       -2-




businesses, a small number of competitors produce a range of products somewhat
comparable to the Company's, but the majority of its competitors compete only
with respect to one or more individual products within a particular line. The
Company believes that it is the largest manufacturer of consumer hand tools in
the world and that it offers the broadest line of such products. The Company
believes that its market position in the U.S. and Canada for consumer hardware
is comparable to or greater than that of its major competitors and that it
offers the broadest line of hinges and home hardware, which represents the most
important part of its hardware product sales.

    In the Company's industrial tool business in the U.S., the Company believes
that it is a leading manufacturer of high-density industrial storage cabinets.
In the Company's engineered tool business in the U.S., the Company believes that
it is the leader in the manufacture and sale of pneumatic fastening tools and
related fasteners to professional contractors and to the furniture and pallet
industries as well as the leading manufacturer of hand-held and mounted
hydraulic tools.

    In the Company's non-consumer hardware business in the U.S., the Company
believes that it is a leading manufacturer of residential hardware products,
mirrored closet doors and hardware for sliding, folding and pocket doors; and a
leading supplier of closet rods, supports, brackets and wall mirrors.

    In the Company's specialty hardware business, the Company believes that it
is a leader in the U.S. with respect to the manufacture and sale of insulated
steel residential entrance doors and power-operated sliding and swinging doors.

    Customers. A substantial portion of the Company's products are sold through
home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the U.S. A consolidation
of retailers in these channels is occurring. These customers constitute a
growing percent of the Company's sales and are important to the Company's
operating results. While this consolidation and the geographic expansion of
these large retailers provide the Company with opportunities for growth, the
increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree
of exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of certain of the larger home
centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on each of the
Company's business segments until either such customers are replaced or the
Company makes the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business.
The Company believes that the actions being taken in connection with one of the
five key initiatives of the Company's Restructuring Program, the initiative to
enhance customer relationships will help to preserve and strengthen these
relationships. These actions include: developing special partnership teams,
coordinating the Company's customer support systems to provide a wide variety of


                                       -3-




services from one source in the Company and improving logistics by consolidating
order fulfillment and distribution centers of the Company's consumer products
and centralizing credit services.

    Raw Materials. The Company's products are manufactured primarily of steel
and other metals, although some are of wood or plastic. The raw materials
required are available from a number of sources at competitive prices and the
Company has relationships of long standing with many of its suppliers. The
Company has experienced no difficulties in obtaining supplies in recent periods.

    Backlog. At February 3, 1996, the Company had approximately $137 million in
unfilled orders compared with $155 million in unfilled orders at February 4,
1995. All these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current
fiscal year. Most customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a result,
the Company produces primarily for inventory, rather than to fill specific
orders.

    Patents and Trademarks. No segment of the Company's business is dependent,
to any significant degree, on patents, licenses, franchises or concessions and
the loss of such patents, licenses, franchises or concessions would not have a
material adverse effect on any segment. The Company owns numerous patents, none
of which are material to the Company's operations as a whole. These patents
expire from time to time over the next 17 years. The Company holds licenses,
franchises and concessions, none of which individually or in the aggregate is
material to the Company's operations as a whole. These licenses, franchises and
concessions vary in duration from one to 17 years.

    The Company has numerous trademarks that are utilized in its businesses
worldwide. The STANLEY(R) and STANLEY (in a notched rectangle)(R) trademarks are
material to all three business segments. These well-known trademarks enjoy a
reputation for quality and value and are among the world's most trusted brand
names. In addition, in the Tools segment, the Bostitch(R), Powerlock(R), Tape
Rule Case Design (Powerlock)(R), LaBounty(R), MAC Tools(R), Proto(R), Jensen(R),
Goldblatt(R) and Vidmar(R) trademarks are material to the business.

    Environmental Regulations.  The Company is subject to various
environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign
countries where it has operations.  Future laws and regulations
are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely
increase the Company's expenditures related to environmental
matters.

     The Company is involved with remedial and other environmental compliance
activities at some of its current and former sites. Additionally, the Company,
together with many


                                       -4-




other parties, has been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") in a
number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites,
including nine Superfund sites. Current laws potentially impose joint and
several liability upon each PRP. In assessing its potential liability at these
sites, the Company has considered the following: the solvency of the other
PRP's, whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms of existing
agreements, experience at similar sites, and the fact that its volumetric
contribution at these sites is relatively small.

     The Company's policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and
remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of
liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with
respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing
technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into
account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As of
December 30, 1995, the Company had reserves of $24 million, primarily for
remediation activities associated with company-owned properties as well as for
Superfund sites.

    The amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on
estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Actual costs
to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent
uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision
in estimating future environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any
sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the
amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

    Power-generating Subsidiary. Under the General Statutes of Connecticut, the
Company is deemed to be a "holding company" that controls an electric company as
a result of its being the sole shareholder of Farmington River Power Co., a
power-generating subsidiary of the Company since 1916. Under such statute, no
organization or person may take any action to acquire control of such a holding
company without the prior approval of the Connecticut Department of Public
Utility Control.

    Employees.  During 1995, the Company had approximately 19,000
employees, approximately 13,000 of whom were employed in the U.S.
Of these U.S. employees, approximately 21% are covered by
collective bargaining agreements with approximately 11 labor
unions.  The majority of the Company's hourly- and weekly-paid


                                       -5-




employees outside the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining
agreements. The Company's labor agreements in the U.S. expire in
1996, 1997 and 1998.  There have been no significant
interruptions or curtailments of the Company's operations in
recent years due to labor disputes.  The Company believes that
its relationship with its employees is good.

sales. Geographic area information on page 17 of the Annual Report to
shareholders for the year ended December 30, 1995 is incorporated herein by

lawsuits and claims, including product liability and distributor claims. The
Company does not expect that the resolution of these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.
