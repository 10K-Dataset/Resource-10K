PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

1(a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

(i) General. The Stanley Works (“Stanley”) was
    founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley and incorporated in
    1852. Stanley is a diversified global provider of hand tools,
    mechanical access solutions and electronic security solutions.
    Stanley

®

is a brand recognized around the world for quality and value.

On March 12, 2010, Stanley completed a merger (the
    “Merger”) with the Black & Decker
    Corporation (“Black & Decker”).
    Black & Decker, which was incorporated in Maryland in
    1910, is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of power
    tools and accessories, hardware and home improvement products,
    and technology-based (engineered) fastening systems.
    Black & Decker enjoys worldwide recognition of its
    strong brand names and a superior reputation for quality,
    design, innovation and value. In connection with the Merger,
    Stanley changed its name to Stanley Black & Decker,
    Inc. Throughout this document, references to the
    “Company” refer to Stanley Black & Decker,
    Inc. The Company’s consolidated financial statements
    include Black & Decker’s results of operations
    and cash flows from March 13, 2010.

As detailed in Note E, Merger and Acquisitions, of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8,
    Black & Decker stockholders received 1.275 shares
    of Stanley common stock for each share of Black &
    Decker common stock outstanding as of the merger date.
    Outstanding Black & Decker equity awards (primarily
    stock options) were similarly exchanged for Stanley equity
    awards. After the exchange was completed, pre-merger Stanley
    shareowners retained ownership of 50.5% of the newly combined
    company. Based on the $57.86 closing price of Stanley common
    stock on March 12, 2010, the aggregate fair value of the
    consideration transferred to consummate the Merger was
    $4.657 billion.

Management believes the Merger is a transformative event
    bringing together two highly complementary companies, with
    iconic brands, rich histories and common distribution channels,
    yet with minimal product overlap. The Merger also enables a
    global offering in hand and power tools, as well as hardware,
    thus enhancing the Company’s value proposition to
    customers. Management believes the value unlocked by the
    anticipated $425 million in cost synergies, expected to be
    achieved by the end of 2012, will help fuel future growth and
    facilitate global cost leadership. This updated cost synergy
    estimate represents a $75 million increase from the
    original $350 million by March, 2013 at the time of the
    Merger. The cost synergy drivers are: business unit and regional
    consolidation (management, sales force and shared services
    integration), $145 million; purchasing (materials, freight
    etc.) $100 million; corporate overhead $95 million;
    and manufacturing and distribution facility consolidation,
    $85 million. The Company is ahead of plan on the
    integration of the two companies and realized $135 million
    of the cost synergies in 2010, which is $45 million more
    than originally forecasted for the nine month period that
    followed the merger. An additional $165 million of cost
    synergies are anticipated in 2011, and an incremental
    $125 million in 2012 to achieve the total cumulative
    $425 million in cost synergies in 2012. Of the
    $330 million in cost synergies pertaining to operations
    (all but the $95 million of corporate overhead), the
    benefit by segment is estimated to be 70% in CDIY, 20% in
    Security (mechanical access solutions), and 10% in Industrial.
    Management estimates there will be an additional
    $200 million in total costs, incurred over the next two
    years, to achieve these synergies from the Merger.

Additionally, it is projected that revenue synergies from the
    Merger will be in the range of $300 million to
    $400 million by 2013, which implies a benefit of
    $0.35 — $0.50 of earnings per diluted share. Revenue
    synergies are expected to add an incremental 50 basis
    points (approximately $50 million) to 2011 revenue growth
    and have a modest earnings impact, with remaining revenue
    synergies to be achieved in 2012 and 2013. The anticipated
    revenue synergies will come from: geographic expansion into
    Latin America and other emerging markets, leveraging
    pre-existing infrastructure (30%); channel and cross-selling of
    existing products, such as the sale of power tools through the
    Company’s industrial and automotive repair distributors
    (30%); brand expansion, i.e. utilizing the array of powerful
    brands in different product categories and channels and



expanding across the globe, as exemplified by the recent
    introduction of DeWalt hand tools in certain channels, (30%);
    and joint new product development, which entails leveraging
    development expertise from both legacy companies to pursue new
    product opportunities (10%). The CDIY segment is expected to
    realize approximately two-thirds of the revenue synergies, and
    the remainder will be split evenly in the Industrial and
    Security segments. In 2011, the Company intends to increase
    capital expenditures to 2.5% — 2.8% of revenues
    partially as a result of infrastructure improvements to foster
    attainment of the revenue synergies. In 2012 and beyond, the
    capital expenditure ratio is expected to return to more
    historical levels (2.0% — 2.5% of revenues) in 2012.

Net sales from continuing operations have increased from
    $3.7 billion in 2009 to a record $8.4 billion in 2010,
    primarily as a result of the Merger, double digit organic growth
    in the legacy Stanley Industrial segment, as well as the effects
    of several smaller acquisitions. The Company sold the CST/berger
    business in 2008 along with several other small divestitures in
    2008. Results have been recast for these discontinued
    operations. Refer to Note E, Merger and Acquisitions, and
    Note T, Discontinued Operations, of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
    discussion of acquisitions and divestitures over the past three
    years.

At January 1, 2011, the Company employed approximately
    36,700 people worldwide. The Company’s principal
    executive office is located at 1000 Stanley Drive, New Britain,
    Connecticut 06053 and its telephone number is

(860) 225-5111.

(ii) Restructuring Activities. Information regarding the
    Company’s restructuring activities is incorporated herein
    by reference to the material captioned “Restructuring
    Activities” in Item 7 and Note O, Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments, of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8.

1(b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

Financial information regarding the Company’s business
    segments is incorporated herein by reference to the material
    captioned “Business Segment Results” in Item 7
    and Note P, Business Segments and Geographic Areas, of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

1(c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

The Company’s operations are classified into three
    reportable business segments: Construction &
    Do-It-Yourself (“CDIY”), Security, and Industrial. All
    segments have significant international operations in developed
    countries, but do not have large investments that would be
    subject to expropriation risk in developing countries.
    Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the
    U.S. dollar translation of international operations in each
    segment.

After consummation of the Merger, the Black & Decker
    businesses were assessed and integrated into the Company’s
    existing reportable segments. The legacy Black &
    Decker segments: Power Tools and Accessories,
    Hardware & Home Improvement (“HHI”) and
    Fastening and Assembly Systems, were integrated into the
    Company’s CDIY, Security and Industrial segments,
    respectively, with the exception of the Pfister plumbing
    products business which was formerly part of HHI but is included
    in the CDIY segment. The results of Black &
    Decker’s operations are presented within each of these
    segments and reflect activity since the Merger date.

CDIY

The CDIY segment manufactures and markets hand tools, corded and
    cordless electric power tools and equipment, lawn and garden
    products, consumer portable power products, home products,
    accessories and attachments for power tools, plumbing products,
    consumer mechanics tools, storage systems, and pneumatic tools
    and fasteners. These products are sold to professional end
    users, distributors, and consumers, and are primarily
    distributed through retailers (including home centers, mass
    merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards). Hand tools
    include measuring and leveling tools, planes, hammers,
    demolition tools, knives and blades, screwdrivers, saws, chisels
    and consumer tackers. Corded and cordless electric power tools
    and equipment include drills, impact wrenches and drivers,
    wet/dry vacuums, lights, radios/chargers, grinders, various
    saws, polishers, plate joiners, jointers, lathes, dust
    management systems, routers, planers, tile saws, sanders, air
    tools, building instruments, air compressors, laser products,
    and
    Workmate

®

products. Lawn and garden products include hedge trimmers,
    string trimmers, lawn mowers, edgers, pruners, shears,
    shrubbers, blowers/vacuums, chain saws, and related accessories.
    Consumer portable power products include inverters,



jump-starters, vehicle battery chargers, rechargeable
    spotlights, and other related products. Home products are
    comprised of stick, canister and hand-held vacuums, flexible
    flashlights, paint tools and cleaning solutions. Accessories and
    attachments for power tools include drill bits, hammer bits,
    router bits, hacksaws and blades, circular saw blades, jig and
    reciprocating saw blades, diamond blades, screwdriver bits and
    quick-change systems, bonded and other abrasives and worksite
    tool belts and bags. Plumbing products consist of a variety of
    conventional and decorative lavatory, kitchen, tub and shower
    faucets. Consumer mechanics tools include wrenches and sockets.
    Storage systems include plastic boxes, sawhorses and storage
    units. Pneumatic tools and fasteners include nail guns,
    staplers, nails and staples that are used for construction,
    remodeling, furniture making, pallet manufacturing and other
    applications involving the attachment of wooden materials.

The Company’s product service program supports its power
    tools and lawn and garden products. Replacement parts and
    product repair services are available through a network of
    company-operated service centers. At January 1, 2011, there
    were approximately 100 such service centers, of which
    approximately 80 were located in the United States of America.
    The remaining centers are located around the world, primarily in
    Canada, Europe and Asia. These company-operated service centers
    are supplemented by several hundred authorized service centers
    operated by independent local owners. The Company also operates
    reconditioning centers in which power tools, lawn and garden
    products, and electric cleaning and lighting products are
    reconditioned and then resold through various company-operated
    factory outlets and service centers and various independent
    distributors.

Security

The Security segment provides access and security solutions
    primarily for consumers, retailers, educational, financial and
    healthcare institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and
    industrial customers. The Company provides an extensive suite of
    mechanical and electronic security products and systems, and a
    variety of security services. These include security integration
    systems, software, related installation, maintenance, and
    monitoring services, automatic doors, door closers, electronic
    keyless entry systems, exit devices, healthcare storage and
    supply chain solutions, patient protection products, hardware
    (including door and cabinet knobs and hinges, door stops, kick
    plates, house numbers, gate hardware, cabinet pulls, hooks,
    braces and shelf brackets), locking mechanisms, electronic
    keyless entry systems, keying systems, tubular and mortise door
    locksets. Security products are sold predominantly on a direct
    sales basis, distributed through retailers (including home
    centers) and in certain instances, through third party
    distributors.

Industrial

The Industrial segment manufactures and markets professional
    industrial and automotive mechanics tools and storage systems,
    metal and plastic fasteners and engineered fastening systems,
    hydraulic tools and accessories, and specialty tools. These
    products are sold to industrial customers including automotive,
    transportation, electronics, aerospace, machine tool and
    appliance industries and are distributed through third party
    distributors as well as through direct sales forces. Through its
    acquisition of CRC-Evans Pipeline International
    (“CRC-Evans”) in 2010, the Industrial segment also
    provides services and specialized tools and equipment such as
    custom pipe handling, joint welding and coating equipment used
    in the construction of large and small diameter pipelines.

Professional and automotive mechanics tools and storage systems
    include wrenches, sockets, electronic diagnostic tools, power
    tools, tool boxes and high-density industrial storage and
    retrieval systems. Metal and plastic fasteners and engineered
    fastening systems include blind riveting, stud welding,
    specialty screws, prevailing torque nuts and assemblies, insert
    systems, metal and plastic fasteners, and self-piercing riveting
    systems, as well as electric and pneumatic assembly tools. These
    are high performance precision tools, controllers and systems
    for tightening threaded fasteners used chiefly by vehicle
    manufacturers. Hydraulic tools and accessories are comprised of
    hand-held hydraulic tools and mounted hydraulic tools used by
    scrap yards, contractors, utilities, railroads and public works
    as well as mounted demolition hammers and compactors designed to
    work on skid steer loaders, mini-excavators, backhoes and large
    excavators. Specialty tools are used for assembling, repairing
    and testing electronic equipment.



Competition

The Company competes on the basis of its reputation for product
    quality, its well-known brands, its commitment to customer
    service, strong customer relationships, the breadth of its
    product lines and its innovative products and customer value
    propositions.

The Company encounters active competition in all of its
    businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the
    same or similar products and services or that produce different
    products appropriate for the same uses. The Company has a large
    number of competitors; however, aside from a small number of
    competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware
    businesses who produce a range of products somewhat comparable
    to the Company’s, the majority of its competitors compete
    only with respect to one or more individual products or product
    lines in that segment. Certain large customers offer private
    label brands (“house brands”) that compete across a
    wider spectrum of the Company’s CDIY segment product
    offerings. The Company is one of the largest manufacturers of
    hand and power tools in the world. The Company is a significant
    manufacturer of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners
    for the construction, furniture and pallet industries as well as
    a leading manufacturer of hydraulic tools used for heavy
    construction, railroad, utilities and public works. The Company
    also believes that it is among the larger direct providers of
    commercial access security integration and alarm monitoring
    services in North America and France.

Customers

A significant portion of the Company’s products are sold to
    home centers and mass merchants in the U.S. and Europe. A
    consolidation of retailers both in North America and abroad has
    occurred over time. While this consolidation and the domestic
    and international expansion of these large retailers has
    provided the Company with opportunities for growth, the
    increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a
    certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss. As a
    result of the Company’s diversification strategy, legacy
    Stanley sales to U.S. home centers and mass merchants
    declined from a high of approximately 40% in 2002 to 14% in
    2010. On a pro-forma combined basis (as if combined the entire
    year), Stanley and Black & Decker 2010 sales to
    U.S. home centers and mass merchants were approximately
    31%, including nearly 21% of sales to the combined
    Company’s two largest customers. As acquisitions in the
    various growth platforms (electronic/convergent Security,
    mechanical security, engineered fastening, infrastructure
    solutions and healthcare solutions) are made in future years,
    the proportion of sales to these valued U.S. home center
    and mass merchant customers is expected to decrease.

Raw Materials

The Company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous
    and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to steel,
    zinc, copper, brass, aluminum and nickel, and resin also
    represents a significant commodity used in production.
    Additionally, the Company uses other commodity-based materials
    for components and packaging including, but not limited to,
    plastics, wood, and other corrugated products. The raw materials
    required are procured globally and available from multiple
    sources at competitive prices. The Company does not anticipate
    difficulties in obtaining supplies for any raw materials or
    energy used in its production processes.

Backlog

Due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in most
    of the Company’s CDIY and Industrial segment businesses,
    backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of
    future performance. At February 5, 2011, the Company had
    approximately $705 million in unfilled orders.
    Substantially all of these orders are reasonably expected to be
    filled within the current fiscal year. As of February 6,
    2010 and February 2, 2009, unfilled orders amounted to
    $320 million and $348 million, respectively.

Patents and Trademarks

No business segment is dependent, to any significant degree, on
    patents, licenses, franchises or concessions and the loss of
    these patents, licenses, franchises or concessions would not
    have a material adverse effect on any of the business segments.
    The Company owns numerous patents, none of which individually is
    material to



the Company’s operations as a whole. These patents expire
    at various times over the next 20 years. The Company holds
    licenses, franchises and concessions, none of which individually
    or in the aggregate are material to the Company’s
    operations as a whole. These licenses, franchises and
    concessions vary in duration, but generally run from one to
    40 years.

The Company has numerous trademarks that are used in its
    businesses worldwide. The
    STANLEY

®

and STANLEY in a Notched
    Rectangle

®

trademarks are material to all three business segments. These
    well-known trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value
    and are among the world’s most trusted brand names. The
    Company’s tagline, “Make Something
    Great

    is the centerpiece of the brand strategy for all segments. In

trademarks are material to the Industrial segment. The terms of
    these trademarks vary, typically, from 10 to 20 years, with
    most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms.

Environmental Regulations

The Company is subject to various environmental laws and
    regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries where it has
    operations. Future laws and regulations are expected to be
    increasingly stringent and will likely increase the
    Company’s expenditures related to environmental matters.

The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has
    provided an affiliate of Black & Decker a “Notice
    of Potential Liability” related to environmental
    contamination found at the Centredale Manor Restoration Project
    Superfund site, located in North Providence, Rhode Island. The
    EPA has discovered a variety of contaminants at the site,
    including but not limited to, dioxins, polychlorinated
    biphenyls, and pesticides. The EPA alleged that an affiliate of
    Black & Decker is liable for site

clean-up

costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) as a
    successor to the liability of Metro-Atlantic, Inc., a former
    operator at the site, and demanded reimbursement of the
    EPA’s costs related to this site. The EPA released a draft
    Feasibility Study Report in May 2010, which identified and
    evaluated possible remedial alternatives for the site. The
    estimated remediation costs related to this Centredale site
    (including the EPA’s past costs as well as costs of
    additional investigation, remediation, and related costs such as
    the EPA’s oversight costs, less escrowed funds contributed
    by primary potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who have
    reached settlement agreements with the EPA), which the Company
    considers to be probable and reasonably estimable, range from
    approximately $68.3 million to $212.8 million, with no
    amount within that range representing a more likely outcome
    until such time as the EPA completes its remedy selection
    process for the site. The Company’s reserve for this
    environmental remediation matter of $68.3 million reflects
    the fact that the EPA considers Metro-Atlantic, Inc. to be a
    primary source of contamination at the site. The Company has
    determined that it is likely to contest the EPA’s claims
    with respect to this site. Further, to the extent that the
    Company agrees to perform or finance additional remedial
    activities at this site, it intends to seek participation or
    contribution from additional PRPs and insurance carriers. As the
    specific nature of the environmental remediation activities that
    may be mandated by the EPA at this site have not yet been
    determined, the ultimate remedial costs associated with the site
    may vary from the amount accrued by the Company at
    January 1, 2011.

The EPA and the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board
    have each initiated administrative proceedings against
    Black & Decker and certain of its current or former
    affiliates alleging that Black & Decker and numerous
    other defendants are responsible to investigate and remediate
    alleged groundwater contamination in and adjacent to a

160-acre

property located in Rialto, California. The cities of Colton and
    Rialto, as well as Goodrich Corporation, also initiated lawsuits
    against Black & Decker and certain of its former or
    current affiliates in the Federal District Court for California,
    Central District alleging similar claims that Black &
    Decker is liable under CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and
    Recovery Act, and state law for the discharge or release of
    hazardous substances into the environment and the contamination
    caused by those alleged releases. The City of Colton also has a
    companion case in California State court, which is currently
    stayed for all purposes. Certain defendants in that case have
    cross-claims against other defendants and have



asserted claims against the State of California. The
    administrative proceedings and the lawsuits generally allege
    that West Coast Loading Corporation (“WCLC”), a
    defunct company that operated in Rialto between 1952 and 1957,
    and an as yet undefined number of other defendants are
    responsible for the release of perchlorate and solvents into the
    groundwater basin, and that Black & Decker and certain
    of its current or former affiliates are liable as a
    “successor” of WCLC. The Company believes that neither
    the facts nor the law support an allegation that
    Black & Decker is responsible for the contamination
    and is vigorously contesting these claims.

In addition, the Company is a party to a number of proceedings
    before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to
    environmental remediation. Also, the Company, along with many
    other companies, has been named as a PRP in a number of
    administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste
    sites, including 36 active Superfund sites. Current laws
    potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each PRP.
    In assessing its potential liability at these sites, the Company
    has considered the following: whether responsibility is being
    disputed, the terms of existing agreements, experience at
    similar sites, and the Company’s volumetric contribution at
    these sites.

The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental
    investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability
    recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts
    with respect to each individual site and includes such factors
    as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations,
    and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The
    liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for
    recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and
    remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded
    are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
    technical and legal information that becomes available. As of
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, the Company had
    reserves of $173.0 million and $29.7 million,
    respectively, for remediation activities associated with
    Company-owned properties, as well as for Superfund sites, for
    losses that are probable and estimable. Of the 2010 amount,
    $25.9 million is classified as current and
    $147.1 million as long-term which is expected to be paid
    over the estimated remediation period. The range of
    environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is
    $157 million to $349 million which is subject to
    change in the near term. The Company may be liable for
    environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns.
    Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with
    policy.

The amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is
    based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically
    and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
    information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred
    in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the
    inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject
    to the imprecision in estimating future contingent liability
    costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to
    pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts
    recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or liquidity.

Employees

At January 1, 2011, the Company had approximately
    36,700 employees, nearly 14,400 of whom were employed in
    the U.S. Approximately 950 U.S. employees are covered
    by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 21 different
    local labor unions who are, in turn, affiliated with
    approximately 6 different international labor unions. The
    majority of the Company’s hourly-paid and weekly-paid
    employees outside the U.S. are not covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. The Company’s labor agreements in
    the U.S. expire in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. There have
    been no significant interruptions or curtailments of the
    Company’s operations in recent years due to labor disputes.
    The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is
    good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The Company’s business, operations and financial
    condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You
    should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described
    below, together with all of the other information in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K,

including those risks set forth under the heading entitled
    “Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995”, and in other documents that
    the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission, before making any investment decision with respect
    to its securities. If any of the risks or uncertainties actually
    occur or develop, the Company’s business, financial
    condition, results of operations and future growth prospects
    could change. Under these circumstances, the trading prices of
    the Company’s securities could decline, and you could lose
    all or part of your investment in the Company’s
    securities.

If the
    pace of recovery in the retail, residential and commercial
    markets in the Americas, Europe or Asia is sluggish, or general
    economic conditions do not improve, it could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company conducts business in various parts of the world,
    primarily in the United States and Europe and, to a lesser
    extent, in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, South
    America, Canada, Asia and Australia. As a result of this
    worldwide exposure, the Company’s businesses could be
    adversely affected by a decline in the U.S. and
    international economies, particularly with respect to
    residential and commercial markets, including, but not limited
    to recession, inflation or deflation. It is possible any such
    softness may result in an unfavorable impact on sales, earnings
    and cash flows. Also, any deterioration of retail, automotive,
    residential or commercial construction markets, changes in
    consumer purchasing power or in general economic conditions,
    could reduce demand for Company products and therefore have a
    material adverse effect on sales, earnings and cash flows. In
    addition, due to such economic conditions, it is possible
    certain customers’ credit-worthiness may erode resulting in
    increased write-offs of customer receivables.

The
    failure to successfully integrate the businesses of Stanley and
    Black & Decker in the expected time frame could
    adversely affect the Company’s future
    results.

The success of the Merger will depend, in large part, on the
    ability of the Company to realize the anticipated benefits,
    including cost savings, from combining the businesses of Stanley
    and Black & Decker. To realize these anticipated
    benefits, the businesses of Stanley and Black & Decker
    must be successfully integrated. This integration is complex and
    time-consuming. The failure to integrate successfully and to
    manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration
    process may result in the combined company not achieving the
    anticipated benefits of the Merger;

Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the
    integration process include the following:

•

the inability to successfully integrate the businesses of
    Stanley and Black & Decker in a manner that permits
    the combined company to achieve the cost savings anticipated to
    result from the Merger;

•

the inability to implement information technology system changes
    to get the combined businesses on common platforms;

•

lost sales and customers as a result of customers of either of
    the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined
    company;



•

complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex,
    combined business;

•

integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining
    focus on providing consistent, high quality products;

•

potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or
    regulatory conditions associated with the Merger; and

•

performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a
    result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by
    integrating the companies’ operations.

The
    Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial
    integration-related expenses resulting from the
    Merger.

The Company will continue to incur substantial expenses in
    connection with the Merger and the integration of
    Black & Decker including certain restructuring actions
    that may be taken to achieve synergies. Approximately
    $200 million of pre-tax restructuring and integration
    expense pertaining to the Merger is expected to be incurred over
    the next two years, in order to achieve an additional estimated
    $290 million of pre-tax annualized synergy benefits. There
    are a large number of processes, policies, procedures,
    operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated,
    including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing,
    payroll, manufacturing, marketing and benefits. While the
    Company has assumed an estimated $200 million of expenses
    will be incurred, there are many factors beyond its control that
    could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration
    expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred
    are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These
    expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the
    savings that the Company expects to achieve from the elimination
    of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of
    scale and cost savings. During 2010 the Company incurred
    $538 million of pre-tax merger and acquisition-related
    charges primarily related to restructuring costs associated with
    facility closures, employee severance charges, certain executive
    compensation charges, investment banking fees, and integration
    related advisory and consulting fees. While management believes
    the $200 million estimate is reasonable, the amount of
    future integration expense is not certain and could result in
    the Company taking significant additional charges against
    earnings in future periods.

The
    Company’s growth and repositioning strategies include
    acquisitions. The Company may not be able to successfully
    integrate the operations of recent acquisitions and the Company
    may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition
    candidates.

In 2002, the Company embarked on a growth strategy to shift its
    business portfolio toward favored growth markets through
    acquisitions and divestitures. The strategy has been advanced
    over the last several years with the Merger and the acquisition
    of a number of companies, including Stanley Solutions de
    Sécurité (“SSDS”), CRC-Evans Pipeline
    International (“CRC-Evans”), GMT, Infologix,
    Générale de Protection (“GdP”), Xmark
    Corporation (“Xmark”), Sonitrol Corporation
    (“Sonitrol”), and HSM Electronic Protection Services,
    Inc. (“HSM”).

The Company expends significant resources identifying
    opportunities to acquire new lines of business and companies
    that could contribute to its success and expansion into existing
    and new markets. Although the Company has extensive experience
    with acquisitions, there can be no assurance that recently
    acquired companies will be successfully integrated or that
    anticipated cost savings, synergies, or other benefits will be
    realized. If the Company successfully integrates the acquired
    companies and effectively implements its repositioning strategy,
    there can be no assurance that these acquired businesses will
    enjoy continued market acceptance or profitability.

In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
    able to successfully identify suitable future acquisition
    candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain the necessary
    financing, complete the transactions or successfully integrate
    the new companies as necessary to continue its growth and
    repositioning strategies. If the Company is unable to
    successfully integrate acquisitions, it could have a material
    adverse affect on its business, financial condition and future
    growth.



The
    Company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its
    business and operations.

In addition to the Merger, the Company made one other
    significant acquisition of CRC-Evans in 2010 in addition to nine
    smaller acquisitions, six small acquisitions in 2009, and a
    number of more significant acquisitions in 2008, including, but
    not limited to: GdP in October 2008 and Sonitrol and Xmark in
    July 2008. The Company may make additional acquisitions in the
    future. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:

•

the diversion of Company management’s attention and other
    resources,

•

the incurrence of unexpected liabilities, and

•

the loss of key personnel and clients or customers of acquired
    companies.

Any intangible assets that the Company acquires may have a
    negative effect on its earnings and return on capital employed.
    In addition, the success of the Company’s future
    acquisitions will depend in part on its ability to:

•

combine operations,

•

integrate departments, systems and procedures, and

•

obtain cost savings and other efficiencies from the acquisitions.

Failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions
    may adversely affect the Company’s existing businesses and
    harm its operational results due to large write-offs, contingent
    liabilities, substantial depreciation, adverse tax or other
    consequences. The Company is still in the process of integrating
    the businesses and operations of Black & Decker,
    CRC-Evans, SSDS and certain other smaller acquisitions made in
    the past two years. The Company cannot ensure that such
    integrations will be successfully completed, or that all of the
    planned synergies will be realized.

The
    Company has incurred, and may incur in the future, significant
    indebtedness, or issue additional equity securities, in
    connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the
    manner in which it conducts business or the Company’s
    access to external sources of liquidity. The potential issuance
    of such securities may limit the Company’s ability to
    implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a
    dilutive effect on earnings.

As described in Note H, Long-Term Debt and Financing
    Arrangements, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8, the Company has a committed revolving
    credit agreement, expiring in February 2013, supporting
    borrowings up to $800 million. Upon closing of the Merger,
    the Company entered into a $700 million revolving credit
    agreement that became effective on March 12, 2010 and will
    expire in March 2011. These agreements include provisions that
    allow designated subsidiaries to borrow up to $250 million
    in Euros and Pounds Sterling, which may be available to, among
    other things, fund acquisitions.

The instruments and agreements governing certain of the
    Company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or
    restrictive covenants that include, among other things:

•

a limitation on creating liens on certain property of the
    Company and its subsidiaries;

•

a restriction on entering into certain sale-leaseback
    transactions;

•

customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and
    is continuing, the Company might be required to repay all
    amounts outstanding under the respective instrument or
    agreement; and

•

maintenance of a specified financial ratio. The Company has an
    interest coverage covenant that must be maintained to permit
    continued access to its committed revolving credit facilities.
    The interest coverage ratio tested for covenant compliance
    compares adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation
    and Amortization to adjusted Interest Expense (“adjusted
    EBITDA”/“adjusted Interest Expense”); such
    adjustments to interest or EBITDA include, but are not limited
    to, removal of non-cash interest expense, certain restructuring
    and other merger and acquisition-related charges as well



as stock-based compensation expense. The adjustments to interest
    expense and EBITDA for purposes of this interest coverage ratio
    computation are defined in the debt agreements included as
    Exhibits 10.1, 10.2(a), 10.2(b) and 10.2(c) of this Form
    10K. The ratio required for compliance is 3.5 EBITDA to 1.0
    Interest Expense and is computed quarterly, on a rolling twelve
    months (last twelve months) basis. Under this covenant
    definition, the interest coverage ratio was approximately 11
    times EBITDA or higher in each of the 2010 quarterly measurement
    periods. Management does not believe it is reasonably likely the
    Company will breach this covenant. Failure to maintain this
    ratio could adversely affect further access to liquidity.

Future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may
    impose other restrictive conditions or covenants. Such covenants
    could restrict the Company in the manner in which it conducts
    business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth
    and repositioning strategies.

The
    Company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging
    arrangements.

From time to time the Company enters into arrangements with
    financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in
    currency and interest rates, including forward contracts and
    swap agreements. The failure of one or more counterparties to
    the Company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their
    obligations could adversely affect the Company’s results of
    operations.

The
    Company’s results of operations could be negatively
    impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions
    which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials,
    component parts, freight, energy, labor and sourced finished
    goods in a timely and cost-effective manner.

The Company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous
    and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to steel,
    zinc, copper, brass, aluminum and nickel, and resin also
    represents a significant commodity used in production.
    Additionally, the Company uses other commodity-based materials
    for components and packaging including, but not limited to:
    plastics, wood, and other corrugated products. The
    Company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for
    freight, energy and labor. The Company also sources certain
    finished goods directly from vendors. If the Company is unable
    to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer
    pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives, its
    profitability may be adversely affected.

Conversely, in the event there is deflation, the Company may
    experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices; there
    can be no assurance that the Company would be able to reduce its
    cost base (through negotiations with suppliers or other
    measures) to offset any such price concessions which could
    adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.

Further, as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic
    conditions, the Company believes it is possible that a limited
    number of suppliers may either cease operations or require
    additional financial assistance from the Company in order to
    fulfill their obligations. In a limited number of circumstances,
    the magnitude of the Company’s purchases of certain items
    is of such significance that a change in established supply
    relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of
    purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could
    result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or
    an inability to market products. An increase in value-added tax
    rebates currently available to the Company or to its suppliers,
    could also increase the costs of the Company’s manufactured
    products as well as purchased products and components and could
    adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.

Tight
    capital and credit markets could adversely affect the Company by
    limiting the Company’s or its customers’ ability to
    borrow or otherwise access liquidity.

The Company’s growth plans are dependent on, among other
    things, the availability of funding to support corporate
    initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the
    ability to increase sales of existing product lines. While the
    Company has not encountered financing difficulties to date, the
    capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and
    disruption in late 2008 and in early 2009. Market conditions
    could make it more difficult for the Company to borrow or
    otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate
    initiatives and acquisitions. In addition, there could be a
    number of follow-on effects from such a credit crisis



on the Company’s businesses, including: insolvency of key
    suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to
    obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company’s
    products

and/or

customer insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties
    and other financial institutions negatively impacting the
    Company’s treasury operations.

The
    Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates which could negatively impact
    profitability.

The Company manufactures and sell its products in many countries
    throughout the world. As a result, there is exposure to foreign
    currency risk as the Company enters into transactions and makes
    investments denominated in multiple currencies. The
    Company’s predominant exposures are in European, Canadian,
    British, and Asian currencies, including the Chinese Renminbi
    (“RMB”). In preparing its financial statements, for
    foreign operations with functional currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at
    current exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated
    using weighted-average exchange rates. With respect to the
    effects on translated earnings, if the U.S. dollar
    strengthens relative to local currencies, the Company’s
    earnings could be negatively impacted. In 2010, foreign currency
    translation positively impacted earnings by $0.04 per diluted
    share. The translation impact has been more material in the past
    and may be more material in the future. Although the Company
    utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as it deems
    appropriate, to mitigate a portion of potential market
    fluctuations in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance
    that such measures will result in all market fluctuation
    exposure being eliminated. The Company does not make a practice
    of hedging its

non-U.S. dollar

earnings.

The Company sources many products from China and other Asian
    low-cost countries for resale in other regions. To the extent
    the RMB or other currencies appreciate with respect to the
    U.S. dollar, the Company may experience cost increases on
    such purchases. The Company may not be successful at
    implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to
    mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability
    may be adversely impacted.

The
    Company’s business is subject to risks associated with
    sourcing and manufacturing overseas.

The Company imports large quantities of finished goods,
    component parts and raw materials. Substantially all of its
    import operations are subject to customs requirements and to
    tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements,
    bilateral actions or, in some cases unilateral action. In
    addition, the countries in which the Company’s products and
    materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time
    impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions
    on its imports (including restrictions on manufacturing
    operations) or adversely modify existing restrictions. Imports
    are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation
    which may increase the Company’s cost of goods sold.
    Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or the
    Company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs
    regulations or similar laws, could harm the Company’s
    business.

The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of
    international trade agreements and regulations such as the North
    American Free Trade Agreement, and the activities and
    regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these
    trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade
    liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by
    reducing or eliminating the duties

and/or

quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular
    country, trade agreements can also impose requirements that
    adversely affect the Company’s business, such as setting
    quotas on products that may be imported from a particular
    country into key markets including the U.S. or the European
    Union, or making it easier for other companies to compete, by
    eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the
    Company’s competitors source products.

The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and
    cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at
    ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and
    warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor
    disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security
    requirements in the U.S. and other countries. These issues
    could delay importation of products or require the Company to
    locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid
    disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available
    on



short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which
    could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and
    financial condition.

The
    Company’s success depends on its ability to improve
    productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce
    costs.

The Company is committed to continuous productivity improvement
    and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs, simplify or
    improve processes, and eliminate excess capacity. The Company
    has also undertaken restructuring actions, the savings of which
    may be mitigated by many factors, including economic weakness,
    competitive pressures, and decisions to increase costs in areas
    such as sales promotion or research and development above levels
    that were otherwise assumed. Failure to achieve or delays in
    achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from
    such measures, or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from
    manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in
    progress or contemplated, would adversely affect the
    Company’s results of operations.

Changes
    in customer preferences, the inability to maintain mutually
    beneficial relationships with large customers, inventory
    reductions by customers, and the inability to penetrate new
    channels of distribution could adversely affect the
    Company’s business.

The Company has certain significant customers, particularly home
    centers and major retailers, although no one customer
    represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales in 2010.
    However, on a pro-forma basis (as if Black & Decker
    were part of the Company’s results for the entire year
    2010), the two largest customers comprised nearly 21% of net
    sales and U.S. mass merchants and home centers collectively
    comprised approximately 31% of net sales. The loss or material
    reduction of business, the lack of success of sales initiatives,
    or changes in customer preferences or loyalties, for the
    Company’s products related to any such significant customer
    could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
    results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the
    Company’s major customers are volume purchasers, a few of
    which are much larger than the Company and have strong
    bargaining power with suppliers. This limits the ability to
    recover cost increases through higher selling prices.
    Furthermore, unanticipated inventory adjustments by these
    customers can have a negative impact on sales.

During 2009 the Company experienced significant distributor
    inventory corrections reflecting de-stocking of the supply chain
    associated with difficult credit markets. Such distributor
    de-stocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak
    end user demand and the broader economic recession. The
    Industrial segment generally sells to distributors where the
    Company does not have point of sale data to see end user demand
    trends; however, a substantial portion of the overall volume
    declines within the Industrial segment was believed to be
    attributable to such de-stocking or customer inventory
    adjustments. The Company’s results may be adversely
    impacted in future periods by such customer inventory
    adjustments. Further, the inability to continue to penetrate new
    channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the
    Company’s future results.

Customer
    consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business.

A significant portion of the Company’s products are sold
    through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in
    the U.S. and Europe. A consolidation of retailers in both
    North America and abroad has occurred over time and the
    increasing size and importance of individual customers creates
    risk of exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of certain
    larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s business until either such
    customers were replaced or the Company made the necessary
    adjustments to compensate for the loss of business.

If the
    Company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill,
    indefinite-lived trade names, or other definite-lived intangible
    assets, its net income and net worth could be materially
    adversely affected.

As a result of the Merger and previous acquisitions, the Company
    has $5.942 billion of goodwill, $1.652 billion of
    indefinite-lived trade names, and $1.220 billion of
    definite-lived intangible assets at January 1, 2011. The



Company is required to periodically, at least annually,
    determine if its goodwill or indefinite-lived trade names have
    become impaired, in which case it would write down the impaired
    portion of the intangible asset. The definite-lived intangible
    assets, including customer relationships, are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives; such assets are also evaluated for
    impairment when appropriate. Impairment of intangible assets may
    be triggered by developments outside of the Company’s
    control, such as worsening economic conditions, technological
    change, intensified competition or other factors resulting in
    deleterious consequences.

Income
    tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently
    recorded by the Company. Future tax law changes may materially
    increase the Company’s prospective income tax
    expense.

The Company is subject to income taxation in the U.S. as
    well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in
    determining the Company’s worldwide income tax provision
    and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for
    which the final income tax determination is uncertain. The
    Company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many
    tax jurisdictions. Although management believes the recorded tax
    estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome from any audit
    (or related litigation) could be materially different from
    amounts reflected in the Company’s income tax provisions
    and accruals. Future settlements of income tax audits may have a
    material effect on earnings between the period of initial
    recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the
    point of ultimate tax audit settlement. Additionally, it is
    possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that
    could have a material impact on the Company’s worldwide
    income tax provision beginning with the period that such
    legislation becomes effective. Also, while a reduction in
    statutory rates would result in a favorable impact on future net
    earnings, it would require an initial write down of any deferred
    tax assets in the related jurisdiction.

The
    Company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid,
    manage, defend, litigate and accrue for claims and litigation
    could negatively impact its results of operations or cash
    flows.

The Company is exposed to and becomes involved in various
    litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct
    of its business, including, from time to time, actual or
    threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial
    transactions, product liability, workers compensation, the
    Company’s distributors and franchisees, intellectual
    property claims and regulatory actions.

In addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws in
    each jurisdiction in which business is conducted. Some of the
    Company’s products incorporate substances that are
    regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts
    manufacturing operations. The Company could be subject to
    liability if it does not comply with these regulations. In
    addition, the Company is currently, and may in the future, be
    held responsible for remedial investigations and

clean-up

costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into
    the environment, including sites that have never been owned or
    operated by the Company but at which it has been identified as a
    potentially responsible party under federal and state
    environmental laws and regulations. Changes in environmental and
    other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign
    jurisdictions could adversely affect the Company’s
    operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential
    liability for non-compliance.

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
    continue to successfully avoid, manage and defend such matters.
    In addition, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating
    certain exposures, actual costs to be incurred in future periods
    may vary from the Company’s estimates for such contingent
    liabilities.

The
    Company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and
    violation of its trademark rights by imitators, or the failure
    of its licensees or vendors to comply with the Company’s
    product quality, manufacturing requirements, marketing
    standards, and other requirements could negatively impact
    revenues and brand reputation.

The Company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and
    value and are important to its success and competitive position.
    Unauthorized use of the Company’s trademark rights may not
    only erode sales of the Company’s products, but may also
    cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation,
    interfere with its ability to effectively represent the Company
    to its customers, contractors, suppliers,

and/or

licensees, and increase litigation costs. Similarly, failure by
    licensees or vendors to adhere to the Company’s standards
    of



quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss
    of revenue, increased litigation,

and/or

damage to the Company’s reputation and business. There can
    be no assurance that the Company’s on-going effort to
    protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance
    with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all
    violations.

Successful
    sales and marketing efforts depend on the Company’s ability
    to recruit and retain qualified employees.

The success of the Company’s efforts to grow its business
    depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives,
    its sales force and other personnel, including the ability of
    its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales
    organization and achieve adequate customer coverage. The Company
    must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate
    management, sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain
    its current business and support its projected growth. A
    shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the
    Company’s ability to implement its growth strategy.

The
    Company faces active global competition and if it does not
    compete effectively, its business may suffer.

The Company faces active competition and resulting pricing
    pressures. The Company’s products compete on the basis of,
    among other things, its reputation for product quality, its
    well-known brands, price, innovation and customer service
    capabilities. The Company competes with both larger and smaller
    companies that offer the same or similar products and services
    or that produce different products appropriate for the same
    uses. These companies are often located in countries such as
    China, Taiwan and India where labor and other production costs
    are substantially lower than in the U.S., Canada and Western
    Europe. Also, certain large customers offer house brands that
    compete with some of the Company’s product offerings as a
    lower-cost alternative. To remain profitable and defend market
    share, the Company must maintain a competitive cost structure,
    develop new products and services, lead product innovation,
    respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing
    products in a timely manner. The Company may not be able to
    compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its
    competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material
    adverse effect on its sales and profit margins.

The Stanley Fulfillment System (“SFS”) is a continuous
    operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the
    Company’s business such as procurement, quality in
    manufacturing, maximizing customer fill rates, integrating
    acquisitions and other key business processes. In the event the
    Company is not successful in effectively applying the SFS
    disciplines to its key business processes, including those of
    acquired businesses, its ability to compete and future earnings
    could be adversely affected.

In addition, the Company may have to reduce prices on its
    products and services, or make other concessions, to stay
    competitive and retain market share. Price reductions taken by
    the Company in response to customer and competitive pressures,
    as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to
    drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels,
    could also negatively impact its business. The Company engages
    in restructuring actions, sometimes entailing shifts of
    production to low-cost countries, as part of its efforts to
    maintain a competitive cost structure. If the Company does not
    execute restructuring actions well, its ability to meet customer
    demand may decline, or earnings may otherwise be adversely
    impacted; similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure
    are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the
    Company may lose market share and profits.

The
    performance of the Company may suffer from business disruptions
    associated with information technology, system implementations,
    or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other
    infrastructure.

The Company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and
    operate its businesses, and record and process transactions.
    Computer systems are important to production planning, customer
    service and order fulfillment among other business-critical
    processes. Consistent and efficient operation of the computer
    hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful
    sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many
    countries.



Despite efforts to prevent such situations, insurance policies
    and loss control and risk management practices, that partially
    mitigate these risks, the Company’s systems may be affected
    by damage or interruption from, among other causes, power
    outages, computer viruses, or security breaches. Computer
    hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient
    operations, such as

e-mail,

telephone and other functionality, is concentrated in certain
    physical locations in the various continents in which the
    Company operates.

In addition, the Company is in the process of implementing
    system conversions to SAP to provide a common platform across
    most of its businesses. There can be no assurances that expected
    expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be
    delays to the expected timing. It is possible the costs to
    complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations,
    and that significant costs may be incurred that will require
    immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization. The
    risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex
    system changes such as the SAP conversions are undertaken. If
    systems fail to function effectively, or become damaged,
    operational delays may ensue and the Company may be forced to
    make significant expenditures to remedy such issues. Any
    significant disruption in the Company’s computer operations
    could have a material adverse impact on its business and results
    of operations.

The Company’s operations are significantly dependent on
    infrastructure, notably certain distribution centers and
    security alarm monitoring facilities, which are concentrated in
    various geographic locations. If any of these were to experience
    a catastrophic loss, such as a fire, earthquake, hurricane, or
    flood, it could disrupt operations, delay production, shipments
    and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace
    the facility. The Company maintains business interruption
    insurance, but it may not fully protect the Company against all
    adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions.

Unforeseen events, including war, terrorism and other
    international conflicts and public health issues, whether
    occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our
    operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers or
    customers, or result in political or economic instability. These
    events could reduce demand for our products and make it
    difficult or impossible for us to manufacture our products,
    deliver products to customers, or to receive materials from
    suppliers.

If the
    investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as
    expected, the Company may have to contribute additional amounts
    to these plans, which would otherwise be available to cover
    operating expenses or other business purposes.

The Company sponsors pension and other post-retirement defined
    benefit plans. The Company’s defined benefit plan assets
    are currently invested in equity securities, bonds and other
    fixed income securities, and money market instruments. The
    Company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts
    determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current
    and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which
    require, among other things, that the Company make cash
    contributions to under-funded pension plans. During 2010, the
    Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of
    $277 million and it expects to contribute approximately
    $140 million to its defined benefit plans in 2011.

There can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit
    plan assets, or the investment returns on those plan assets,
    will be sufficient in the future. It is therefore possible that
    the Company may be required to make higher cash contributions to
    the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available
    for other business purposes, and that the Company will have to
    recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would
    decrease the net assets of the Company and result in higher
    expense in future years. The fair value of these assets at
    January 1, 2011 was $1.751 billion.

The
    Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts
    receivable.

The Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not
    generally covered by collateral or credit insurance. While the
    Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit
    risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no
    assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk
    and avoid losses, which could have an adverse affect on the
    Company’s financial condition and operating results.



Low
    demand for new products and the inability to develop and
    introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely
    impact the Company’s performance and prospects for future
    growth.

The Company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its
    ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner
    at favorable margins. The uncertainties associated with
    developing and introducing new products, such as market demand
    and costs of development and production, may impede the
    successful development and introduction of new products on a
    consistent basis. Introduction of new technology may result in
    higher costs to the Company than that of the technology
    replaced. That increase in costs, which may continue
    indefinitely or until and if increased demand and greater
    availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its
    cost, could adversely affect the Company’s results of
    operations. Market acceptance of the new products introduced in
    recent years and scheduled for introduction in 2011 may not
    meet sales expectations due to various factors, such as the
    failure to accurately predict market demand, end-user
    preferences, and evolving industry standards. Moreover, the
    ultimate success and profitability of the new products may
    depend on the Company’s ability to resolve technical and
    technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner,
    and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. The Company’s
    investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund
    advertising and product promotions in connection with these new
    products could erode profits if those expectations are not met.

The
    Company’s products could be subject to product liability
    claims and litigation.

The Company manufactures products, configures and installs
    security systems and performs various services that create
    exposure to product and professional liability claims and
    litigation. If such products, systems and services are not
    properly manufactured, configured, installed, designed or
    delivered, personal injuries, property damage or business
    interruption could result, which could subject the Company to
    claims for damages. The costs associated with defending product
    liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial.
    The Company’s reputation could also be adversely affected
    by such claims, whether or not successful.

The
    Company’s products could be recalled.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission or other applicable
    regulatory bodies may require the recall, repair or replacement
    of the Company’s products if those products are found not
    to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations. A
    recall could increase costs and adversely impact the
    Company’s reputation.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Strategic
    Objectives

The Company has maintained a consistent strategic framework
    since 2004:

•

Maintaining portfolio transition momentum by continuing
    diversification toward higher growth businesses, increasing
    relative weighting of emerging markets and opportunistically
    consolidating the tool industry;

•

Being selective and operating in markets where brand is
    meaningful, value proposition is definable and sustainable
    through innovation and global cost leadership is achievable;



•

Pursuing growth on multiple fronts through building existing
    growth platforms such as convergent security, mechanical
    security and engineered fastening and developing new growth
    platforms over time such as infrastructure and healthcare;

•

Accelerating progress via Stanley Fulfillment System
    (“SFS”).

Stanley has pursued this strategy which involves industry,
    geographic and customer diversification in order to pursue
    sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. In addition,
    the Company’s desire to be a consolidator of the tool
    industry and to increase its relative weighting in emerging
    markets has been significantly enhanced by the Merger. The
    impact of this diversification strategy is evident in the
    performance of the Company. Sales outside the
    U.S. represented 45% of the total in 2010, up from 29% in
    2002. When we embarked on the diversification strategy, legacy
    Stanley sales to U.S. home centers and mass merchants
    declined from a high of approximately 40% in 2002 to 14% in
    2010. On a pro-forma combined basis (as if combined the entire
    year), Stanley and Black & Decker 2010 sales to
    U.S. home centers and mass merchants were approximately
    31%, including nearly 21% in sales to the combined
    Company’s two largest customers. As acquisitions in the
    various growth platforms (electronic/convergent Security,
    mechanical security, engineered fastening, infrastructure
    solutions and healthcare solutions) are made in future years,
    the proportion of sales to these valued U.S. home center
    and mass merchant customers is expected to decrease. Execution
    of this strategy has entailed approximately $3.4 billion of
    acquisitions since 2002 (aside from the Merger), several
    divestitures and increased brand investment, enabled by strong
    cash flow generation and proceeds from divestitures.

The Company’s long-term financial objectives are:

•

4-6% organic revenue growth;

10-12%

total
    revenue growth;

•

Mid-teens EPS growth;

•

Free cash flow greater than equal to net income;

•

Return on capital employed (ROCE) between

12-15%;

•

Continued dividend growth;

•

Strong investment grade credit rating.

The Company’s long-term capital allocation objectives
    pertaining to the deployment of free cash flow are:

•

Invest approximately


/


in acquisitions and growth;

•

Return approximately


/


to shareowners as the Company remains committed to continued
    dividend growth and opportunistic share buy backs.

The long-term capital allocation strategy with respect to growth
    is focused on its growing existing platforms:
    electronic / convergent security, mechanical security,
    engineered fastening, infrastructure solutions, and healthcare
    solutions as well as further consolidating the tool industry.
    The Company plans to expand these existing platforms through
    both organic growth and primarily international acquisitions.
    The Merger rounded out the mechanical security product
    offerings, and brought with it another strong growth platform in
    engineered fastening.

Business
    Segments

The Company classifies its business into three reportable
    segments: Construction & Do It Yourself
    (“CDIY”), Security, and Industrial.

The CDIY segment manufactures and markets hand tools, corded and
    cordless electric power tools and equipment, lawn and garden
    products, consumer portable power products, home products,
    accessories and attachments for power tools, plumbing products,
    consumer mechanics tools, storage systems, and pneumatic tools
    and fasteners. These products are sold to professional end
    users, distributors, and consumers, and are



distributed through retailers (including home centers, mass
    merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards).

The Security segment provides access and security solutions
    primarily for consumers, retailers, educational, financial and
    healthcare institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and
    industrial customers. The Company provides an extensive suite of
    mechanical and electronic security products and systems, and a
    variety of security services. These include security integration
    systems, software, related installation, maintenance, monitoring
    services, automatic doors, door closers, electronic keyless
    entry systems, exit devices, healthcare storage and supply chain
    solutions, patient protection products, hardware (including door
    and cabinet knobs and hinges, door stops, kick plates, house
    numbers, gate hardware, cabinet pulls, hooks, braces and shelf
    brackets), locking mechanisms, electronic keyless entry systems,
    keying systems, tubular and mortise door locksets. Hardware and
    locking mechanisms are manufactured whereas certain other
    product offerings are sourced. Security products are sold
    primarily on a direct sales basis, and in certain instances,
    through third party distributors.

The Industrial segment manufactures and markets professional
    industrial and automotive mechanics tools and storage systems,
    metal and plastic fasteners and engineered fastening systems,
    hydraulic tools and accessories, and specialty tools. These
    products are sold to industrial customers including automotive,
    transportation, electronics, aerospace, machine tool, and
    appliance industries and are distributed through third party
    distributors as well as direct sales forces. The industrial
    segment also provides services and specialized tools and
    equipment such as custom pipe handling, joint welding and
    coating equipment used in the construction of large and small
    diameter pipelines.

After consummation of the Merger, the Black & Decker
    businesses were assessed and integrated into the Company’s
    existing reportable segments. The legacy Black &
    Decker segments: Power Tools and Accessories,
    Hardware & Home Improvement (“HHI”) and
    Fastening and Assembly Systems, were integrated into the
    Company’s CDIY, Security and Industrial segments,
    respectively, with the exception of the Pfister plumbing
    products business which was formerly part of HHI but is now
    included in the CDIY segment. The results of Black &
    Decker’s operations are presented within each of these
    segments and reflect activity since the merger date.

Significant areas of tactical emphasis related to execution
    of the Company’s strategic objectives, as well as events
    impacting the Company’s financial performance in 2010 and
    2009, are discussed below.

Merger

As discussed in Item 1 above, on March 12, 2010,
    Stanley completed the Merger. In connection with the Merger,
    Stanley changed its name to Stanley Black & Decker,
    Inc. Throughout this MD&A, references to the
    “Company” refer to Stanley Black & Decker,
    Inc. The Company’s consolidated financial statements
    include Black & Decker’s results of operations
    and cash flows from March 13, 2010.

As detailed in Note E, Merger and Acquisitions,
    Black & Decker stockholders received 1.275 shares
    of Stanley common stock for each share of Black &
    Decker common stock outstanding as of the merger date.
    Outstanding Black & Decker equity awards (primarily
    stock options) were similarly exchanged for Stanley equity
    awards. After the exchange was completed, pre-merger Stanley
    shareowners retained ownership of 50.5% of the newly combined
    company. Based on the $57.86 closing price of Stanley common
    stock on March 12, 2010, the aggregate fair value of the
    consideration transferred to consummate the Merger was
    $4.657 billion.

Management believes the Merger is a transformative event
    bringing together two highly complementary companies, with
    iconic brands, rich histories and common distribution channels,
    yet with minimal product overlap. The Merger also enables a
    global offering in hand and power tools, as well as hardware,
    thus enhancing the Company’s value proposition to
    customers. Management believes the value unlocked by the
    anticipated $425 million in cost synergies, expected to be
    achieved by the end of 2012, will help fuel future growth and
    facilitate global cost leadership. This updated cost synergy
    estimate represents a $75 million increase from the
    original $350 million by March, 2013 at the time of the
    Merger. The cost synergy drivers are: business unit and regional
    consolidation (management, sales force and shared services
    integration),



$145 million; purchasing (materials, freight etc.)
    $100 million; corporate overhead $95 million; and
    manufacturing and distribution facility consolidation,
    $85 million. The Company is ahead of plan on the
    integration of the two companies and realized $135 million
    of the cost synergies in 2010, which is $45 million more
    than originally forecasted for the nine month period that
    followed the merger. An additional $165 million of cost
    synergies are anticipated in 2011, and an incremental
    $125 million in 2012 to achieve the total cumulative
    $425 million in cost synergies in 2012. Of the
    $330 million in cost synergies pertaining to operations
    (all but the $95 million of corporate overhead), the
    benefit by segment is estimated to be 70% in CDIY, 20% in
    Security (mechanical access solutions), and 10% in Industrial.
    Management estimates there will be an additional
    $200 million in total costs, incurred over the next two
    years, to achieve these synergies from the Merger.

Additionally, it is projected that revenue synergies from the
    Merger will be in the range of $300 million to
    $400 million by 2013, which implies a benefit of
    $0.35 — $0.50 of earnings per diluted share. Revenue
    synergies are expected to add an incremental 50 basis
    points (approximately $50 million) to 2011 revenue growth
    and have a modest earnings impact, with remaining revenue
    synergies to be achieved in 2012 and 2013. The anticipated
    revenue synergies will come from: geographic expansion into
    Latin America and other emerging markets, leveraging
    pre-existing infrastructure (30%); channel and cross-selling of
    existing products, such as the sale of power tools through the
    Company’s industrial and automotive repair distributors
    (30%); brand expansion, i.e. utilizing the array of powerful
    brands in different product categories and channels and
    expanding across the globe, as exemplified by the recent
    introduction of DeWalt hand tools in certain channels, (30%);
    and joint new product development, which entails leveraging
    development expertise from both legacy companies to pursue new
    product opportunities (10%). The CDIY segment is expected to
    realize approximately two-thirds of the revenue synergies, and
    the remainder will be split evenly in the Industrial and
    Security segments. In 2011, the Company intends to increase
    capital expenditures to 2.5% — 2.8% of revenues
    partially as a result of infrastructure improvements to foster
    attainment of the revenue synergies. In 2012 and beyond, the
    capital expenditure ratio is expected to return to more
    historical levels (2.0% — 2.5% of revenues) in 2012.

Industrial
    Segment — Acquisition of CRC-Evans Pipeline
    International

On July 29, 2010, the Company acquired CRC-Evans Pipeline
    International (“CRC-Evans”) for a purchase price of
    $451.6 million, net of cash acquired. With fiscal 2010
    revenues of approximately $250 million, CRC-Evans
    immediately established a scalable, global growth business
    platform for the Company to capitalize on favorable end-market
    trends in the oil and gas infrastructure area. CRC-Evans is a
    supplier of specialized tools, equipment and services used in
    the construction of large diameter oil and natural gas
    transmission pipelines. CRC- Evans also sells and rents custom
    pipe handling and joint welding and coating equipment used in
    the construction of large and small diameter pipelines. The
    acquisition of CRC-Evans diversifies the Company’s revenue
    base and provides the Company with a strategic and profitable
    growth platform. CRC-Evans has been consolidated into the
    Company’s Industrial segment. The Company funded the
    acquisition with its existing sources of liquidity. This
    acquisition was slightly accretive to earnings in 2010 and the
    Company expects that it will be over $0.10 accretive to diluted
    earnings per share by 2013.

Continued
    Growth in the Security Segment

During 2010, the Company further advanced its strategy of
    becoming a global market leader in the commercial security
    industry. Annual revenues of the Security segment have grown to
    $2.113 billion, or 25% of 2010 sales, up from
    $216 million, or 10% of 2001 sales (the year the security
    expansion strategy was launched). Key recent events pertaining
    to the growth of this segment include the following:

•

As a result of the Merger, legacy Black &
    Decker’s hardware and home improvement (“HHI”)
    business contributed an additional 29% in sales in 2010, and on
    a pro-forma basis HHI sales grew 7% over 2009. The HHI
    Kwikset

®

and
    Baldwin

®

new product introductions fueled the higher sales.



•

The Company acquired Stanley Solutions de Sécurité
    (“SSDS”), formerly known as ADT France, on
    March 9, 2010 for $8 million, net of cash acquired.
    SSDS had approximately $175 million in 2009 sales. The
    acquisition is an indication of the Company’s continuing
    strategic intent to expand the security segment internationally
    and is highly complementary to the Company’s existing
    French security platform, Générale de Protection,
    acquired in 2008. Aside from restructuring charges, SSDS was
    neutral to earnings in 2010 as the majority of the integration
    benefits will begin to occur in early 2011.

•

In November 2010 the Company purchased 70% of the outstanding
    shares of GMT for $44 million, net of cash acquired. GMT is
    a leading commercial hardware manufacturer and distributor in
    China. The acquisition of GMT provides the Company with a low
    cost manufacturing source and also serves as a platform for
    international commercial hardware expansion. GMT had
    approximately $40 million in 2009 sales.

•

The Company acquired InfoLogix, Inc. in January 2011 for
    $61 million, net of cash acquired. Infologix is a leading
    provider of enterprise mobility solutions for the healthcare and
    commercial industries and will add an established provider of
    mobile workstations and asset tracking solutions to
    Stanley’s existing Healthcare Solutions growth platform.
    Infologix had $87 million sales in 2009.

The additions of the HHI business and the acquisitions discussed
    above complement the existing Security segment product
    offerings, increase its scale and strengthen the value
    proposition offered to customers as industry dynamics favor
    multi-solution providers that offer “one-stop
    shopping”.

Drive
    Further Profitable Growth in Branded Tools and
    Storage

While diversifying the business portfolio through expansion in
    the Company’s specified growth platforms is important,
    management recognizes that the branded tool and storage product
    offerings in the CDIY and Industrial segment businesses are
    important foundations of the Company that provide strong cash
    flow generation and growth prospects. Management is committed to
    growing these businesses through innovative product development,
    as evidenced by the success of the 12-volt max subcompact
    lithium ion cordless power tool products in the CDIY segment and
    the EXPERT tool product launch in the Industrial segment, brand
    support, an increased weighting in emerging markets, and
    relentless focus on global cost competitiveness to foster
    vitality over the long term. Acquisition-related growth will
    also be pursued where appropriate. The Merger is clearly an
    indicator of the Company’s commitment to this strategic
    objective.

Continuous
    Improvement from the Stanley Fulfillment System

The Company continues to practice the operating disciplines
    encompassed by the Stanley Fulfillment System (“SFS”)
    and has made further enhancements to it. As the SFS disciplines
    take hold, they will improve working capital
    turns / cash flow, and other efficiencies that will
    foster improved profitability. SFS employs continuous
    improvement techniques to streamline operations and drive
    efficiency throughout the supply chain. The newly enhanced SFS
    has six primary elements that work in concert: sales and
    operations planning (“S&OP”), operational lean,
    complexity reduction, global supply management,

order-to-cash

excellence and common platforms. S&OP is a dynamic and
    continuous unified process that links and balances supply and
    demand in a manner that produces world-class fill rates while
    minimizing DSI (Days Sales of Inventory). Operational lean is
    the systemic application of lean principles in progressive steps
    throughout the enterprise to optimize flow toward a pre-defined
    end state by eliminating waste, increasing efficiency and
    driving value. Complexity reduction is a focused and overt
    effort to eradicate costly and unnecessary complexity from our
    products, supply chain and back room process and organizations.
    Complexity reduction enables all other SFS elements and, when
    successfully deployed, results in world-class cost, speed of
    execution and customer satisfaction. Global supply management
    focuses on strategically leveraging the company’s scale to
    achieve the best possible price and payment terms with the best
    possible quality, service and delivery among all categories of
    spend.

Order-to-cash

excellence is a methodical, process-based approach that provides
    a user-friendly, automated and error-proof customer experience
    from

intent-to-purchase

to shipping and billing to payment, while minimizing cash
    collection cycle time and DSO (Days Sales Outstanding). Common
    platforms are an essential component of leveraging technology to
    facilitate organic growth and integration of acquired companies.
    The Company develops standardized business processes and system
    platforms to reduce costs and provide scalability. Other
    benefits of SFS include reductions in lead times, rapid
    realization of synergies during acquisition integrations, and
    focus on employee safety. SFS disciplines helped to mitigate the
    substantial impact of material and energy price inflation that
    was experienced in recent years. It was instrumental in the
    reduction of working capital during 2010 as evidenced by the
    improvement in working capital turns for legacy Stanley from 4.6
    in 2003 to 8.6 in 2010. Furthermore, working capital turns
    experienced a 10% improvement from 5.2 (including Black and
    Decker for the full year of 2009) at the end of 2009 to 5.7
    at the end of 2010. In 2011 and beyond, the Company plans to
    further leverage SFS to generate ongoing improvements in working
    capital turns, cycle times, complexity reduction and customer
    service levels.

Certain
    Items Impacting Earnings

Merger and Acquisition-Related Charges Impacting 2010 and 2009
    Earnings

The Company reported $538 million in pre-tax charges in
    2010, pertaining to the Merger and acquisitions which were
    comprised of the following:

•

$195 million in Cost of sales. Inventory

step-up

amortization stemming from the initial turn of the
    Black & Decker and CRC-Evans acquired inventories,
    which were

written-up

in purchase accounting to fair value, amounted to
    $174 million. Additionally, Cost of sales includes
    $21 million of facility closure-related charges;

•

$82 million in Selling, general & administrative
    (“SG&A”) for certain executive and merger-related
    compensation costs and integration-related consulting fees;

•

$37 million in Other, net for transaction costs inclusive
    of $20 million of pension curtailment gains.

•

$224 million in Restructuring and asset impairment charges
    primarily for severance (including costs for certain
    Black & Decker executives triggered by the change in
    control), as well as charges associated with the closure of
    facilities.

The tax effect on the above charges during 2010, some of which
    were not tax deductible, was $117 million, resulting in
    after-tax merger and acquisition-related charges of
    $421 million, or $2.80 per diluted share



In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company incurred
    $18 million in after-tax charges, or $0.22 per diluted
    share, primarily related to the transaction and integration
    planning costs associated with the Merger.

Throughout this MD&A, the Company has provided a discussion
    of the outlook and results both inclusive and exclusive of the
    merger and acquisition-related charges. The amounts and
    measures, including gross profit and segment profit, on a basis
    excluding such charges are considered relevant to aid analysis
    and understanding of the Company’s results aside from the
    material impact of the merger and acquisition-related charges;
    the measures are utilized internally by management to understand
    business trends, as once the aforementioned anticipated cost
    synergies from the Black & Decker integration are
    realized such charges are expected to subside.

Other
    Items

Aside from the costs associated with the Merger and acquisitions
    discussed above, other matters having a significant impact on
    the Company’s results in the 2008 — 2010 period
    were inflation, currency exchange rate fluctuations, debt
    extinguishment gains, and other restructuring actions.

•

The Company experienced inflation (primarily commodity and
    freight) of approximately $70 million and $140 million
    in 2010 and 2008, respectively, while it experienced mild
    deflation in 2009. Cumulatively, during 2008 — 2010
    the Company recovered more than two thirds of inflation through
    customer pricing. However, price erosion occurred in 2010 and
    the net unfavorable price / inflation impact for 2010
    was over $120 million. There is typically a several month
    lag between when inflation impacts costs and subsequent recovery
    through pricing actions. Management anticipates approximately
    one-third to one-half of inflation will be recovered through
    price in 2011. This lower recovery rate compared to historical
    levels reflects the more challenging competitive dynamics
    following the combination with Black & Decker, as well
    as the fact that the more rigorous legacy Stanley approach to
    pricing disciplines and rhythms is in the process of being
    implemented at legacy Black & Decker. The successful
    introduction of lithium ion power tools represents a catch up of
    the technology with several key competitors, and as a result it
    may be more difficult to implement pricing actions for certain
    products in the near term. The Company has recently experienced

10-20%

increases in various commodity costs, particularly steel, resin,
    and copper. Inflationary trends are expected to continue in 2011
    with an expected negative 100 basis point impact to
    aggregate segment profit. This impact includes management’s
    expectations for commodity inflation, as well as wages, and
    approximately 3% appreciation of the Chinese RMB which affects
    the cost of products and components sourced from China.

•

In the second quarter of 2010, the Company recognized an income
    tax benefit attributable to the settlement of certain tax
    contingencies of $36 million, or $0.21 per diluted share.

•

The fluctuation of foreign currencies impacts the translation of
    foreign currency-denominated operating results into
    U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation contributed an
    estimated favorable impact of $0.04 of diluted earnings per
    share from continuing operations in 2010, an unfavourable impact
    of $0.04 in 2009 and a favorable impact of $0.09 in 2008.
    Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the
    U.S. dollar may have a significant impact, either positive
    or negative, on future earnings. Refer to the Market Risk
    section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    (“MD&A”) for further discussion.

•

In 2009 the Company realized a $0.34 per diluted share gain on
    debt extinguishment, as compared with an $0.08 per diluted share
    gain in 2008.

•

The Company took decisive action to right-size its cost
    structure in response to slowing demand due to the recessionary
    environment in 2008 and 2009. Refer to the previously discussed
    merger and acquisition-related charges for the 2010
    restructuring impact. Restructuring, asset impairment and
    related pre-tax charges totalled $45 million and
    $92 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Employee
    headcount was reduced by approximately 3,000 as a result of
    restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 and
    through year end 2009. The total 2009 cost savings from the
    various actions taken were approximately $265 million,
    pre-tax, of which approximately $150 million pertained to
    selling, general and administrative functions.



Outlook
    for 2011

This outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight
    into the Company’s near-term earnings prospects, and not to
    discuss the various factors affecting such projections.
    Management expects earnings per diluted share (“EPS”)
    to be in the range of $4.29 to $4.54 in 2011. Excluding the
    effects of merger and acquisition-related charges, 2011 EPS is
    expected to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.00.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Below is a summary of the Company’s operating results at
    the consolidated level, followed by an overview of business
    segment performance.

Terminology:

The terms “legacy
    Stanley”, “organic” and “core” are
    utilized to describe results aside from the impact of the Merger
    and acquisitions during their initial 12 months of
    ownership. This ensures appropriate comparability to operating
    results of prior periods.

The Company has included information as if the Merger had
    occurred on January 3, 2010 for the year ended
    January 1, 2011 (“pro forma” information) which
    also includes a discussion regarding legacy Black &
    Decker’s performance in relation to the prior year on a
    basis reflecting the post-merger segment organization. This
    “pro forma” analysis is provided to aid understanding
    of the Black & Decker business trends compared to the
    prior year since the Merger occurred March 12, 2010, and
    accordingly the Company’s 2009 reported results solely
    reflect legacy Stanley.

Net Sales:

Net sales from continuing
    operations were $8.410 billion in 2010, as compared to
    $3.737 billion in 2009, a 125% increase. The Merger
    provided a 114% increase to sales, along with 6% from other
    acquisitions, primarily SSDS and CRC-Evans. Organic unit volume
    increased 5%, while price and currency were both flat compared
    to the prior year. Organic sales growth was driven by the
    successful launch of various new products which generally have
    been well received by customers, and overall improvement in end
    market demand, especially in industrial and emerging markets. By
    segment, legacy Stanley unit volume increased 3% in CDIY,
    decreased 3% in Security, which was negatively impacted by the
    continued weakness in U.S. commercial construction markets
    along with a large U.S. retailer’s inventory
    correction, and increased 21% in Industrial. The Industrial
    segment benefited from strong end user demand, market share
    gain, and global customer re-stocking in certain distribution
    channels which subsided by the fourth quarter. On a geographic
    basis, legacy Stanley unit volume sales increased 3% in the
    Americas (17% in Latin America), 6% in Europe, and 20% in the
    Asian region. On a pro forma basis, the legacy Black &
    Decker business achieved strong unit volume growth of 11%,
    reflecting positive end market demand including robust sales
    growth in emerging markets, along with strong new product
    performance, particularly the 12-volt lithium ion power tools.

Net sales from continuing operations were $3.737 billion in
    2009, as compared to $4.426 billion in 2008, a 16%
    decrease. Price increases provided a 2% sales benefit in 2009,
    which was offset by 2% from unfavorable foreign currency
    translation in all regions, with the largest impact in Europe.
    Acquisitions within the Security segment, primarily the
    carryover effect from the 2008 Sonitrol, GdP and Scan Module
    acquisitions, contributed a 4% increase in net sales. Organic
    unit volume declined 20% reflecting weak global economic
    conditions. Geographically, 2009 volume decrease was most severe
    in Europe at 24%, as compared with 18% in the Americas and 11%
    in the less significant Asian region. The Industrial and CDIY
    segments, with their high European content, experienced 31% and
    21% unit volume declines, respectively, while the Security
    segment had the best performance with only an 8% drop in organic
    volume. Aside from reduced end user demand, the Industrial
    segment was adversely affected by inventory de-stocking
    throughout the supply chain which abated by the end of the
    fourth quarter. The consolidated organic sales unit volume
    decline was 19% in the first quarter of 2009, deteriorated to
    24% in the second quarter, and improved sequentially to 20% in
    the third quarter and again to 16% in the fourth quarter. The
    sequential percentage improvements in the 2009 fiscal quarters
    partly relate to easier comparisons to 2008, which had a
    challenging second half when the recession deepened, but also
    reflected some encouraging macro-economic trends. The CDIY
    segment was most affected by the residential construction
    market, which appeared to have stabilized, as well as consumer
    confidence which improved in the U.S. and Europe in the
    second half of 2009.



Gross Profit:

The Company reported gross
    profit from continuing operations of $2.949 billion, or 35%
    of net sales, in 2010, compared to $1.508 billion, or 40%
    of net sales, in 2009. The addition of Black & Decker
    and acquired companies results was a main driver to the overall
    increase in gross margin. Gross margin was negatively impacted
    by $195 million of merger and acquisition-related charges
    as previously discussed, pertaining to the inventory

step-up

amortization from the initial turn of Black & Decker
    and CRC-Evan’s inventories and facility closure costs.
    Aside from merger and acquisition-related charges, legacy
    Stanley gross margin increased to $1.538 billion, or 39% of
    net sales, in 2010. This performance by legacy Stanley was
    driven by sales volume leverage, benefits from prior year
    restructuring actions, and the continued execution of
    productivity initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable
    commodity inflation. The Company expects continued commodity
    inflation pressures and that such inflation net of partial
    customer pricing recoveries will negatively impact gross margin
    by approximately 100 basis points in 2011. Despite
    inflation, an overall expansion of gross margin rates is
    expected in 2011 as integration cost synergies, integration and
    other productivity project benefits are realized.

The Company reported gross profit from continuing operations of
    $1.508 billion, or 40% of net sales, in 2009, compared to
    $1.671 billion, or 38% of net sales, in 2008. Acquisitions
    within the Security segment contributed $100 million of
    gross profit in 2009. Core gross profit for 2009 was
    $1.408 billion, down $186 million from the prior year
    due to the previously discussed sales volume pressures
    pertaining to broad economic weakness, and to a much smaller
    extent unfavorable foreign currency translation. The 40% core
    gross margin rate represented a record rate for the Company, up
    nearly 200 basis points versus the prior year. Several
    factors enabled the strong performance with respect to the gross
    margin rate, including the carryover effect of customer pricing
    increases implemented to help recover the significant inflation
    experienced in 2008. Inflation abated in 2009 such that lower
    commodity costs offset the gross margin rate impact of cost
    under-absorption associated with lower volume. Tight operational
    management, reflecting the disciplines of the previously
    discussed Stanley Fulfillment System, enabled substantial
    benefits from productivity projects and the execution of cost
    reduction actions taken in response to slower demand. The gross
    margin rate was further bolstered by improved sales mix
    associated with the Security segment.

SG&A Expense:

Selling, general and
    administrative expenses, inclusive of the provision for doubtful
    accounts (“SG&A”), were $2.169 billion, or
    25.8% of net sales, in 2010 as compared with
    $1.028 billion, or 27.5% of net sales in 2009. Merger and
    acquisition-related charges totaled $82 million in 2010 and
    $5 million in 2009 for certain executive and merger-related
    compensation costs and integration-related consulting fees.
    Black & Decker and acquisitions contributed an
    additional $985 million of operating SG&A. The
    remaining increase in SG&A primarily relates to corporate
    overhead, discussed below, investments to fund future growth,
    and the reinstatement of certain U.S. retirement benefits
    that were temporarily suspended in 2009 cost saving measures.
    Excluding merger and acquisition-related charges, SG&A for
    2010 was $2.087 billion, or 24.8% of net sales. The
    improvement in the SG&A rate (as a percentage of sales)
    mainly reflects sales volume leverage, savings from
    restructuring actions and cost synergies, along with the other
    aforementioned factors.

SG&A was $1.028 billion, or 27.5% of net sales, in
    2009 as compared with $1.108 billion, or 25.0% of net sales
    in 2008. Aside from acquisitions, SG&A was
    $142 million lower than 2008. The decrease in SG&A
    pertains to headcount reductions and various cost containment
    actions such as temporarily suspending certain
    U.S. retirement benefits in 2009 and sharply curtailing
    travel and other discretionary spending. There was also a
    reduction in variable selling and other costs, as well as
    favorable foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting
    these decreases was $22 million of increased spending to
    expand the convergent security business sales force and various
    brand awareness advertising campaigns, and $5 million for
    Black & Decker integration planning.

The corporate overhead element of SG&A, which is not
    allocated to the business segments, amounted to
    $245 million in 2010, $71 million in 2009 and
    $60 million in 2008. The previously discussed merger and
    acquisition-related charges, that unfavorably impacted corporate
    overhead, totaled $81 million in 2010 and $5 million
    in 2009. Corporate overhead, excluding merger and acquisition-
    related costs, represented 1.9%, 1.8% and 1.4% of net sales in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Distribution center costs (i.e. warehousing and fulfillment
    facility and associated labor costs) are classified within
    SG&A. This classification may differ from other companies
    who may report such expenses within cost of sales. Due to
    diversity in practice, to the extent the classification of these
    distribution costs differs from other companies, the
    Company’s gross margins may not be comparable. Such
    distribution costs classified in SG&A amounted to
    $198 million, $102 million and $122 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Other-net:

Other-net

from continuing operations totaled $200 million of expense
    in 2010 compared to $139 million of expense in 2009. The
    increase is primarily related to higher intangible asset
    amortization expense and $37 million of merger and
    acquisition-related charges inclusive of $20 million of
    defined benefit plan curtailment gains.

Other-net

from continuing operations amounted to $139 million of
    expense in 2009 compared to $112 million of expense in
    2008. The increase pertained primarily to higher intangible
    asset amortization expense, mainly associated with the 2008
    Sonitrol and GdP acquisitions. Additionally, the Company
    incurred $20 million in acquisition deal costs, primarily
    for Black & Decker, which are required to be expensed
    rather than capitalized in goodwill under new accounting rules
    that became effective in January 2009.

Gain on Debt Extinguishment:

In May 2009, the
    Company repurchased $103 million of its junior subordinated
    debt securities for $59 million in cash and recognized a
    $44 million pre-tax gain on extinguishment. In October
    2008, $34 million of these securities were repurchased for
    $25 million in cash resulting in a $9 million pre-tax
    gain thereon. In December 2010, the Company redeemed the
    remaining junior subordinated debt at par without penalty.

Interest, net:

Net interest expense from
    continuing operations in 2010 was $101 million, compared to
    $61 million in 2009 and $83 million in 2008. The
    increase in 2010 relates to higher long-term borrowing levels
    resulting primarily from the $1.832 billion debt acquired
    in connection with the Merger. The decrease in 2009 versus
    2008 net interest expense is primarily due to reduced
    short-term borrowing levels along with sharply lower applicable
    interest rates. Additionally, the favorable effects of

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swaps, coupled with the reduction in interest
    expense from early retirement of $137 million of junior
    subordinated debt securities, more than offset the increased
    interest expense from the September 2008 $250 million debt
    issuance.

Income Taxes:

The Company’s effective
    income tax rate from continuing operations was 16% in 2010
    compared to 19% in 2009 and 25% in 2008. During the second
    quarter 2010 the Company recorded a tax benefit of
    $36 million attributable to a favorable settlement of
    certain tax contingencies, due to a change in facts and
    circumstances that did not exist at the acquisition date related
    to the resolution of a legacy Black & Decker income
    tax audit. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2010 differs
    from the statutory rate primarily due to various non-deductible
    transactions and other restructuring associated with the Merger.
    The tax rate for 2010, excluding the impact of merger and
    acquisition-related charges as well as the tax settlement
    benefit, was 25%. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 primarily
    relates to benefits realized upon resolution of tax audits. The
    effective tax rate may vary in future periods based on the
    distribution of domestic and foreign earnings or changes in tax
    law in the jurisdictions the Company operates, among other
    factors.

Discontinued Operations:

The $3 million
    net loss from discontinued operations in 2009 is associated with
    the wind-down of one small divestiture and purchase price
    adjustments for CST/berger and the other small businesses
    divested in 2008. The $88 million of net earnings from
    discontinued operations in 2008 is attributable to the
    $84 million net gain from the sale of the CST/berger
    business along with three other small businesses divested in
    2008, and also reflects the operating results of these
    businesses through the dates of disposition.

Business
    Segment Results

The Company’s reportable segments are aggregations of
    businesses that have similar products, services and end markets,
    among other factors. The Company utilizes segment profit (which
    is defined as net sales minus cost of sales, and SG&A aside
    from corporate overhead expense), and segment profit as a
    percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each
    segment. Segment profit excludes the corporate overhead expense
    element of SG&A,

other-net

(inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense),
    restructuring and asset



impairments, interest income, interest expense, and income tax
    expense. Corporate overhead is comprised of world headquarters
    facility expense, cost for the executive management team and the
    expense pertaining to certain centralized functions that benefit
    the entire Company but are not directly attributable to the
    businesses, such as legal and corporate finance functions. Refer
    to Note O, Restructuring and Asset Impairments, and
    Note F, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, of the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of
    restructuring charges and asset impairments, and intangibles
    amortization expense, respectively, attributable to each
    segment. As discussed previously, the Company’s operations
    are classified into three business segments: CDIY, Security, and
    Industrial.

CDIY net sales from continuing operations increased
    $3.151 billion, or 243%, in 2010 compared with 2009.
    Black & Decker generated 241% of the increase.
    Favorable foreign currency translation contributed 1% to sales
    and price had a negative 1% impact. Segment unit volume
    increased over 2%, reflecting a 3% increase in the Americas and
    14% in Asia, which was partially offset by a 2% decline in
    Europe. Organic sales growth was aided by new product
    introductions including Bostitch hand tools and Stanley-branded
    storage units, and strength in Latin America. These factors more
    than offset sluggish market conditions in developed countries in
    North America, Western Europe and Australia. Additionally, CDIY
    further improved service levels (fill rates) over 2009. Pro
    forma Black & Decker sales increased 8% over 2009 with
    negative 1% price offset by 1% favorable currency translation.
    Black & Decker benefited from the successful global
    launch of the 12-volt compact lithium ion power tools marketed
    under the DeWalt, Porter Cable and Black & Decker
    brands, other new product introductions in home products, and
    strength in emerging markets. Segment profit increased
    $322 million and reflects $128 million of merger and
    acquisition-related charges comprised of inventory

step-up

amortization from the initial turn of the Black &
    Decker inventory and facility closure-related costs. Excluding
    the merger and acquisition-related charges, segment profit was
    $603 million, or 13.6% of sales. The expansion of the
    segment profit amount and rate, excluding merger and
    acquisition-related charges, was attributable to achievement of
    integration cost synergies, sales volume leverage and annual
    productivity initiatives. Negative inflation/ price arbitrage
    partially offset this profit rate expansion.

CDIY net sales from continuing operations decreased 22% in 2009
    from 2008. Customer pricing contributed 2% to sales which was
    more than offset by 3% of unfavorable foreign currency
    translation in all regions. Segment unit volumes declined 21%
    overall, comprised of 22% in both the Americas and Europe and
    16% in Asia. The sales volume declines were more pronounced in
    fastening systems (Bostitch), which has higher commercial
    construction and industrial channel content, than in consumer
    tools and storage. However the majority of this segment is
    driven by consumer and residential construction channels which
    were largely stabilized. Key customer point of sale data
    remained steady. Segment profit declined $37 million
    attributable to the sales volume pressure. The ongoing
    integration of the Bostitch business into consumer tools and
    storage generated efficiencies that significantly aided the
    segment profit rate recovery from a trough of 6.4% in the fourth
    quarter of 2008. The aforementioned Bostitch integration, along
    with other cost actions and productivity initiatives, as well as
    the carryover effect of price increases and lower commodity
    costs, enabled the 40 basis point improvement in the
    segment profit rate despite sharply lower sales.

Security segment sales from continuing operations increased 35%
    in 2010 reflecting a 29% contribution from the Merger and 8%
    from acquisitions, principally the March 2010 SSDS acquisition
    and the fourth quarter 2010 GMT Chinese hardware business.
    Modest price and favorable foreign currency translation provided
    a combined 1% sales benefit. Organic sales volume decreased 3%,
    and was more pronounced in mechanical access than in convergent
    security solutions. Mechanical access sales volume decline was
    associated with continued slow commercial construction markets
    and a large U.S. retailer’s inventory reduction that
    affected the hardware business. On a pro forma basis, the
    Black & Decker hardware and home improvement
    (“HHI”) business achieved 7% higher sales, with 6%
    unit volume growth, 2% favorable foreign currency translation
    and a 1% price decline. The HHI
    Kwikset

®

and
    Baldwin

®

new product introductions fueled the higher sales, overcoming
    the unfavorable impact of a residential hardware customer’s
    inventory destocking. Convergent security had a low single digit
    sales volume decrease as a solid performance by the healthcare
    solutions business was more than offset by weakness in
    commercial installations in the U.S. and U.K. security
    businesses. Segment profit reflects $43 million of merger
    and acquisition-related charges, comprised of facility
    closure-related costs and inventory

step-up

amortization from the initial turn of the Black &
    Decker inventory. Segment profit amounted to $349 million,
    or 16.5% of sales, aside from these costs. This 16.5% segment
    profit rate reflects 40 basis points of dilution from
    Black & Decker and acquired companies, such that
    legacy Stanley achieved a 16.9% segment profit rate excluding
    merger and acquisition-related charges. The increase in the
    total segment profit amount is attributable to Black &
    Decker and acquisitions which more than offset lower profits in
    the legacy Stanley business. The legacy Stanley performance
    pertained to lower absorption from reduced sales volume, due to
    weak construction markets and the previously mentioned customer
    inventory correction, along with inflation that pressured the
    segment profit rate. These factors more than offset the benefits
    fromproductivity improvements and restructuring actions with
    respect to legacy Stanley.

Security segment sales from continuing operations increased 4%
    in 2009 reflecting a 12% contribution from acquisitions, mainly
    Sonitrol (acquired in July 2008) and GdP (acquired in
    October 2008). Price provided a 2% sales benefit which was
    offset by nearly 2% of unfavorable foreign currency translation.
    Organic sales volume decreased 8% as the segment was affected by
    the contraction in U.S. commercial construction and other
    capital spending delays associated with weak economic
    conditions. Mechanical access had somewhat steeper volume
    declines than convergent security, but was aided by
    stabilization in the residential hardware markets and a hardware
    products roll-out at a major North American retailer in the
    second half of the year. Additionally, cross selling of
    mechanical products to convergent customers, retention of
    national account customers and select new product introductions
    helped alleviate mechanical access sales volume pressures. Lower
    organic volume in convergent (electronic) security pertained
    primarily to weakness in system installations, although there
    were some signs of improvement with national accounts late in
    the year. As a result there was a favorable mix shift in
    convergent security and the overall segment to higher margin
    recurring monthly service revenue (including security monitoring
    and maintenance) which grew organically in a high single digit
    percentage range. This improved sales mix shift in the segment
    was partially attributable to the recent expansion of the core
    commercial account sales force as well as a strategic emphasis
    on recurring service revenue and away from certain
    installation-only jobs. The increase in the segment profit
    amount was attributable to acquisitions, while the sustainment
    of organic profit at the prior year level is notable considering
    the headwinds from lower sales. The robust 180 basis point
    segment profit rate expansion was enabled by the ongoing
    successful integration of accretive acquisitions, the previously
    mentioned mix shift to higher margin recurring monthly service
    revenues, the benefits of customer pricing and proactive cost
    reductions.

Industrial segment net sales from continuing operations rose
    110% in 2010 compared with 2009. Black & Decker
    provided 77% of the sales increase and the CRC-Evans acquisition
    contributed 14%. Unfavorable foreign currency translation,
    driven by Europe, reduced sales by 2% while price provided a 1%
    increase in



sales. Sales unit volume gains were 21% primarily attributable
    to customer supply chain restocking, which subsided in the third
    quarter, market share gains, and strong end user demand fueled
    by higher global production levels and new product
    introductions. The Americas and Europe each posted robust 20%
    volume growth, and were outpaced by Asia. The industrial and
    automotive repair business enjoyed significant market share
    gains, end user market growth in all North American sales
    channels, particularly through industrial distribution. The
    hydraulic tools business also attained strong volume gains
    further aided by favorable steel scrap markets. On a pro forma
    basis, the Black & Decker engineered fastening
    business grew a substantial 30% associated with significantly
    higher automotive vehicle production in the Americas and Japan
    and increased customer penetration. The pro forma
    Black & Decker sales were comprised of 27% unit
    volume, negative 1% price, 1% favorable foreign currency
    translation and 3% from an acquisition. Merger and
    acquisition-related charges, primarily inventory

step-up

amortization from the initial turn of the Black &
    Decker and CRC-Evans inventories, amounted to $26 million
    in 2010. Excluding the merger and acquisition-related charges,
    segment profit was $269 million, or 14.5% of net sales,
    representing a robust 440 basis point expansion of the
    segment profit rate. This strong performance was enabled by the
    accretive impact of Black & Decker and CRC-Evans,
    along with favorable operating leverage and a reduced cost
    structure in the legacy Stanley businesses. Over one third of
    the segment profit rate improvement pertains to the legacy
    Stanley business and the remainder to the inclusion of
    Black & Decker and CRC-Evans.

Industrial segment net sales from continuing operations
    decreased 31% in 2009 compared with 2008. Price provided a 2%
    benefit which was offset by 2% of unfavorable foreign currency
    translation. Unit volume fell 31%, about evenly in the Americas
    and Europe which was partially offset by growth in the
    Company’s relatively less significant Asian region.
    Industrial channels were down more severely than automotive
    repair channels. The unit volume declines reflected ongoing
    severe economic weakness in the U.S. and Europe. In
    addition to broad-based, reduced end market demand, the segment
    was adversely impacted by pervasive inventory corrections
    throughout the supply chain which abated in the fourth quarter.
    There were signs of stabilization in the channels this business
    segment serves. Segment profit fell $75 million from the
    prior year due to the precipitous sales volume decline which was
    also reflected in the segment profit rate contraction. However,
    price realization partially mitigated the sales volume and
    related negative manufacturing productivity effects, along with
    a solid improvement in Mac Tools’ profit reflecting
    disciplined cost and other actions. The Company initiated
    extensive cost actions throughout the segment in late 2008, but
    they took longer to implement in Europe due to the
    country-specific works council process. Those actions were
    largely complete and were supplemented by other ongoing
    restructuring initiatives in 2009, as reflected in the quarterly
    segment profit rate that hit a trough of 9.2% in the third
    quarter and recovered to 11.3% in the fourth quarter.

2010 Actions:

During 2010, the Company
    recognized $224.3 million of restructuring charges and
    asset impairments associated with the Merger and acquisition of
    SSDS. Of those charges, $194.4 million relates to severance
    charges associated with the reduction of 3,000 employees,
    $20.2 million relates to asset impairments,
    $2.7 million relates to facility closure costs, and
    $7.0 million represents other charges.

In addition, the Company continued to initiate cost reduction
    actions in 2010 that were not associated with the Merger and
    SSDS acquisition, resulting in severance and related charges of
    $11.4 million pertaining to the reduction of approximately
    300 employees, and asset impairment charges of
    $3.8 million.

Of the $239.5 million recognized for these 2010 actions,
    $155.7 million has been utilized to date, with
    $84.4 million of reserves remaining as of January 1,
    2011, the majority of which are expected to be utilized in 2011.
    Usage includes $15.0 million the majority of which
    ultimately will entail cash payment in a future period as it
    relates to a defined benefit plan for severed Black &
    Decker executives which is classified in Accrued Pension and
    Post-Retirement Benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Pre-2010 Actions:

During 2009 and 2008 the
    Company initiated cost reduction actions in various businesses
    in response to sales volume declines associated with the
    economic recession. Charges recognized in 2010 associated with
    these initiatives amounted to $3.1 million.

As of January 2, 2010, the reserve balance related to these
    pre-2010 actions totaled $46.4 million. As a result of the
    Merger and the acquisition of SSDS, the Company has assumed
    $3.5 million of restructuring reserves recorded by those
    companies prior to the Merger and acquisition.

Utilization of the reserve balance related to Pre-2010 actions,
    including usage of those reserves acquired as part of the
    Merger, was $32.5 million in 2010. The remaining reserve
    balance of $16.8 million is expected to be utilized
    predominantly in 2011.

Segments:

The $242.6 million of charges
    recognized in 2010 includes: $126.4 million pertaining to
    the CDIY segment; $64.2 million pertaining to the Security
    segment; $12.2 million pertaining to the Industrial
    segment; and $39.8 million pertaining to non-operating
    entities.

In addition to the restructuring charges described in the
    preceding paragraphs, the Company recognized $21.4 million
    of restructuring-related costs in 2010 pertaining to the Merger.
    Those costs are classified in Cost of Sales and include
    accelerated depreciation and other charges associated with
    facility closures.



FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

Liquidity, Sources and Uses of
    Capital:

The Company’s primary sources
    of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and
    available lines of credit under various credit facilities.

Operating Activities:

In 2010, cash flow from
    operations was $739 million, a $200 million increase
    compared to $539 million in 2009. Cash flow from operations
    in 2010 was unfavorably impacted by approximately
    $382 million in payments for merger and acquisition-related
    items. Cash flows from operations improved in 2010 primarily due
    to an increase in various non-cash expenses associated with the
    Merger and the other 2010 acquisitions. Such expenses include,
    among other items, $174 million of inventory

step-up

amortization, a $41 million increase in intangible asset
    amortization, and a $108 million increase in other
    depreciation / amortization. Inflows from working
    capital (receivables, inventories and accounts payable) were
    $135 million in 2010, compared with inflows of
    $226 million in 2009. The change from 2009 is driven by
    higher receivables and inventory associated with improved 2010
    sales volume. Working capital turns improved to 5.7 times at
    January 1, 2011 as compared to 5.2 times for 2009 (pro
    forma with Black & Decker) due to improvements in days
    outstanding accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable,
    reflecting the process-driven improvements from the Stanley
    Fulfillment System (“SFS”). SFS principles continue to
    be deployed across all businesses and regions including the
    Black & Decker operations to improve its working
    capital efficiency over time. During 2010 the Company
    contributed $277 million to defined benefit retirement
    plans, as compared to $17 million in 2009; this includes
    $182 million in discretionary cash contributions to improve
    the funded status of legacy Black & Decker plans that
    are reflected in the merger and acquisition-related payments
    previously discussed.

In 2009, cash flow from operations totaled $539 million, up
    over $22 million compared to 2008. Working capital
    (receivables, inventories and accounts payable) generated
    $226 million of cash inflows, driven by inventory and
    accounts receivable reductions which were partially offset by
    lower accounts payable. These working capital reductions, while
    partially attributable to lower sales volumes, were engendered
    by broadly practiced SFS disciplines including effective sales
    and operations planning, a deliberate focus on reducing slow
    moving inventories, and vigilant receivable collections.
    Additionally, the Company implemented a receivable
    securitization facility in December 2009 which enabled a
    $35 million cash inflow. This strong working capital
    performance is apparent from the improvement in working capital
    turns from 5.9 in 2008 to a record 7.9 at year-end 2009. Cash
    outflows for restructuring activities totaled $58 million
    in 2009, an increase of $25 million over 2008, arising from
    the significant cost reduction actions initiated in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 as the Company
    right-sized its cost structure amidst sales pressures associated
    with weak macro-economic conditions.

Other non-cash operating cash flows represent items necessary to
    reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating
    activities. The other non-cash element of cash provided by
    operating activities is comprised of various items including
    non-cash gains on debt extinguishments (applicable in 2009
    only), inventory losses, interest accretion on the convertible
    notes, and loan cost amortization among other factors.

Free Cash Flow:

Free cash flow, as defined in
    the following table, was $554 million in 2010,
    $446 million in 2009, and $422 million in 2008,
    considerably exceeding net earnings. As previously discussed,
    2010 operating cash flow was affected by $382 million of
    merger-related payments. Management considers free cash flow an
    important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to
    fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners. In
    2008, free cash flow also excludes the income taxes paid on the
    CST/berger divestiture due to the fact the taxes are
    non-recurring and the directly related gross cash proceeds are
    classified in investing cash flows. Free cash flow does not
    include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing
    activity, discretionary dividends on the Company’s common
    stock and business acquisitions, among other items.

Based on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from
    operations as well as its strong balance sheet and credit
    position at January 1, 2011, the Company believes over the
    long term it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to
    its shareowners’ advantage through a combination of
    acquisitions, dividends, and potential future share repurchases.

Investing Activities:

Capital expenditures
    were $186 million in 2010, $93 million in 2009, and
    $141 million in 2008. The run rate for 2010 capital
    expenditures was slightly higher than the combined 2009 spend of
    Stanley and Black & Decker due to incremental capital
    and software expenditures associated with the Merger. The lower
    capital expenditures in 2009 compared to 2008 pertain to reduced
    capitalized software investments and the prior year purchase of
    a previously leased distribution facility that did not re-occur.
    The Company will continue to make capital investments that are
    necessary to drive productivity and cost structure improvements
    as well as achieve merger and acquisition-related cost synergies
    while ensuring that such investments deliver an appropriate
    risk-adjusted return on capital employed.

In 2010, aside from the Merger, the Company expended
    $547 million for ten acquisitions, mainly for CRC-Evans
    within the Industrial segment, and SSDS and GMT within the
    Security segment. Additionally the Company acquired
    $949 million of cash as part of the Merger. In 2009, the
    Company expended $24 million for several small
    acquisitions. In 2008, acquisition spending totaled
    $575 million, mainly for the GdP, Scan Modul, Sonitrol and
    Xmark businesses within the Security segment.

Investing cash flows in 2010, aside from the previously
    discussed capital expenditures and acquisition activity,
    primarily related to derivative settlements and terminations.
    The Company realized $30 million of cash proceeds from the
    termination of the Black & Decker interest rate swaps
    that had been entered into prior to the Merger, and became
    undesignated at the merger date. Additionally the Company had a
    net inflow on the settlement of net investment hedges of
    $15 million in 2010. Other investing cash flows were minor
    in 2009. Other investing cash flows in 2008 include
    $205 million in gross proceeds from sales of businesses,
    after transaction costs, primarily pertaining to the divestiture
    of the CST/berger laser measuring tool business in July 2008. As
    previously mentioned, the $46 million of income taxes paid
    on the gain are reported as an operating cash outflow and thus
    the total cash inflow from the 2008 divestitures amounts to
    $159 million.

Financing Activities:

Payments on long-term
    debt amounted to $516 million in 2010, $65 million in
    2009, and $45 million in 2008. The 2010 repayments
    primarily relate to the maturing of the $200 million term
    notes in March 2010 and the $313 million of payments
    associated with the remarketing of the Convertible Notes.

Net repayments of short-term borrowings totaled
    $264 million in 2010, $120 million in 2009 and
    $74 million in 2008.

On August 10, 2010, the Company received debt proceeds of
    $396.2 million relating to the $400 million in senior
    unsecured 2040 Term Bonds with a 5.2% fixed coupon rate. In
    connection with this debt offering the Company paid
    $48 million for the termination of two forward starting

floating-to-fixed

interest rate swaps.

On November 5, 2010, the Company completed a security
    offering of Convertible Preferred Units (the “Convertible
    Preferred Units”) which consisted of $632.5 million of
    eight-year junior subordinated notes (the “Notes”)
    bearing interest at an initial fixed rate of 4.25% per annum and
    $632.5 million of five-year forward Purchase Contracts (the
    “Purchase Contracts”) that obligate investors to
    purchase 6,325,0000 shares of the Company’s 4.75%
    Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Convertible
    Preferred Stock”) for a price of $100 per share on
    November 17, 2015. The Notes initially rank equal in right
    of payment with all of the Company’s other junior
    subordinated debt. With respect to the offering, in November
    2010 the Company received $613.5 million of cash proceeds,
    net of underwriting fees, and will not receive cash pertaining
    to the Purchase Contracts until November 2015. The cash proceeds
    of this offering received in November 2010 was used to redeem
    all of the Company’s outstanding 5.902% Fixed Rate/Floating
    Rate Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due 2045 of
    $312.7 million, to contribute $150.0 million to a
    U.S. pension plan to improve the funded status of the
    Company’s pension obligations, to fund the
    $50.3 million cost of the capped call transaction as more
    fully described below, and the remainder to reduce outstanding
    short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes.



The Notes are pledged and held as collateral to guarantee the
    Convertible Preferred Unit investors’ obligation to
    purchase the aforementioned Convertible Preferred Stock in
    November 2015 under the terms of the Purchase Contracts. In
    order to meet that obligation, investors may elect to
    participate in a remarketing in which the investor effectively
    sells the Note to another third party investor in order to
    generate cash proceeds sufficient to settle the Purchase
    Contract obligation. The remarketing may occur, at the option of
    the Company, as early as August 12, 2015, but no later than
    November 10, 2015. In conjunction with that remarketing the
    interest rate on the notes may be reset in order to generate
    sufficient proceeds to settle the investors’ purchase
    contract obligation. Additionally, upon remarketing, the notes
    will improve in ranking to be senior to all of the
    Company’s existing and future unsecured junior subordinated
    obligations and junior to all of the Company’s existing and
    future senior indebtedness.

The Convertible Preferred Stock deliverable upon settlement of
    the Purchase Contracts may be converted at a rate of 1.3333,
    which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately
    $75.00 per share of common stock or a 23% premium at the date of
    issuance. The Company may settle any conversion occurring on or
    after November 17, 2015 in cash, shares of the
    Company’s common stock, or a combination thereof. In the
    event that investors elect to settle Purchase Contracts prior to
    November 17, 2015, the company will be obligated to deliver
    shares of Convertible Preferred Stock equal to 85% of the number
    of Purchase Contracts tendered and if the Convertible Preferred
    Stock is converted prior to November 17, 2015 the Company
    will settle in shares of its common stock together with cash in
    lieu of fractional shares.

Prior to settlement and delivery of the Convertible Preferred
    Stock, the Purchase Contracts are not dilutive to earnings per
    share unless the average market price of the Company’s
    common stock during the period is above the conversion price of
    approximately $75.00 per share.

Simultaneous with the offering of the Convertible Preferred
    Units, the Company entered into capped call transactions (equity
    options) with counterparties. The total premium paid in 2010 for
    the capped call transactions was $50.3 million and was
    classified as a financing activity in the consolidated
    statements of cash flows. Each of the capped call transactions
    has a term of approximately five years and in aggregate the
    transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the
    maximum number of the Company’s common shares issuable upon
    settlement of the Convertible Preferred Stock. These
    transactions provide the Company the right to buy shares of its
    own common stock from the counterparties at a strike price of
    $75.00 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion
    price of the Convertible Preferred Stock, and also obligate the
    Company to sell shares of its own common stock to the
    counterparties at a strike price of $97.95. The capped call
    transactions may be settled by net share settlement or, at the
    Company’s option and subject to certain conditions, cash
    settlement, or physical settlement. The value received by the
    Company if the capped call transactions are exercised when the
    Company’s common stock price is above $75.00 can be
    utilized to offset the dilution that may occur should holders of
    the Convertible Preferred Stock elect to convert. Refer to
    Note H, Long Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, for
    further detail.

On September 29, 2008 the Company issued
    $250.0 million of unsecured Term Notes maturing
    October 1, 2013 (the “2013 Term Notes”) with
    fixed interest payable semi-annually, in arrears at a rate of
    6.15% per annum. The 2013 Term Notes rank equally with all of
    the Company’s existing and future unsecured and
    unsubordinated debt. The Company received net proceeds of
    $248.0 million which includes a discount of
    $0.5 million to achieve a 6.15% interest rate and
    $1.5 million of fees associated with the transaction. The
    proceeds were utilized to repay short-term borrowings.

In 2008, the Company utilized the proceeds from the
    $250 million of long-term debt issued in September 2008 as
    well as the $159 million in net proceeds from divestitures
    to repay short-term borrowings, which was partially offset by
    the cash outflows for business acquisitions and other matters.

On February 27, 2008, the Company amended its credit
    facility to provide for an increase and extension of its
    committed credit facility to $800 million from
    $550 million. In May 2008, the Company’s commercial
    paper program was also increased to $800 million. Following
    the merger the Company increased its committed credit facilities
    to $1.5 billion from $800 million. The credit
    facilities are diversified amongst twenty five financial
    institutions. The credit facilities are designated as a
    liquidity back-stop for the Company’s commercial paper
    program. The 5 year amended and restated facility expires
    in February 2013, the 364 days revolving credit



facility expires in March 2011. As of January 1, 2011,
    there were no outstanding loans under these facilities or any
    commercial paper outstanding.

The Company increased its cash dividend per common share to
    $1.34 in 2010. Dividends per common share increased 3.1% in
    2010, 3.2% in 2009, and 3.3% in 2008. In continuing its trend of
    dividend growth to its shareowners, the Company announced on
    February 15, 2011 that it will increase its quarterly
    dividend to $0.41 per common share which represents a 21%
    increase over 2010 quarterly dividend rates.

The Company repurchased $5 million of common stock in 2010.
    In 2009, the Company repurchased $3 million of common stock
    and in 2008, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of
    its common stock for $103 million (an average of $46.11 per
    share). Proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled
    $396 million in 2010, $61 million in 2009 and
    $19 million in 2008. The Company received $320 million
    of cash proceeds in May, 2010 from the forward stock purchase
    contracts element of the Equity Units. The remaining amounts in
    each year mainly relate to employee and retiree stock option
    exercises.

Credit Ratings and Liquidity:

The Company has
    strong investment grade credit ratings from all major
    U.S. rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt (average
    A-) as well as its short-term commercial paper borrowings. While
    the ratings from certain agencies were unfavorably changed
    following the Merger, the current credit ratings are investment
    grade and the Company continues to have full access to credit
    markets. Based on its current standing and historically strong
    cash flows from operations which are expected to further improve
    in 2011 and future years, as the cash outflows pertaining to
    restructuring and Merger integration actions subside among other
    positive factors, the Company expects it will continue to have
    strong investment grade credit ratings. As detailed in
    Note H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, the
    Company has $3.434 billion of debt, including
    $416 million of current maturities, and $1.6 million
    of short-term borrowings at January 1, 2011; the debt has
    well-staggered maturities over many years. Cash and cash
    equivalents total $1.745 billion at January 1, 2011.
    Concurrent with the Merger, the Company has made a determination
    to repatriate $1.636 billion (an estimated
    $1.193 billion after taxes) of legacy Black &
    Decker foreign earnings in the future. Management believes the
    Company has ample liquidity and a healthy capital structure for
    both the near and long-term. Failure to maintain strong
    investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the
    Company’s cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital
    markets, but would not have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s ability to access the $1.5 billion committed
    credit facilities.

MARKET
    RISK

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from
    adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments,
    currencies, commodities and other items traded in global
    markets. The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices,
    and commodity prices. Exposure to foreign currency risk results
    because the Company, through its global businesses, enters into
    transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple
    currencies. The Company’s predominant exposures are in
    European, Canadian, British, Australian, and Asian currencies,
    including the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) and the Taiwan
    Dollar. Certain cross-currency trade flows arising from sales
    and procurement activities as well as affiliate cross-border
    activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk
    protection through the use of various derivative financial
    instruments which may include: purchased basket options;
    purchased options; and currency forwards. The Company is thus
    able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage
    of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to
    reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection. At times,
    the Company also enters into forward exchange contracts and
    purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of
    non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables,
    predominately for affiliate transactions. Gains and losses from
    these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the
    underlying net exposures, assets and liabilities being hedged.
    Management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging
    activities, and in certain cases, may elect to allow certain
    currency exposures to remain un-hedged. The Company has also
    entered into cross-currency swaps and forward contracts, to
    provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain
    subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to
    debt service requirements. Management estimates the foreign
    currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of
    2010 would have been approximately a $62 million pre-tax
    loss based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all net
    derivative currency positions; this effect would occur from
    depreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the
    U.S. dollar. The Company follows risk management policies
    in executing derivative financial instrument transactions, and
    does not use such instruments for speculative purposes. The
    Company does not hedge the translation of its

non-U.S. dollar

earnings in foreign subsidiaries.



As mentioned above, the Company routinely has cross-border trade
    and affiliate flows that cause a “transactional”
    impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. The
    Company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from
    the translation of foreign earnings into U.S. dollars, as
    previously discussed. It is more difficult to quantify the
    transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the
    translational effects. Aside from the use of derivative
    instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure,
    transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions
    the Company may take; for example, if an exposure occurs from a
    European entity sourcing product from a U.S. supplier it
    may be possible to change to a European supplier. Management
    estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of
    a 10% overall movement in exchange rates is approximately
    $81 million, or $0.47 per diluted share. With respect to
    transactional foreign currency market risk, the Company sources
    significant products from China and other Asian low cost
    countries for resale in other regions. To the extent the Chinese
    RMB or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the
    U.S. dollar, the Company may experience cost increases on
    such purchases which could adversely impact profitability. In
    the event significant RMB or other currency appreciation occurs,
    the Company would initiate customer pricing or other actions in
    an effort to mitigate the related cost increases, but it is
    possible such actions would not fully offset the potential
    unfavorable impact. Based on current exchange rates, management
    does not anticipate that foreign exchange will have a
    significant impact on 2011 results. Additionally, management has
    allowed for an approximately 3% appreciation of the RMB relative
    to the U.S. dollar in providing 2011 earnings guidance as
    discussed in the 2011 Outlook section of this MD&A.

The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from
    its outstanding debt obligations, short-term investments, and
    derivative financial instruments employed in the management of
    its debt portfolio. The debt portfolio including both trade and
    affiliate debt, is managed to achieve capital structure targets
    and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination
    of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps,
    and cross-currency swaps.

The Company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes
    from its floating rate debt in the U.S. and Europe and is
    fairly represented by changes in LIBOR and EURIBOR rates. At
    January 1, 2011, the impact of a hypothetical 10% increase
    in the interest rates associated with the Company’s
    floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an
    immaterial effect on the Company’s financial position and
    results of operations.

The Company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses,
    particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc,
    steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods.
    Generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with
    derivative financial instruments, but instead are actively
    managed through customer product and service pricing actions,
    procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives and other
    productivity improvement projects. The Company experienced
    inflation (primarily commodity and freight) of approximately
    $70 million and $140 million in 2010 and 2008,
    respectively, while it experienced mild deflation in 2009.
    Cumulatively, during 2008 — 2010 the Company recovered
    more than two thirds of inflation through customer pricing.
    However, price erosion occurred in 2010 and the net unfavorable
    price / inflation impact for 2010 was over
    $120 million. Management estimates inflation in 2011 will
    adversely impact profits by 100 basis points, inclusive of
    approximately 3% Chinese RMB currency appreciation effect.
    Commodity and sourced product costs may increase in the future,
    and in that event there would be an unfavorable impact on
    earnings to the extent not recovered through customer pricing
    and other cost reduction actions.

Fluctuations in the fair value of the Company’s common
    stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in
    the ESOP section of MD&A. Additionally, the Company has
    $23 million of liabilities as of January 1, 2011
    pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain
    U.S. employees for which there is

mark-to-market

exposure.

The assets held by the Company’s defined benefit plans are
    exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities,
    primarily global stocks and fixed-income securities. The funding
    obligations for these plans would increase in the event of
    adverse changes in the plan asset values, although such funding
    would occur over a period of many years. In 2010 and 2009, there
    were $138 million and $48 million in investment
    returns on pension plan assets, respectively, compared with a
    $71 million loss on plan assets in 2008 due to volatile
    financial markets. The Company expects funding obligations on
    its defined benefit plans to be approximately $140 million
    in 2011. The Company employs diversified asset allocations to
    help mitigate this risk.



Management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and
    terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate.

The Company has access to financial resources and borrowing
    capabilities around the world. There are no instruments within
    the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements
    due to a change in credit rating.

The Company’s existing credit facilities and sources of
    liquidity, including operating cash flows, are considered more
    than adequate to conduct business as normal. Accordingly, based
    on present conditions and past history, management believes it
    is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any
    potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may
    occur. The Company believes that its strong financial position,
    operating cash flows, committed long-term credit facilities and
    borrowing capacity, and ready access to equity markets provide
    the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of
    annual dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its
    businesses, to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other
    initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its
    strong investment grade credit ratings.

OTHER
    MATTERS

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

As detailed in
    Note L, Employee Benefit Plans, of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has an Employee
    Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) under which the ongoing
    U.S. Cornerstone and 401(K) defined contribution plans are
    funded. Overall ESOP expense is affected by the market value of
    the Company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are
    released, among other factors. Net ESOP activity amounted to
    expense of $3 million in 2010, and $8 million of
    income and $11 million of expense in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The ESOP income in 2009 stems from the suspension
    of the Cornerstone benefits and the reduction of the 401(K)
    match, as a percentage of employee contributions, as part of
    cost saving actions. The Company reinstated these benefits for
    2010 and as a result, there was an increase in expense in 2010
    more aligned with 2008 and prior years. ESOP expense could
    increase in the future if the market value of the Company’s
    common stock declines.

CUSTOMER-RELATED RISKS —

The Company has
    significant customers, particularly home centers and major
    retailers, though individually there are none that exceed 10% of
    consolidated sales. The loss or material reduction of business
    from any such significant customer could have a material adverse
    impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash
    flows, until either such customers were replaced or the Company
    made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of
    business.

There are no individually material credit exposures from
    particular customers. While the Company has strong credit
    policies and disciplined management of receivables, due to weak
    economic conditions or other factors it is reasonably possible
    that certain customers’ creditworthiness may decline and
    losses from receivable write-offs may increase.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS —

Refer to
    Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new
    accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial
    position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES —

Preparation of
    the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
    Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note A,
    Significant Accounting Policies. Management believes the most
    complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from
    the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with
    inherent uncertainty. The most significant areas involving
    management estimates are described below. Actual results in
    these areas could differ from management’s estimates.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS —  The Company’s
    estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to
    trade receivables is based on two methods. The amounts
    calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine
    the total amount reserved. First, a specific reserve is
    established for individual accounts where information indicates
    the customers may have an inability to meet financial



obligations. In these cases, management uses its judgment, based
    on the surrounding facts and circumstances, to record a specific
    reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the
    receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These
    specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional
    information is received. Second, a reserve is determined for all
    customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable
    aging categories. These percentages are based on historical
    collection and write-off experience.

If circumstances change, for example, due to the occurrence of
    higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in
    a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation
    to the Company, estimates of the recoverability of receivable
    amounts due could be reduced.

INVENTORIES — LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, SLOW MOVING AND
    OBSOLETE —  Inventories in the U.S. are
    predominantly valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market, while

non-U.S. inventories

are valued at the lower of FIFO cost or market. The calculation
    of LIFO reserves, and therefore the net inventory valuation, is
    affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components. The
    Company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or
    market, and continually reviews the carrying value of
    discontinued product lines and stock-keeping-units
    (“SKUs”) to determine that these items are properly
    valued. The Company also continually evaluates the composition
    of its inventory and identifies obsolete

and/or

slow-moving inventories. Inventory items identified as obsolete

and/or

slow-moving are evaluated to determine if write-downs are
    required. The Company assesses the ability to dispose of these
    inventories at a price greater than cost. If it is determined
    that cost is less than market value, cost is used for inventory
    valuation. If market value is less than cost, the Company writes
    down the related inventory to that value. If a write down to the
    current market value is necessary, the market value cannot be
    greater than the net realizable value, or ceiling (defined as
    selling price less costs to sell and dispose), and cannot be
    lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin,
    also called the floor. If the Company is not able to achieve its
    expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its
    current value, further write-downs would be recorded.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT — The Company generally
    values Property, Plant and Equipment (“PP&E”) at
    historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Impairment losses
    are recorded when indicators of impairment, such as plant
    closures, are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
    to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying
    amount. The impairment loss is quantified by comparing the
    carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted
    cash flows, which consider various possible outcomes for the
    disposition of the assets (i.e. sale, leasing, etc.). Primarily
    as a result of plant rationalization, certain facilities and
    equipment are not currently used in operations. The Company
    recorded $24 million in asset impairment losses in 2010
    primarily as a result of restructuring initiatives, and such
    losses may occur in the future.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS — The Company acquires
    businesses in purchase transactions that result in the
    recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets. The
    determination of the value of intangible assets requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with
    Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)

350-20

“Goodwill” acquired goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to
    impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or
    circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an
    impairment exists. Other intangible assets are amortized and are
    tested for impairment when appropriate. The Company completed
    the Merger and acquisitions in 2010 and 2009 valued at
    $5.2 billion and $24 million, respectively. The assets
    and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at fair
    value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in
    excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of
    acquired businesses. The Company reported $5.942 billion of
    goodwill and $1.652 billion of indefinite-lived trade names
    at January 1, 2011.

In accordance with

ASC 350-20,

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit
    level. A reporting unit is a reportable operating segment as
    defined in ASC 280, “Segment Reporting,” or one
    level below a reportable operating segment (component level) as
    determined by the availability of discrete financial information
    that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an
    aggregate of component levels of a reportable operating segment
    having similar economic characteristics. As a result of
    organization structure simplification effective in the beginning
    of fiscal 2010, the Company modified the number of reporting
    units from seven (pre-merger) to six. If the carrying value of a
    reporting unit (including the value of goodwill) is



greater than its fair value, an impairment may exist. An
    impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the
    recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value.

The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units based
    on a discounted cash flow valuation model. The key assumptions
    used are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to
    cash flow projections. Also inherent in the discounted cash flow
    valuation are near-term revenue growth rates over the next five
    years. These assumptions contemplate business, market and
    overall economic conditions. The fair value of indefinite-lived
    trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow
    valuation model. The key assumptions used include discount
    rates, royalty rates, and perpetual growth rates applied to the
    projected sales.

As required by the Company’s policy, goodwill and
    indefinite-lived trade names were tested for impairment in the
    third quarter of 2010. Based on this testing, the Company
    determined that the fair value of its reporting units and
    indefinite-lived trade names exceeded their carrying values. The
    discount rate used in testing goodwill for impairment in the
    third quarter of 2010 was 9.5% for all reporting units. The
    near-term revenue growth rates and the perpetual growth rates,
    which varied for each reporting unit, ranged from -4% to 8%, and
    2% to 4%, respectively. In 2010 as compared with 2009, in
    consideration of market conditions, the discount rate assumption
    decreased 100 basis points, and perpetual growth rates
    decreased 100 basis points in some reporting units, which
    had the effect of reducing the estimated fair values. Management
    performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from
    the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative
    assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the
    discount rate, perpetual and near-term revenue growth rates in
    all reporting units. The discount rate was decreased by
    100 basis points with no impairment indicated. The
    perpetual growth rates were decreased by 100 basis points
    with no impairment indicated. The near-term revenue growth rates
    were reduced by 150 basis points with no impairment
    indicated. Based upon the Company’s 2010 annual impairment
    testing analysis, including the consideration of reasonably
    likely adverse changes in assumptions described above,
    management believes it is not reasonably likely that an
    impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the
    next twelve months.

In the event that the Company’s operating results in the
    future do not meet current expectations, management, based upon
    conditions at the time, would consider taking restructuring or
    other actions as necessary to maximize profitability.
    Accordingly, the above sensitivity analysis, while a useful
    tool, should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment. A
    thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at
    that time would need to be performed to determine if recording
    an impairment loss was appropriate.

DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS — The valuation of pension
    and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is
    dependent on various assumptions. These assumptions, which are
    updated annually, include discount rates, expected return on
    plan assets, future salary increase rates, and health care cost
    trend rates. The Company considers current market conditions,
    including interest rates, to establish these assumptions.
    Discount rates are developed considering the yields available on
    high-quality fixed income investments with maturities
    corresponding to the duration of the related benefit
    obligations. The Company’s weighted-average discount rate
    for both the United States and international pension plans was
    5.25% and 5.75% at January 1, 2011 and January 3,
    2010, respectively. As discussed further in Note L,
    Employee Benefit Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, the Company develops the expected return on plan
    assets considering various factors, which include its targeted
    asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected
    future returns. For 2010 net periodic benefit cost the
    Company’s long-term rate of return assumption was 7.5% and
    6.75% for United States and international plans, respectively.
    The Company will use a 7% expected rate of return assumption for
    2011 net periodic benefit cost reflecting a relatively
    higher proportion of fixed income plan assets.

The Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate;
    however, differences in actual experience or changes in the
    assumptions may materially affect the Company’s financial
    position or results of operations. To the extent that actual
    (newly measured) results differ from the actuarial assumptions,
    the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, and, if in excess of a specified corridor, amortized
    over future periods. The expected return on plan assets is
    determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value
    of plan assets. Accordingly, market fluctuations in the fair
    value of plan assets can affect the net



periodic benefit cost in the following year. The projected
    benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair
    value of plan assets by $713 million at January 1,
    2011. The Merger resulted in a significant increase in defined
    benefit plan obligations and related expense. The primary
    Black & Decker U.S pension and post employment benefit
    plans were curtailed in late 2010, as well as the only material
    Black & Decker international plan, and the Company
    implemented defined contribution benefit plans. As of
    January 1, 2011, 83% of the projected benefit obligation
    pertains to plans that have been frozen; the remaining defined
    benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small
    domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in
    certain international jurisdictions. The Company recognized
    $39 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2010,
    inclusive of $20 million in net curtailment/ settlement
    gains; management expects the expense for these plans will
    decrease by approximately $10 million in 2011.

ENVIRONMENTAL —  The Company incurs costs related to
    environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations
    governing current operations as well as the remediation of
    previously contaminated sites. Future laws and regulations are
    expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase
    the Company’s expenditures related to routine environmental
    matters.

The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental
    investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability
    recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts
    with respect to each individual site and includes such factors
    as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations,
    and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The
    liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for
    recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and
    remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded
    are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
    technical and legal information that becomes available.

As of January 1, 2011, the Company had reserves of
    $173 million for remediation activities associated with
    Company-owned properties as well as for Superfund sites, for
    losses that are probable and estimable. The Merger resulted in a
    significant increase in environmental reserves and related
    expense. The range of environmental remediation costs that is
    reasonably possible is $157 million to $349 million
    which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be
    liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns.
    Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with
    this policy.

INCOME TAXES —  Income taxes are accounted for in
    accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, which
    requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized,
    using enacted tax rates, for the effect of temporary differences
    between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and
    liabilities. Deferred tax assets, including net operating
    losses, are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is

“more likely than not”

that some portion or all
    of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company
    estimates future taxable income, considering the feasibility of
    ongoing tax planning strategies, the realizability of tax loss
    carry-forwards and the future reversal of existing temporary
    differences. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets
    can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax
    rates and future taxable income levels. In the event the Company
    were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a
    portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the
    unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period
    in which that determination is made. By contrast, if the Company
    were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax
    assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it
    would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a
    favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that
    determination is made.

The company is subject to tax in a number of locations,
    including many state and foreign jurisdictions. Significant
    judgment is required when calculating our worldwide provision
    for income taxes. We consider many factors when evaluating and
    estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require
    periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate
    actual outcomes. It is reasonably possible that the amount of
    the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of our
    unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or
    decrease within the next 12 months. These changes may be
    the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in
    transfer pricing matters. The Company periodically assesses its
    liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under
    audit based on the most current available information, which
    involves inherent



uncertainty. For those tax positions where it is more likely
    than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded
    the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50%
    likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a
    taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
    information. For those income tax positions where it is not more
    likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax
    benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The
    Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with
    uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note Q, Income
    Taxes, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further discussion.

RISK INSURANCE —  To manage its insurance costs
    efficiently, the Company self insures for certain
    U.S. business exposures and generally has low deductible
    plans internationally. For domestic workers’ compensation,
    automobile and product liability (liability for alleged injuries
    associated with the Company’s products), the Company
    generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe
    losses (“stop loss” insurance) and these lines of
    insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates.
    While different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these
    lines of insurance, the maximum stop loss deductible is set at
    no more than $5 million per occurrence and $49 million
    in the aggregate per annum. The process of establishing risk
    insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial
    valuations that reflect the Company’s specific loss
    history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among
    statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves
    required. Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific
    reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected
    for development of these claims, as well as for incurred but not
    yet reported claims discounted to present value. The cash
    outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur
    over a maximum of 13 years. The Company believes the
    liabilities recorded for these U.S. risk insurance
    reserves, totaling $106 million and $42 million as of
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, respectively, are
    adequate. The Merger resulted in a significant increase in
    U.S. risk insurance reserves and related expense. Due to
    judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is
    possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate.

WARRANTY — The Company provides product and service
    warranties which vary across its businesses. The types of
    warranties offered generally range from one year to limited
    lifetime, while certain products carry no warranty. Further, the
    Company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its
    products in connection with product performance issues.
    Historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis
    for warranty obligations recognized. Adjustments are recorded to
    the warranty liability as new information becomes available. The
    Company believes the $120 million and $67 million
    reserves for expected warranty claims as of January 1, 2011
    and January 2, 2010, respectively, is adequate, but due to
    judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process, including
    forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of
    repair as well as the estimated age of certain products
    submitted for claims, the ultimate claim costs may differ from
    the recorded warranty liability. The Merger resulted in a
    significant increase in warranty reserves and related expense.
    The Company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a
    product-specific basis during the period in which the
    circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and
    estimable for both company initiated actions and those required
    by regulatory bodies.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENT

SYNTHETIC LEASES — The Company is a party to synthetic
    leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and
    certain U.S. personal property, predominately vehicles and
    equipment. The programs qualify as operating leases for
    accounting purposes, such that only the monthly rent expense is
    recorded in the Statement of Operations and the liability and
    value of the underlying assets are off-balance sheet.

These lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall
    cost and to retain flexibility. The cash outflows for lease
    payments approximate the $9 million of rent expense
    recognized in fiscal 2010. As of January 1, 2011, the
    estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for
    these properties were $41 million and $35 million,
    respectively.

    acquisition related charges, in the range of $4.75 to $5.00 per
    diluted share (collectively, the “Results”); are
    “forward looking statements” and subject to risk and
    uncertainty.

These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future
    performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and
    assumptions that are difficult to predict. There are a number of
    risks, uncertainties and important factors that could cause
    actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such
    forward-looking statements. In addition to any such risks,
    uncertainties and other factors discussed elsewhere herein, the
    risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause or
    contribute to actual results differing materially from those
    expressed or implied in the forward looking statements include,
    without limitation, those set forth under Item 1A Risk
    Factors hereto and any material changes thereto set forth in any
    subsequent Quarterly Reports on

Form 10-Q,

the Company’s other filings with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission, and those set forth below.

The Company’s ability to deliver the Results is dependent,
    or based, upon: (i) the Company’s ability to
    effectively execute its integration plans to identify and
    estimate key synergy drivers; achieve the cost and revenue
    synergies, capitalize on growth opportunities and achieve the
    anticipated results of the Merger; (ii) the Company’s
    success in driving brand expansion, achieving increased access
    to global markets through established distribution channels and
    cross selling opportunities; (iii) the ability of the
    Company to generate organic net sales increase of 5-6%, from a
    combined Company pro-forma level of $9.3 billion;
    (iv) the Company’s ability to achieve revenue synergy
    increase of 50 bps to 2011 revenues with modest EPS impact;
    (v) the Company achieving operating margin rate expansion
    of approximately 150 bps versus 2010; (vi) achieving a
    tax rate of approximately 25% — 26%;
    (vii) non-merger and acquisition related restructuring,
    impairment and related charges remaining relatively flat to
    those in 2010; (viii) the Company’s success at
    limiting the cost to achieve cost synergies to $200 million
    over the next two years; (ix) the Company’s ability to
    limit costs associated with severance and facilities closures to
    $90 million in 2011; (x) one-time costs to be recorded
    in SG&A and

“other-net”

being $15 million for certain compensation charges,
    advisory and consulting fees; (xi) almost no impact from
    price and inflation based on no significant increase in
    commodity levels; (xii) successful identification,
    consummation and of acquisitions, as well as integration of
    existing businesses, that enhance the Company’s growth and
    long term objectives; (xiii) the continued acceptance of
    technologies used in the Company’s products and services;
    (xiv) the Company’s ability to manage existing
    Sonitrol franchisee and Mac Tools distributor relationships;
    (xv) the Company’s ability to minimize costs
    associated with any sale or discontinuance of a business or
    product line, including any severance, restructuring, legal or
    other costs; (xvi) the proceeds realized with respect to
    any business or product line disposals; (xvii) the extent
    of any asset impairments with respect to any businesses or
    product lines that are sold or discontinued as well as the
    Company’s ability to test and analyze the possibility of
    asset impairment; (xviii) the success of the



Company’s efforts to manage freight costs, steel and other
    commodity costs; (xix) the Company’s ability to
    sustain or increase prices in order to, among other things,
    offset or mitigate the impact of steel, freight, energy,
    non-ferrous commodity and other commodity costs and any
    inflation increases; (xx) the Company’s ability to
    generate free cash flow and maintain a strong debt to capital
    ratio; (xxi) the Company’s ability to identify and
    effectively execute productivity improvements and cost
    reductions, while minimizing any associated restructuring
    charges; (xxii) the Company’s ability to obtain
    favorable settlement of routine tax audits; (xxiii) the
    ability of the Company to generate earnings sufficient to
    realize future income tax benefits during periods when temporary
    differences become deductible; (xxiv) the continued ability
    of the Company to access credit and equity markets under
    satisfactory terms; and (xxv) the Company’s ability to
    negotiate satisfactory payment terms under which the Company
    buys and sells goods, services, materials and products.

The Company’s ability to deliver the Results is also
    dependent upon: (i) the success of the Company’s
    marketing and sales efforts; (ii) the ability of the
    Company to maintain or improve production rates in the
    Company’s manufacturing facilities, respond to significant
    changes in product demand and fulfill demand for new and
    existing products; (iii) the Company’s ability to
    continue improvements in working capital through effective
    management of accounts receivable and inventory levels;
    (iv) the ability to continue successfully managing and
    defending claims and litigation, including environmental claims
    and expenses; (v) the success of the Company’s efforts
    to mitigate any cost increases generated by, for example,
    increases in the cost of energy or significant Chinese Renminbi
    or other currency appreciation; (vi) the geographic
    distribution of the Company’s earnings; (vii) the
    Company’s investment of revenues in infrastructure
    improvements; (viii) the commitment to and success of the
    Stanley Fulfillment System.

The Company’s ability to achieve the Results will also be
    affected by external factors. These external factors include:
    pricing pressure and other changes within competitive markets;
    the continued consolidation of customers particularly in
    consumer channels; inventory management pressures on the
    Company’s customers; the impact the tightened credit
    markets may have on the Company or its customers or suppliers;
    the extent to which the Company has to write off accounts
    receivable or assets or experiences supply chain disruptions in
    connection with bankruptcy filings by customers or suppliers;
    increasing competition; changes in laws, regulations and
    policies that affect the Company, including, but not limited to
    trade, monetary, tax and fiscal policies and laws; the timing
    and extent of any inflation or deflation; currency exchange
    fluctuations; the impact of dollar/foreign currency exchange and
    interest rates on the competitiveness of products and the
    Company’s debt program; the strength of the U.S. and
    European economies; the extent to which world-wide markets
    associated with homebuilding and remodeling stabilize and
    rebound; the impact of events that cause or may cause disruption
    in the Company’s manufacturing, distribution and sales
    networks such as war, terrorist activities, and political
    unrest; and recessionary or expansive trends in the economies of
    the world in which the Company operates, including, but not
    limited to, the extent and duration of the current recession in
    the US economy and fluctuations in the securities markets.

Unless required by applicable federal securities laws, the
    Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise
    any forward looking statements to reflect events or
    circumstances that may arise after the date hereof. Investors
    are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures made on
    related subjects in the Company’s reports filed with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission.

In addition to the foregoing, some of the agreements included as
    exhibits to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(whether incorporated by reference to earlier filings or
    otherwise) may contain representations and warranties, recitals
    or other statements that appear to be statements of fact. These
    agreements are included solely to provide investors with
    information regarding their terms and are not intended to
    provide any other factual or disclosure information about the
    Company or the other parties to the agreements. Representations
    and warranties, recitals, and other common disclosure provisions
    have been included in the agreements solely for the benefit of
    the other parties to the applicable agreements and often are
    used as a means of allocating risk among the parties.

Accordingly, such statements (i) should not be treated as
    categorical statements of fact; (ii) may be qualified by
    disclosures that were made to the other parties in connection
    with the negotiation of the applicable agreements, which
    disclosures are not necessarily reflected in the agreement or
    included as exhibits hereto;



(iii) may apply standards of materiality in a way that is
    different from what may be viewed as material by or to investors
    in or lenders to the Company; and (iv) were made only as of
    the date of the applicable agreement or such other date or dates
    as may be specified in the agreement and are subject to more
    recent developments. Accordingly, representations and
    warranties, recitals or other disclosures contained in
    agreements may not describe the actual state of affairs as of
    the date they were made or at any other time and should not be
    relied on by any person other than the parties thereto in
    accordance with their terms. Additional information about the
    Company may be found in this Annual Report on

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

The management of Stanley Black & Decker (the
    “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of January 1,
    2011. In making its assessment, management has utilized the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Management concluded
    that based on its assessment, the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    January 1, 2011. Ernst & Young LLP, the auditor
    of the financial statements included in this annual report, has
    issued an attestation report on the registrant’s internal
    control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on
    page 56.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including the Company’s President and Chief Executive
    Officer and its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
    Officer, the Company has, pursuant to

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), evaluated the effectiveness of the
    design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures
    (as defined under

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the
    Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and its
    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
    that, as of January 1, 2011, the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures are effective. There has been no change
    in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    that occurred during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2011
    that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
    purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed
    the effectiveness of Stanley Black & Decker
    Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    January 1, 2011. In making its assessment, management has
    utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Management
    concluded that based on its assessment, Stanley
    Black & Decker, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of January 1, 2011.
    Ernst & Young LLP, the auditor of the financial
    statements included in this annual report, has issued an
    attestation report on the registrant’s internal control
    over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on
    page 49.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stanley
    Black & Decker, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of January 1, 2011 and
    January 2, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, changes in shareowners’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
    January 1, 2011. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of the Company at January 1, 2011 and
    January 2, 2010, and the consolidated results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal
    years in the period ended January 1, 2011, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Statement No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(codified in ASC 805,

Business Combinations

),
    effective for the Company on January 4, 2009.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    January 1, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stanley
    Black & Decker, Inc.

We have audited Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. and
    subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control
    over financial reporting as of January 1, 2011, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of January 1, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 1,
    2011 and January 2, 2010, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, changes in shareowners’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
    ended January 1, 2011 and our report dated
    February 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

A.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION —

On March 12, 2010
    a wholly owned subsidiary of The Stanley Works was merged with
    and into The Black & Decker Corporation
    (“Black & Decker”), with the result that
    Black & Decker became a wholly owned subsidiary of The
    Stanley Works (the “Merger”). In connection with the
    Merger, The Stanley Works changed its name to Stanley
    Black & Decker, Inc. The results of the operations and
    cash flows of Black & Decker have been included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements from the time
    of the consummation of the Merger on March 12, 2010 (see
    Note E, Merger and Acquisitions).

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. and its majority-owned
    subsidiaries (collectively the “Company”) which
    require consolidation, after the elimination of intercompany
    accounts and transactions. The Company’s fiscal year ends
    on the Saturday nearest to December 31. There were 52, 52
    and 53 weeks in the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
    revenues and expenses, as well as certain financial statement
    disclosures. While management believes that the estimates and
    assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements
    are appropriate, actual results could differ from these
    estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY —

For foreign operations with
    functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and
    liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates;
    income and expenses are translated using weighted-average
    exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reported in a
    separate component of shareowners’ equity and exchange
    gains and losses on transactions are included in earnings.

CASH EQUIVALENTS —

Highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less are considered
    cash equivalents.

ACCOUNTS AND FINANCING RECEIVABLE —

Trade
    receivables are stated at gross invoice amount less discounts,
    other allowances and provision for uncollectible accounts and
    financing receivables are initially recorded at fair value, less
    impairments or provisions for credit losses. Interest income
    earned from financing receivables that are not delinquent is
    recorded on the effective interest method. The Company considers
    any financing receivable that has not been collected within
    90 days of original billing date as past-due or delinquent.
    Additionally, the Company considers the credit quality of all
    past-due or delinquent financing receivables as nonperforming.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS —

The Company
    estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts using two methods.
    First, a specific reserve is established for individual accounts
    where information indicates the customers may have an inability
    to meet financial obligations. Second, a reserve is determined
    for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to
    aging categories. These percentages are based on historical
    collection and write-off experience. Actual write-offs are
    charged against the allowance when collection efforts have been
    unsuccessful.

INVENTORIES —

U.S inventories are predominantly
    valued at the lower of

Last-In

First-Out (“LIFO”) cost or market because the Company
    believes it results in better matching of costs and revenues.
    Other inventories are valued at the lower of

First-In,

First-Out (“FIFO”) cost or market because LIFO is not
    permitted for statutory reporting outside the U.S. See
    Note C, Inventory, for a quantification of the LIFO impact
    on inventory valuation.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT —

The Company
    generally values property, plant and equipment
    (“PP&E”), including capitalized software, on the
    basis of historical cost less accumulated depreciation and
    amortization. Costs related to maintenance and repairs which do
    not prolong the assets’ useful lives are



expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided
    using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of
    the assets as follows:

Useful Life

(Years)

Land improvements

10 – 20

Buildings


Machinery and equipment

3 – 15

Computer software

3 – 5

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the
    estimated useful life or the term of the lease.

The Company reports depreciation and amortization of property,
    plant and equipment in cost of sales and selling, general and
    administrative expenses based on the nature of the underlying
    assets. Depreciation and amortization related to the production
    of inventory and delivery of services are recorded in cost of
    sales. Depreciation and amortization related to distribution
    center activities, selling and support functions are reported in
    selling, general and administrative expenses.

The Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment when
    indicators that the carrying values may not be recoverable are
    present. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, the
    Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and
    liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash
    flows are generated (“asset group”) and estimates the
    undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with
    and expected to be generated from the use of and eventual
    disposition of the asset group. If the carrying value is greater
    than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss must be
    determined and the asset group is written down to fair value.
    The impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying
    amount of the asset group to the estimated fair value, which is
    determined using weighted-average discounted cash flows that
    consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the
    asset group.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS —

Goodwill
    represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the
    underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets
    acquired are recorded at estimated fair value. Goodwill and
    intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not
    amortized, but are tested for impairment annually during the
    third quarter, and at any time when events suggest an impairment
    more likely than not has occurred. To assess goodwill for
    impairment, the Company determines the fair value of its
    reporting units, which are primarily determined using
    management’s assumptions about future cash flows based on
    long-range strategic plans. This approach incorporates many
    assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and
    tax rates. In the event the carrying value of a reporting unit
    exceeded its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized
    to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill.
    Indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying amounts are tested
    for impairment by comparing to current fair market value,
    usually determined by the estimated cost to lease the asset from
    third parties. Intangible assets with definite lives are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives generally using an
    accelerated method. Under this accelerated method, intangible
    assets are amortized reflecting the pattern over which the
    economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed.
    Definite-lived intangible assets are also evaluated for
    impairment when impairment indicators are present. If the
    carrying value exceeds the total undiscounted future cash flows,
    a discounted cash flow analysis is performed to determine the
    fair value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset were
    to exceed the fair value, it would be written down to fair
    value. No goodwill or other significant intangible asset
    impairments were recorded during 2010, 2009 or 2008.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS —

Derivative financial
    instruments are employed to manage risks, including foreign
    currency, interest rate exposures and commodity prices and are
    not used for trading or speculative purposes. The Company
    recognizes all derivative instruments, such as interest rate
    swap agreements, foreign currency options, commodity contracts
    and foreign exchange contracts, in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
    Shareowners’ Equity as a component of other comprehensive
    income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
    is undesignated or qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so,
    whether it represents a fair value, cash flow, or net investment
    hedge. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as
    fair value



hedges are recorded in earnings in the same caption as the
    changes in the fair value of the hedged items. Gains and losses
    on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent
    they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income,
    and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact
    of the hedged items when they occur. In the event it becomes
    probable the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge
    relates will not occur, the derivative would be terminated and
    the amount in other comprehensive income would generally be
    recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    used as hedges of the net investment in foreign operations, to
    the extent they are effective, are reported in other
    comprehensive income and are deferred until the subsidiary is
    sold. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as
    hedges under FASB Accounting Standards Codification,
    (“ASC”) 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”
    (“ASC 815”), and any portion of a hedge that is
    considered ineffective, are reported in earnings in the same
    caption where the hedged items are recognized.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over
    the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

REVENUE RECOGNITION —

General:

Revenue is recognized when the earnings
    process is complete, collectability is reasonably assured, and
    the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the
    customer, which generally occurs upon shipment of the finished
    product but sometimes is upon delivery to customer facilities.

Provisions for customer volume rebates, product returns,
    discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue
    in the same period the related sales are recorded. Consideration
    given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as
    a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is an
    identifiable benefit and evidence of the fair value of the
    advertising, in which case the expense is classified as Selling,
    general, and administrative expense (“SG&A”).

Multiple Element Arrangements:

In 2010, 2009 and
    2008, approximately $900 million, $900 million and
    $1 billion, respectively, in revenues were generated by
    multiple element arrangements, primarily in the Security
    segment. These sales contracts typically consist of products
    sold and installed by the Company at the customer location.
    Revenue from equipment sales is generally recognized once
    installation is complete. Certain sales agreements also include
    maintenance and monitoring services pertaining to the installed
    equipment. Service revenue is recognized ratably over the
    contract term as services are rendered. Customer billings for
    equipment not yet installed and for monitoring services not yet
    rendered are deferred to the extent paid in advance by customers.

When a sales agreement involves multiple elements, deliverables
    are separately identified and consideration is allocated based
    on their relative fair values in accordance with

ASC 605-25,

“Revenue Recognition — Multiple-Element
    Arrangements”. Fair value is generally determined by
    reference to the prices charged in stand-alone transactions.

COST OF SALES AND SELLING, GENERAL &
    ADMINISTRATIVE —

Cost of sales includes the cost
    of products and services provided reflecting costs of
    manufacturing and preparing the product for sale. These costs
    include expenses to acquire and manufacture products to the
    point that they are allocable to be sold to customers and costs
    to perform services pertaining to service revenues (e.g.
    installation of security systems, automatic doors, and security
    monitoring costs). Cost of sales is primarily comprised of
    inbound freight, direct materials, direct labor as well as
    overhead which includes indirect labor, facility and equipment
    costs. Cost of sales also includes quality control, procurement
    and material receiving costs as well as internal transfer costs.
    Selling general and administrative (“SG&A”) costs
    include the cost of selling products as well as administrative
    function costs. These expenses generally represent the cost of
    selling and distributing the products once they are available
    for sale and primarily include salaries and commissions of the
    Company’s sales force, distribution costs, notably salaries
    and facility costs, as well as administrative expenses for
    certain support functions and related overhead.



ADVERTISING COSTS —

Television advertising is
    expensed the first time the advertisement airs, whereas other
    advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs are
    classified in SG&A and amounted to $120.7 million in
    2010, $30.8 million in 2009 and $39.3 million in 2008.
    Expense pertaining to cooperative advertising with customers
    reported as a reduction of net sales was $200.0 million in
    2010, $23.3 million in 2009 and $29.0 million in 2008.
    Cooperative advertising with customers classified as SG&A
    expense amounted to $5.8 million in 2010, $5.7 million
    in 2009 and $6.6 million in 2008.

ACQUISITION COSTS —

In fiscal 2010 and 2009
    costs associated with new business acquisitions are expensed as
    incurred as required under SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations,” (“FAS 141(R)”)
    codified in ASC 805, “Business Combinations”
    (“ASC 805”). Refer to the section entitled New
    Accounting Standards also included within Note A for
    further details. Prior to 2009, certain costs directly related
    to acquisitions including legal, audit and other fees, were
    recorded to goodwill.

SALES TAXES —

Sales and value added taxes
    collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities are excluded from Net sales reported in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS —

The Company
    generally does not bill customers for freight. Shipping and
    handling costs associated with inbound freight are reported in
    cost of sales. Shipping costs associated with outbound freight
    are reported as a reduction of Net sales and amounted to
    $161.6 million, $87.1 million and $129.7 million
    in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Distribution costs are
    classified as SG&A and amounted to $198.1 million,
    $102.2 million and $122.2 million in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION —

Compensation cost
    relating to stock-based compensation grants is recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally
    four years. The expense for stock options and restricted stock
    units awarded to retirement eligible employees (those aged 55
    and over, and with 10 or more years of service) is recognized on
    the grant date, or (if later) by the date they become
    retirement-eligible.

POSTRETIREMENT DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN —

The
    Company uses the corridor approach to determine expense
    recognition for each defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plan. The corridor approach defers actuarial
    gains and losses resulting from variances between actual and
    expected results (based on economic estimates or actuarial
    assumptions) and amortizes them over future periods. For pension
    plans, these unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when
    the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the
    market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. For other
    postretirement benefits, amortization occurs when the net gains
    and losses exceed 10% of the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation at the beginning of the year. For ongoing, active
    plans, the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the average remaining service period
    for active plan participants. For plans with primarily inactive
    participants, the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the average remaining life
    expectancy of inactive plan participants.

INCOME TAXES —

Income tax expense is based on
    reported earnings before income taxes. Interest and penalties
    related to income taxes are classified as Income taxes on
    continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of
    temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized
    for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for
    tax purposes, and are measured by applying enacted tax rates in
    effect in years in which the differences are expected to
    reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred
    tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
    realized.

EARNINGS PER SHARE —

Basic earnings per share
    equals net earnings attributable to Stanley Black &
    Decker, Inc., less earnings allocated to restricted stock units
    with non-forfeitable dividend rights, divided by
    weighted-average shares outstanding during the year. Diluted
    earnings per share include the impact of common stock
    equivalents using the treasury stock method when the effect is
    dilutive.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS —

The Company has evaluated
    subsequent events through the date of issuance of the
    Company’s annual financial statements.



NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Implemented:

In September 2006, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” (“SFAS 157”) codified in
    ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure”
    (“ASC 820”). SFAS 157 establishes a single
    definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair
    value, sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify
    the source of information used in fair value measurements, and
    requires new disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at
    fair value based on their level in the hierarchy. SFAS 157
    indicates that an exit value (selling price) should be utilized
    in fair value measurements rather than an entrance value, or
    cost basis, and that performance risks, such as credit risk,
    should be included in the measurements of fair value even when
    the risk of non-performance is remote. SFAS 157 also
    clarifies the principle that fair value measurements should be
    based on assumptions the marketplace would use when pricing an
    asset whenever practicable, rather than company-specific
    assumptions. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 157-1

and

157-2,

which respectively removed leasing transactions and deferred its
    effective date for one year relative to nonfinancial assets and
    nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    recurring basis (at least annually). Accordingly, in fiscal 2008
    the Company applied SFAS 157 guidance to: (i) all
    applicable financial assets and liabilities; and
    (ii) nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company’s
    financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually).
    In January 2009, the Company applied this guidance to all
    remaining assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring
    basis at fair value. The adoption of SFAS 157 for these
    items did not have an effect on the Company. Refer to
    Note M, Fair Value Measurements, for disclosures relating
    to ASC 820.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations,”
    (“SFAS 141(R)”) codified in ASC 805,
    “Business Combinations”. SFAS 141(R) requires the
    acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full
    fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
    transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition), establishes
    the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for
    all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires the
    acquirer to disclose the information needed to evaluate and
    understand the nature and effect of the business combination.
    This statement applies to all transactions or other events in
    which the acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses,
    including those sometimes referred to as “true
    mergers” or “mergers of equals” and combinations
    achieved without the transfer of consideration, for example, by
    contract alone or through the lapse of minority veto rights. For
    new acquisitions made following the adoption of
    SFAS 141(R), significant costs directly related to the
    acquisition including legal, audit and other fees, as well as
    most acquisition-related restructuring, must be expensed as
    incurred. For the years ended January 1, 2011 and
    January 2, 2010 the Company expensed $83.5 million and
    $24.1 million of acquisition-related costs, respectively.
    Additionally, as part of SFAS 141(R) contingent purchase
    price arrangements (also known as earn-outs) must be re-measured
    to estimated fair value with the impact reported in earnings.
    With respect to all acquisitions, including those consummated in
    prior years, changes in tax reserves pertaining to resolution of
    contingencies or other post acquisition developments are
    recorded to earnings rather than goodwill. SFAS 141(R) was
    applied to the Company’s business combinations completed in
    fiscal 2010 and 2009.

In December 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

No. 2009-16,

“Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets”. This
    ASU eliminates the concept of a “qualifying special-purpose
    entity,” clarifies when a transferor of financial assets
    has surrendered control over the transferred financial assets,
    defines specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a
    portion of a financial asset as a sale, requires that a
    transferor recognize and initially measure at fair value all
    assets obtained and liabilities incurred as a result of a
    transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale, and
    requires enhanced disclosures to provide financial statement
    users with greater transparency about a transferor’s
    continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. The
    adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on the consolidated
    financial statements.

In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-17,

“Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises
    Involved with Variable Interest Entities.” This ASU
    eliminates the concept of a “qualifying special-purpose
    entity”, replaces the quantitative approach for determining
    which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a
    variable interest entity with a qualitative approach focused on
    identifying which enterprise has a controlling financial
    interest through the power to direct the activities of a
    variable interest entity that most significantly impact the
    entity’s economic performance. Additionally, this ASU
    requires enhanced disclosures



that provide users of financial statements with more information
    about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable interest
    entity. In January 2010, the Company applied this guidance and
    the adoption of the ASU did not have a significant impact on the
    consolidated financial statements.

In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2010-20,

“Disclosures About the Credit Quality of Financing
    Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses.” This ASU
    amends existing disclosures to require a company to provide a
    greater level of disaggregated information about the credit
    quality of its financing receivables and its allowance for
    credit losses. In December 2010, the Company applied this
    guidance to its financing receivables. Refer to Note B,
    Accounts and Notes Receivable.

Not Yet Implemented:

In October 2009, the FASB
    issued ASU

2009-13,

“Revenue Recognition
    (Topic 605) — Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
    Arrangements”. This ASU eliminates the requirement that all
    undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence
    of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the
    consideration that is attributable to items that already have
    been delivered. This may allow some companies to recognize
    revenue on transactions that involve multiple deliverables
    earlier than under the current requirements. Additionally, under
    the new guidance, the relative selling price method is required
    to be used in allocating consideration between deliverables and
    the residual value method will no longer be permitted. This ASU
    is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into
    or materially modified beginning in fiscal 2011 although early
    adoption is permitted. A company may elect, but will not be
    required, to adopt the amendments in this ASU retrospectively
    for all prior periods. The Company has evaluated the ASU and
    does not believe it will have a material impact on the
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-28,

“Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic
    350).” This ASU modifies the first step of the goodwill
    impairment test to include reporting units with zero or negative
    carrying amounts. For these reporting units, the second step of
    the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the
    amount of impairment loss, if any, when it is more likely than
    not that a goodwill impairment exists. This ASU is effective for
    fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
    December 15, 2010. The Company has evaluated the ASU and
    does not believe it will have a material impact on the
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-29,

“Business Combinations (Topic 805).” This ASU
    specifies that if a company presents comparative financial
    statements, the company should disclose revenue and earnings of
    the combined entity as though the business combination that
    occurred during the year had occurred as of the beginning of the
    comparable prior annual reporting period only. The ASU also
    expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under Topic 805
    to include a description of the nature and amount of material,
    nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the
    business combination included in the pro forma revenue and
    earnings. This ASU is effective prospectively for business
    combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
    beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or
    after December 15, 2010. Effective January 1, 2011,
    the Company will adopt this ASU and include all required
    disclosures in the notes to its consolidated financial
    statements.

Trade receivables are dispersed among a large number of

    anticipated credit losses. Long-term trade financing receivables
    are reported within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. Financing receivables and long-term financing
    receivables are predominately related to certain security
    equipment leases with commercial businesses. Generally, the
    Company retains legal title to any equipment leases and bears
    the right to repossess such equipment in an event of default.
    All financing receivables are interest bearing and the Company
    has not classified any financing receivables as

held-for-sale.

In December 2009, the Company entered into an accounts
    receivable sale program that was scheduled to expire on
    December 28, 2010. On December 13, 2010, the Company
    extended the term of that program for one year and the program
    is now scheduled to expire on December 12, 2011. According
    to the terms of that program the Company is required to sell
    certain of its trade accounts receivables at fair value to a
    wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary
    (“BRS”). The BRS, in turn, must sell such receivables
    to a third-party financial institution (“Purchaser”)
    for cash and a deferred purchase price receivable. The
    Purchaser’s maximum cash investment in the receivables at
    any time is $100.0 million. The purpose of the program is
    to provide liquidity to the Company. The Company accounts for
    these transfers as sales under ASC 860 “Transfers and
    Servicing”. The Company has no retained interests in the
    transferred receivables, other than collection and
    administrative responsibilities and its right to the deferred
    purchase price receivable. At January 1, 2011 the Company
    did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its
    retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the
    servicing fee, market values for similar transactions and its
    cost of servicing the receivables sold.

As of January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010,
    $31.5 million and $35.2 million of net receivables
    were derecognized. Gross receivables sold amounted to
    $552.1 million ($492.9 million, net) for the year
    ended January 1, 2011. These sales resulted in a pre-tax
    loss of $1.4 million for the year ended January 1,
    2011. Proceeds from transfers of receivables to the Purchaser
    totaled $495.3 million for the year ended January 1,
    2011. Collections of previously sold receivables, including
    deferred purchase price receivables, and all fees, which are
    settled one month in arrears, resulted in payments to the
    Purchaser of $498.8 million for the year ended
    January 1, 2011. Servicing fees amounted to
    $0.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2011. The
    Company’s risk of loss following the sale of the
    receivables is limited to the deferred purchase price, which was
    $13.8 million at January 1, 2011 and
    $17.7 million at January 2, 2010. The deferred
    purchase price receivable will be repaid in cash as receivables
    are collected, generally within 30 days, and as such the
    carrying value of the receivable recorded approximates fair
    value. Delinquencies and credit losses on receivables sold in
    2010 were less than $0.2 million for the year ended
    January 1, 2011. Cash inflows related to the deferred
    purchase price receivable totaled $174.4 million for the
    year ended January 1, 2011. All cash flows under the
    program are reported as a component of changes in accounts
    receivable within operating activities in the consolidated
    statements of cash flows since all the cash from the Purchaser
    is either: 1) received upon the initial sale of the
    receivable; or 2) from the ultimate collection of the
    underlying receivables and the underlying receivables are not
    subject to significant risks, other than credit risk, given
    their short-term nature.

MERGER
    AND ACQUISITIONS

MERGER

On March 12, 2010 (the “merger date”), a wholly
    owned subsidiary of The Stanley Works (“Stanley”) was
    merged with and into Black & Decker, with the result
    that Black & Decker became a wholly owned subsidiary
    of Stanley. As part of the Merger, Black & Decker
    stockholders received 1.275 shares of Stanley stock for
    each share outstanding as of the merger date. All of the
    outstanding Black & Decker shares and equity based
    awards were exchanged for Stanley shares and equity awards as
    part of the Merger. Fractional shares generated by the
    conversion ratio were cash settled for $0.3 million. After
    the exchange was completed, pre-merger Stanley shareowners
    retained ownership of 50.5% of the combined Company. In
    conjunction with consummating the Merger, the name of the
    combined Company was changed to “Stanley Black &
    Decker, Inc”.

Black & Decker is a global manufacturer and marketer
    of power tools and accessories, hardware and home improvement
    products, and technology-based fastening systems. The Merger
    creates a larger and more globally diversified company with a
    broad array of products and services with significant exposure
    to growing and profitable product areas. Stanley and
    Black & Decker’s product lines are generally
    complementary, and do not present areas of significant overlap.
    By combining the two companies, there are significant cost
    saving opportunities through reductions in corporate overhead,
    business unit and purchasing consolidation, and by combining
    elements of manufacturing and distribution.



Based on the closing price of Stanley common stock on the merger
    date, the consideration received by Black & Decker
    shareholders in the Merger had a value of $4.657 billion as
    detailed below.

As part of the Merger the Company exchanged the pre-merger
    equity awards of Black & Decker for Stanley
    Black & Decker equity awards. Under ASC 805, the
    fair value of vested options and the earned portion of unvested
    options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are
    recognized as consideration paid. The remaining value relating
    to the unvested and unearned options, restricted stock awards
    and restricted stock units will be recognized as future
    stock-based compensation. The allocation of the pre-merger
    equity awards between consideration paid and future stock-based
    compensation is as follows (in millions):

The expected volatility is based on two equally weighted
    components: the first component is the average historical
    volatility which is based on daily observations and duration
    consistent with the expected life assumption; the second
    component is the market implied volatility of traded options.
    The average expected term of the option is based on historical
    employee stock option exercise behavior as well as the remaining
    contractual exercise term. The risk-free interest rate is based
    on U.S. treasury securities with maturities equal to the
    expected life of the option. The fair value of restricted stock
    and restricted stock units and other vested equity awards was
    $57.86 per share. Total compensation expense recognized during
    the year ended January 1, 2011 for the options, restricted
    stock, and restricted stock awards that were assumed as part of
    the Merger was $8.8 million.



The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition
    method of accounting which requires, among other things, the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their
    fair values as of the merger date. The following table
    summarizes the estimated fair values of major assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed as part of the Merger:

As of the merger date, the expected fair value of accounts
    receivable approximated the historical cost. The gross
    contractual receivable was $951.7 million, of which
    $44.4 million was not expected to be collectible.

The amount allocated to trade names includes $1.362 billion
    for indefinite-lived trade names. The weighted-average useful
    lives assigned to the finite-lived intangible assets are trade
    names — 14 years; customer
    relationships — 15 years; and licenses,
    technology and patents — 12 years.

Black & Decker has three primary areas of contingent
    liabilities: environmental, risk insurance (predominantly
    product liability and workers compensation) and uncertain tax
    liabilities. Additionally, Black & Decker is involved
    in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business,
    including litigation and administrative proceedings involving
    commercial disputes and employment matters. Some of these
    lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory
    damages. The majority of the contingent liabilities are recorded
    at fair value in purchase accounting, aside from those
    pertaining to uncertainty in income taxes which are an exception
    to the fair value basis of accounting; however certain
    environmental matters that are more legal in nature are recorded
    at the probable and estimable amount.

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration
    transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the
    expected revenue and cost synergies of the combined business,
    assembled workforce, and the going concern nature of
    Black & Decker. It is estimated that
    $167.7 million of goodwill, relating to Black &
    Decker’s pre-merger historical tax basis, will be
    deductible for tax purposes.

The purchase price allocation for Black & Decker is
    substantially complete. As the Company finalizes its purchase
    price allocation, it is anticipated that additional purchase
    price adjustments will be recorded relating to certain
    environmental remediation liabilities for ongoing feasibility
    study results, tax matters, and for other minor items. Such
    adjustments will be recorded during the measurement period in
    the first quarter of 2011. A single estimate of fair value
    results from a complex series of judgments about future events
    and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and
    assumptions. The Company’s judgments used to determine the
    estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially
    impact the Company’s results from operations. The
    finalization of the Company’s purchase accounting



assessment will result in changes in the valuation of assets and
    liabilities acquired which is not expected to have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of
    operations, balance sheet or cash flows.

ACQUISITIONS

The Company completed thirty acquisitions during 2010, 2009, and
    2008. These businesses were acquired pursuant to the
    Company’s growth and portfolio repositioning strategy. The
    2010 and 2009 acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with
    ASC 805 while 2008 acquisitions were accounted for as
    purchases in accordance with SFAS No. 141
    “Business Combinations”. During 2010, the Company
    completed ten acquisitions for an aggregate value of
    $547.3 million aside from the Merger. During 2009, the
    Company completed six acquisitions for an aggregate value of
    $24.2 million. During 2008, the Company completed fourteen
    acquisitions for an aggregate value of $572.4 million. The
    results of the acquired companies are included in the
    Company’s consolidated operating results from the
    respective acquisition dates. All of the acquisitions have
    resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill reflects the
    future earnings and cash flow potential of the acquired business
    in excess of the fair values that are assigned to all other
    identifiable assets and liabilities. Goodwill arises because the
    purchase price paid reflects numerous factors including the
    strategic fit and expected synergies these targets bring to
    existing operations, the competitive nature of the bidding
    process and the prevailing market value for comparable
    companies. ASC 805 requires all identifiable assets and
    liabilities acquired to be reported at fair value and the excess
    is recorded as goodwill. The Company obtains information during
    due diligence and from other sources which forms the basis for
    the initial allocation of purchase price to the estimated fair
    value of assets and liabilities acquired. In the months
    following an acquisition, intangible asset valuation reports,
    asset appraisals and other data are obtained in order for
    management to finalize the fair values assigned to acquired
    assets and liabilities.

In November 2010 the Company purchased 70% of the outstanding
    shares of GMT for $44.2 million, net of cash acquired. GMT
    is a leading commercial hardware manufacturer and distributor in
    China. The acquisition of GMT provides the Company with a low
    cost manufacturing source and also serves as a platform for
    international commercial hardware expansion. The Company has the
    option to purchase the remaining 30% of GMT outstanding shares
    over the next five years. GMT is included in the Company’s
    Security segment.

In July 2010 the Company completed the acquisition of CRC-Evans
    Pipeline International (“CRC-Evans”) for
    $451.6 million, net of cash acquired and subject to certain
    adjustments including an earn-out provision with the previous
    CRC-Evans’ shareholders. The net assets acquired, including
    $181.2 million of other intangible assets, are
    approximately $233.6 million and the related Goodwill is
    approximately $218.0 million. CRC-Evans is a full line
    supplier of specialized tools, equipment and services used in
    the construction of large diameter oil and natural gas
    transmission pipelines. CRC-Evans also sells and rents custom
    pipe handling and joint welding and coating equipment used in
    the construction of large and small diameter pipelines. The
    acquisition of CRC Evan’s diversifies the Company’s
    revenue base and provides the Company with a strategic and
    profitable growth platform. CRC-Evans is included in the
    Company’s Industrial segment.

Under the earn-out provision, the total purchase price for
    CRC-Evans was contingent upon 2010 earnings before interest,
    income taxes, depreciation and amortization and the earn-out
    performance period ended on December 31, 2010. As of the
    acquisition date it was estimated that there would be no
    purchase price adjustment occurring at the end of the
    performance period as the probability of a significant increase
    or decrease in total consideration was been deemed to be equally
    unlikely. Accordingly, the Company did not recognize an asset or
    liability relating to contingent consideration at the
    acquisition date. The performance period ended in 2010 with no
    additional adjustment to purchase price required.

In March 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of Stanley
    Solutions de Sécurité (“SSDS”) (formerly
    known as ADT France) for $8.0 million, net of cash
    acquired. SSDS is a leading provider of security services,
    primarily for commercial businesses located in France. SSDS has
    been consolidated into the Company’s Security segment. This
    acquisition added to the Company’s current business gives
    the Company the leading market share in France and expands its
    security footprint in Europe.

During 2010, the Company also completed seven minor
    acquisitions, relating to the Company’s Industrial and
    Security segments. The combined purchase price of these
    acquisitions was $43.5 million.



The purchase accounting for the 2010 acquisitions is
    preliminary, principally with respect to finalization of
    intangible asset valuations, contingencies, deferred taxes, the
    valuation of property, plant and equipment and certain other
    items.

2010 Pro
    Forma Results

The 2010 pro forma results were calculated by combining the
    results of Stanley Black & Decker with
    Black & Decker’s stand-alone results from
    January 3, 2010 through March 12, 2010. The
    pre-acquisition results of the acquisitions were also combined
    for their respective pre-acquisition periods. The following
    adjustments were made to account for certain costs which would
    have been incurred during this pre-Merger and pre-acquisition
    period.

•

Elimination of the historical pre-Merger and pre-acquisition
    intangible asset amortization expense and the addition of
    intangible asset amortization expense related to intangibles
    valued as part of the Merger and acquisitions that would have
    been incurred from January 3, 2010 to the merger

and/or

acquisition dates.

•

Additional expense for the inventory

step-up

which would have been amortized as the corresponding inventory
    was sold.

•

Additional expense relating to Merger-related compensation for
    key executives which would have been incurred from
    January 3, 2010 to March 12, 2010.

•

Reduced interest expense for the Black & Decker debt
    fair value adjustment which would have been amortized from
    January 3, 2010 to March 12, 2010.

•

Additional depreciation related to property, plant and equipment
    fair value adjustments that would have been expensed prior to
    the Merger and acquisitions commencement dates.

•

The modifications above were adjusted for the applicable tax
    impact.



2009 Pro
    Forma Results

The 2009 pro forma results were calculated by taking the
    historical financial results of Stanley and adding the
    historical results of Black & Decker and the
    acquisitions. Additionally the following adjustments were made
    to account for certain costs that would have been incurred in
    2009 had the Merger and acquisitions occurred on January 4,
    2009.

•

Elimination of historical Black & Decker and
    acquisitions’ intangible asset amortization expense and
    addition of intangible asset amortization expense relating to
    intangibles valued as part of the Merger and acquisitions.

•

Added expense for the inventory

step-up

which would have been amortized as the corresponding inventory
    was sold.

•

Added the costs that were incurred to consummate the Merger and
    acquisitions during 2010.

•

Added the Merger and acquisition-related restructuring charges
    which were incurred during 2010.

•

Added compensation expense for Merger-related compensation for
    key executives.

•

Added depreciation expense related to property, plant, and
    equipment fair value adjustments.

•

Reduced interest expense for the debt fair value adjustment
    which would have been amortized during 2009.

The modifications above were adjusted for the applicable tax
    impact.

2009 ACQUISITIONS —

During 2009, the Company
    completed six minor acquisitions, primarily relating to the
    Company’s convergent security solutions business, for a
    combined purchase price of $24.2 million. Amounts allocated
    to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on
    their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. The
    purchase price allocations of these acquisitions are complete.

2008 ACQUISITIONS —

In July 2008, the Company
    completed the acquisition of Sonitrol Corporation
    (“Sonitrol”) for $282.3 million in cash. Sonitrol
    is a market leader in North American commercial security
    monitoring services, access control and fire detection systems.
    The acquisition has complemented the product offering of the
    pre-existing security integration businesses including HSM
    acquired in early 2007.

Also in July 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of
    Xmark Corporation (“Xmark”) for $47.0 million in
    cash. Xmark, headquartered in Canada, markets and sells radio
    frequency identification-based systems used to identify, locate
    and protect people and assets. The acquisition expanded the
    Company’s personal security business.

In October 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of
    Generale de Protection (“GdP”) for $168.8 million
    in cash. GdP, headquartered in Vitrolles, France, is a leading
    provider of audio and video security monitoring services,
    primarily for small and mid-sized businesses located in France
    and Belgium.

The Company also made eleven small acquisitions relating to its
    mechanical access systems, convergent security solutions,
    including healthcare storage systems, and fastening businesses
    during 2008. These eleven acquisitions were completed for a
    combined purchase price of $74.3 million.

The total purchase price of $572.4 million reflects
    transaction costs and is net of cash acquired; amounts allocated
    to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on
    their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Goodwill
    associated with the 2008 acquisitions that is deductible for
    income tax purposes amounts to $40.7 million. The purchase
    price allocation of these acquisitions has been completed.

The Company acquired $1.832 billion of total debt and
    short-term borrowings in connection with the Merger which
    included $157.1 million to increase the debt balance to its
    estimated fair value. Principal amounts and maturities of the
    notes acquired in the Merger are: $400.0 million due in
    2011, $300.0 million due in 2014,



$350.0 million due in 2014, $300.0 million due in 2016
    and $150.0 million due in 2028. $175.0 million of
    assumed short-term borrowings were repaid in April 2010 with the
    proceeds from additional commercial paper borrowings. The
    Company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the
    existing debt of The Black & Decker Corporation and
    Black & Decker Holdings, LLC (this guarantee is
    applicable to all of the Black & Decker outstanding
    notes payable), and Black & Decker executed a full and
    unconditional guarantee of the existing debt of the Company,
    excluding the Company’s Junior Subordinated Debt (redeemed
    in December 2010), including for payments of principal and
    interest and as such these notes rank equally in priority with
    the Company’s unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Refer to
    Note U, Parent and Subsidiary Debt Guarantees, for
    additional information pertaining to these debt guarantees.

Aggregate annual principal maturities of long-term debt for each
    of the years from 2011 to 2015 are $406.7 million,
    $525.4 million, $253.6 million, $654.4 million,
    $0.7 million, respectively and $1,482.6 million
    thereafter. These debt maturities represent the principal
    amounts to be paid and accordingly exclude the remaining
    $119.2 million of unamortized debt fair value adjustment as
    of January 1, 2011 which increased the Black &
    Decker debt, as well as $6.5 million of fair value
    adjustments and unamortized interest rate swap termination gains
    as described in Note I, Derivative Financial Instruments.
    These amounts are partially offset by $14.9 million of
    remaining accretion on the Stanley Convertible Notes as of
    January 1, 2011 that will gradually increase the debt to
    its $320.0 million principal amount due in May 2012.
    Interest paid during 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to
    $76.0 million, $53.7 million and $78.9 million,
    respectively.

On March 12, 2010, the Company amended its
    $800.0 million committed credit facility to include
    adjustments to the interest coverage ratio covenant for
    restructuring and merger and acquisition-related items. This
    facility expires in February 2013. The Company also entered into
    a $700.0 million,

364-day

revolving credit facility effective March 12, 2010 that
    will expire in March 2011. The credit facilities are designated
    as a liquidity back-stop for the Company’s commercial paper
    program which was increased on March 12, 2010 to
    $1.5 billion. These changes to the Company’s
    short-term borrowing capacity were related to the Merger. In
    addition, the Company has short-term lines of credit that are
    primarily committed, with numerous banks, aggregating
    $971.2 million, including the $700.0 million

364-day

revolving credit facility, of which $947.9 million was
    available at January 1, 2011. Short-term arrangements are
    reviewed annually for renewal. The aggregate long-term and
    short-term lines amounted to $1,771.2 million of which
    $1.6 million was utilized as outstanding short-term
    borrowings at January 1, 2011. The Company had no
    commercial paper borrowing outstanding at January 1, 2011.
    Included in short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets as of January 2, 2010 is commercial paper of
    $87.0 million. The weighted average interest rates on
    short-term borrowings for the fiscal years ended January 1,
    2011 and January 2, 2010 were 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.

On August 31, 2010, the Company issued $400.0 million
    of senior unsecured Term Bonds, maturing on September 1,
    2040 (“2040 Term Bonds”) with fixed interest payable
    semi-annually, in arrears at a rate of 5.20% per annum. The 2040
    Term Bonds rank equally with all of the Company’s existing
    and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2040 Term
    Bonds are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by The
    Black & Decker Corporation, a subsidiary of the
    Company. The 2040 Term Bonds are not obligations of or
    guaranteed by any of the Company’s other subsidiaries. As a
    result, the 2040 Term Bonds are structurally subordinated to all
    debt and other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries
    other than The Black & Decker Corporation. The Company
    received net proceeds of $396.2 million which reflects a
    discount of $0.4 million to achieve a 5.20% interest rate
    and paid $3.4 million of fees associated with the
    transaction. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering
    primarily to reduce borrowings under its existing commercial
    paper program. The 2040 Term Bonds include a Change of Control
    provision that would apply should a Change of Control event (as
    defined in the Indenture governing the 2040 Term Bonds) occur.
    The Change of Control provision states that the holders of the
    Term Bonds may require the Company to repurchase, in cash, all
    of the outstanding 2040 Term Bonds for a purchase price at
    101.0% of the original principal amount, plus any accrued and
    unpaid interest outstanding up to the repurchase date.

On September 29, 2008, the Company issued
    $250.0 million of unsecured Term Notes maturing
    October 1, 2013 (the “2013 Term Notes”) with
    fixed interest payable semi-annually, in arrears at a rate of
    6.15% per annum. The 2013 Term Notes rank equally with all of
    the Company’s existing and future unsecured and
    unsubordinated debt. The Company received net proceeds of
    $248.0 million which includes a discount of



$0.5 million to achieve a 6.15% interest rate and
    $1.5 million of fees associated with the transaction. The
    Company used the net proceeds from the offering primarily to
    reduce borrowings under its existing commercial paper program.
    The $260.8 million of debt reported at January 1, 2011
    reflects the fair value adjustment related to a

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap entered into at the beginning of 2009, as
    well as the unamortized balance of the $7.9 million gain
    from a December 2008 swap termination. This

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap was entered into upon issuance of the 2013
    Term Notes as detailed in Note I, Derivative Financial
    Instruments. The 2013 Term Notes include a Change of Control
    Triggering Event that would apply should a Change of Control
    event (as defined in the Indenture governing the 2013 Term
    Notes) occur. The Company would be required to make an offer to
    repurchase, in cash, all of the outstanding 2013 Term Notes for
    a purchase price at 101.0% of the original principal amount,
    plus any accrued and unpaid interest outstanding up to the
    purchase date.

In January 2009, the Company entered into a

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap on its $200.0 million notes payable due
    in 2012. The Company previously had a

fixed-to-floating

rate swap on these notes outstanding that was terminated in
    December 2008. The $8.4 million adjustment to the carrying
    value of the debt at January 1, 2011 pertains to the
    unamortized gain on the terminated swap as well as the fair
    value adjustment of the new swap, as more fully discussed in
    Note I, Derivative Financial Instruments.

In December 2010, the Company entered into a

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap on its $300.0 million notes payable due
    in 2014. At January 1, 2011 the carrying value of the debt
    includes a $12.0 million increase associated with the fair
    value adjustment made in purchase accounting partially offset by
    $4.1 million pertaining to the fair value adjustment of the
    swap, as more fully discussed in Note I, Derivative
    Financial Instruments.

In December 2010, the Company entered into a

fixed-to-floating

interest rate swap on its $300.0 million notes payable due
    in 2016. At January 1, 2011 the carrying value of the debt
    includes a $24.2 million increase associated with the fair
    value adjustment made in purchase accounting partially offset by
    $8.2 million pertaining to the fair value adjustment of the
    swap, as more fully discussed in Note I, Derivative
    Financial Instruments.

Convertible
    Preferred Units

On November 5, 2010, the Company issued 6,325,000
    Convertible Preferred Units (the “Convertible Preferred
    Units”), each with a stated amount of $100. The Convertible
    Preferred Units are initially comprised of a 1/10, or 10%,
    undivided beneficial ownership in a $1,000 principal amount
    junior subordinated note (the “Note”) and a Purchase
    Contract (the “Purchase Contract”) obligating holders
    to purchase one share (subject to adjustment under certain
    circumstances if holders elect to settle their Purchase
    Contracts early) of the Company’s 4.75% Series B
    Perpetual Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the
    “Convertible Preferred Stock”). The Company received
    $613.5 million in cash proceeds from the Convertible
    Preferred Units offering, net of underwriting fees. These
    proceeds were used to redeem all of the Company’s
    outstanding 5.902% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated
    Debt Securities due 2045 on December 8, 2010, at a price of
    $312.7 million, to contribute $150.0 million to a
    U.S. pension plan to improve the funded status of the
    Company’s pension obligations, to fund the
    $50.3 million cost of the capped call transaction as more
    fully described below, and the remainder to reduce outstanding
    short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes.

Purchase
    Contracts:

Each Purchase Contract obligates the holder to purchase, on the
    earlier of (i) November 17, 2015 (the “Purchase
    Contract settlement date”) or (ii) the triggered early
    settlement date (as described below), for $100, one newly-issued
    share (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances if
    holders elect to settle their Purchase Contracts early) of
    Convertible Preferred Stock. A maximum of 6,325,000 shares
    of Convertible Preferred Stock may be issued on the Purchase
    Contract settlement date, resulting in total additional cash
    proceeds to the Company of up to $632.5 million. The Notes,
    described further below, are pledged as collateral to guarantee
    the holders’ obligations to purchase Convertible Preferred
    Stock under the terms of the Purchase Contracts. Purchase
    Contract holders may elect to settle their obligations under the
    Purchase Contracts early,



in cash, at any time prior to the second business day
    immediately preceding the Purchase Contract settlement date or
    the triggered early settlement date, as applicable, subject to
    certain exceptions and conditions.

Upon early settlement of any Purchase Contracts, except in
    connection with a “fundamental change” or trigger
    event, the Company will deliver a number of shares of
    Convertible Preferred Stock equal to 85% of the number of
    Purchase Contracts tendered for early settlement. Upon the
    occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of Purchase
    Contracts will have the right, subject to certain exceptions and
    conditions, to settle their Purchase Contracts early at 100% of
    the settlement rate for the Purchase Contracts.

Holders of the Purchase Contracts are paid contract adjustment
    payments (“contract adjustment payments”) at a rate of
    0.50% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on
    February 17, May 17, August 17 and November 17 of each
    year, commencing February 17, 2011. The $14.9 million
    present value of the contract adjustment payments reduced
    Shareowners’ Equity at inception. As each quarterly
    contract adjustment payment is made, the related liability will
    be relieved with the difference between the cash payment and the
    present value of the contract adjustment payment recorded as
    interest expense (at inception approximately $0.9 million
    accretion over the five year term). At January 1, 2011 the
    liability reported for the contract adjustment payments amounted
    to $14.9 million. The Company has the right to defer the
    payment of contract adjustment payments until no later than the
    Purchase Contract settlement date or the triggered early
    settlement date (each as described below), as applicable. Any
    deferred contract adjustment payments will accrue additional
    contract adjustment payments at the rate of 4.75% per year until
    paid, compounded quarterly.

Convertible
    Preferred Stock:

When issued following a settlement of the Purchase Contract,
    holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to
    receive cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 4.75% per annum
    of the $100 liquidation preference per share of the Convertible
    Preferred Stock. Dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock
    will be payable, when, as and if declared by the Company’s
    board of directors, quarterly in arrears on February 17,
    May 17, August 17 and November 17 of each year.

Following the issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock upon
    settlement of a holder’s Purchase Contracts, a holder of
    Convertible Preferred Stock may, at its option, at any time and
    from time to time, convert some or all of its outstanding shares
    of Convertible Preferred Stock as described below at a
    conversion rate of 1.3333 shares of the Company’s
    common stock per share of Convertible Preferred Stock (subject
    to customary anti-dilution adjustments), which is equivalent to
    an initial conversion price of approximately $75.00 per share of
    common stock. If a fundamental change occurs, in certain
    circumstances the conversion rate may be adjusted by a
    fundamental change make-whole premium.

The Company may redeem some or all of the Convertible Preferred
    Stock on or after December 22, 2015 at a redemption price
    equal to 100% of the liquidation preference per share plus
    accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. If the
    Company calls the Convertible Preferred Stock for redemption,
    holders may convert their Convertible Preferred Stock at any
    time prior to the close of business on the business day
    immediately preceding the redemption date.

Upon conversion prior to November 17, 2015, the Company may
    only deliver shares of common stock, together with cash in lieu
    of fractional shares. Upon a conversion on or after
    November 17, 2015, the Company may elect to pay or deliver,
    as the case may be, solely shares of common stock, together with
    cash in lieu of fractional shares (“physical
    settlement”), solely cash (“cash settlement”) or
    a combination of cash and common stock (“combination
    settlement”). The amount of shares

and/or

cash
    that each holder of Convertible Preferred Stock will receive is
    called the “settlement amount.” If the Company elects
    physical settlement or any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock
    are converted prior to November 17, 2015, the Company will
    deliver to the converting holder a number of shares of common
    stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares) equal to the
    number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted
    multiplied by the applicable conversion rate. If the Company
    elects cash settlement or combination settlement, the settlement
    amount will be based on the volume weighted average price of the
    Company’s common stock during a 20 day observation
    period.



Notes:

The $632.5 million principal amount of the Notes is due
    November 17, 2018. At maturity, the Company is obligated to
    repay the principal in cash. The Notes bear interest at an
    initial rate of 4.25% per annum, initially payable quarterly in
    arrears on February 17, May 17, August 17 and November
    17 of each year, commencing February 17, 2011, subject to
    the Company’s right to defer interest payments. The Notes
    are the Company’s direct, unsecured general obligations and
    are initially subordinated and junior in right of payment to the
    Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. The
    Notes initially rank equally in right of payment with all of the
    Company’s other junior subordinated debt. The Notes are
    initially pledged as collateral to guarantee the obligations of
    holders of Purchase Contracts to purchase Convertible Preferred
    Stock. The Notes will be released from that pledge arrangement
    (1) following a successful remarketing, (2) following
    the substitution of cash to purchase certain treasury unit
    collateral, (3) following the substitution of cash during
    certain periods prior to the final remarketing period or
    triggered remarketed period for the Notes, (4) following
    the early settlement of the Purchase Contracts or
    (5) following certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
    reorganization. The unamortized deferred issuance cost of the
    Notes was $6.5 million at January 1, 2011. The
    remaining unamortized balance will be recorded to interest
    expense through the Notes maturity in November 2018.

Unless a trigger event (as defined below) has occurred, the
    Company may elect, at its option, to remarket the Notes during a
    period (the “optional remarketing window”) beginning
    on and including August 12, 2015 until October 27,
    2015. Such remarketing will include the Notes underlying
    Convertible Preferred Units that have not been released from the
    pledge and other Notes of holders that have elected to include
    those Notes in the remarketing. The Company may attempt to
    remarket the Notes during multiple optional remarketing periods
    in the optional remarketing window so long as it gives 15
    calendar days notice prior to the first day of any optional
    remarketing period. Upon a successful optional remarketing of
    the Notes, the remarketing agent will purchase
    U.S. Treasury securities as described in the prospectus
    supplement (the “Treasury portfolio”), and deduct such
    price from the proceeds of the optional remarketing. Any
    remaining proceeds will be promptly remitted after the optional
    remarketing settlement date by the remarketing agent for the
    benefit of the holders whose Notes were remarketed. The
    applicable ownership interests in the Treasury portfolio will be
    substituted for the applicable ownership interests in remarketed
    pledged Notes and will be pledged to the Company to secure the
    holders’ obligation under the Purchase Contracts. On the
    Purchase Contract settlement date, a portion of the proceeds
    from the Treasury portfolio equal to the aggregate principal
    amount of the Notes that are components of the Convertible
    Preferred Units at the time of remarketing will automatically be
    applied to satisfy the holders’ obligations to purchase
    Convertible Preferred Stock under the Purchase Contracts. In
    addition, proceeds from the Treasury portfolio equal to the
    interest payment (assuming no reset of the interest rate) that
    would have been attributable to the Notes that were components
    of the Convertible Preferred Units at the time of remarketing
    will be paid on the Purchase Contract settlement date to the
    holders.

If a trigger event occurs prior to the first day in the optional
    remarketing window, all Purchase Contracts will mandatorily
    settle early on the date that is 25 calendar days after the
    occurrence of the trigger event or, if such day is not a
    business day, the immediately following business day (the
    “triggered early settlement date”). In connection with
    the occurrence of a trigger event, the remarketing agent will
    remarket the Notes that are components of the units and any
    separate Notes whose holders have elected to participate in the
    remarketing during each day of the five business day period (the
    “triggered early remarketing period”) ending on the
    third business day immediately preceding the triggered early
    settlement date (the “triggered early remarketing”). A
    “trigger event” will be deemed to have occurred upon
    the Company’s filing any periodic or annual report under
    Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    as amended, in respect of any fiscal quarter with financial
    statements for such fiscal quarter where the Company’s
    leverage ratio (as described in the prospectus supplement
    relating to the Convertible Preferred Units) is equal to or
    greater than 6.0 (on an annualized basis) for each of the three
    consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding, and
    including, such fiscal quarter.

Unless the Treasury portfolio has replaced the pledged Notes as
    part of Convertible Preferred Units as a result of a successful
    optional remarketing or a triggered early settlement date has
    occurred, the remarketing agent will remarket the pledged Notes
    that are components of the Convertible Preferred Units and any
    separate Notes whose holders have elected to participate in the
    remarketing during each day of the five business day



period ending on November 12, 2015 (the third business day
    immediately preceding the Purchase Contract settlement date)
    until the remarketing is successful (the “final
    remarketing”).

In connection with a successful remarketing, all outstanding
    Notes (whether or not remarketed) will rank senior to all of the
    Company’s existing and future unsecured junior subordinated
    obligations and junior to all of its existing and future senior
    indebtedness, the interest deferral provisions of the Notes will
    not apply to all outstanding Notes (whether or not remarketed),
    the interest rate on all outstanding Notes (whether or not
    remarketed) may be reset and interest will be payable
    semi-annually in arrears.

There was $4.5 million in interest expense recorded for
    2010 related to the contractual interest coupon on the Notes for
    the periods presented based upon the 4.25% rate.

Equity
    Option:

In order to offset the common shares that may be deliverable
    upon conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, the
    Company entered into capped call transactions (equity options)
    with certain major financial institutions (the “capped call
    counterparties”). The capped call transactions cover,
    subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of
    common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock
    underlying the maximum number of shares of Convertible Preferred
    Stock issuable upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts. Each
    of the capped call transactions has a term of approximately five
    years and initially has a lower strike price of $75.00, which
    corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Convertible
    Preferred Stock, and an upper strike price of $97.95, which is
    approximately 60% higher than the closing price of the common
    stock on November 1, 2010. The Company paid
    $50.3 million of cash to fund the cost of the capped call
    transactions, which was recorded as a reduction of
    Shareowners’ Equity. The capped call transactions may be
    settled by net share settlement or, at the Company’s option
    and subject to certain conditions, cash settlement, physical
    settlement or modified physical settlement (in which case the
    number of shares the Company will receive will be reduced by a
    number of shares based on the excess, if any, of the
    volume-weighted average price of its common stock, as measured
    under the terms of the capped call transactions, over the upper
    strike price of the capped call transactions). If the capped
    call transactions are exercised and the volume-weighted average
    price per share of common stock, as measured under the terms of
    the capped call transactions, is greater than the lower strike
    price of the capped call transactions but not greater than the
    upper strike price of the capped call transactions, then the
    value the Company expects to receive from the capped call
    counterparties will be generally based on the amount of such
    excess. As a result, the capped call transactions may offset the
    potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred
    Stock. If, however, the volume-weighted average price per share
    of common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call
    transactions, exceeds the upper strike price of the capped call
    transactions, the value the Company expects to receive upon the
    exercise of the capped call transactions (or portions thereof)
    will be approximately equal to (x) the excess of the upper
    strike price of the capped call transactions over the lower
    strike price of the capped call transactions times (y) the
    number of shares of common stock relating to the capped call
    transactions (or the portions thereof) being exercised, in each
    case as determined under the terms of the capped call
    transactions. As a result, the dilution mitigation under the
    capped call transactions will be limited based on such capped
    value.

Junior
    Subordinated Debt Securities

In November 2005, the Company issued $450.1 million of
    junior subordinated debt securities to The Stanley Works Capital
    Trust I (the “Trust”), with a

40-year

term
    and a fixed initial coupon rate of 5.902% for the first five
    years.

The Trust, which was not consolidated in accordance with

ASC 470-20,

obtained the funds it loaned to the Company through the capital
    market sale of $450.0 million of Enhanced
    Trust Preferred Securities (“ETPS”) and through
    the sale of $0.1 million in Trust Common Securities to
    the Company. The obligations, tenor and terms of the ETPS
    mirrored those of the junior subordinated debt securities. The
    securities may be redeemed after five years without penalty. If
    not redeemed after 5 years, the coupon rate will reset
    quarterly to 1.4% plus the highest of

3-month

LIBOR, the

10-Year

US
    Treasury CMT or the

30-Year

US
    Treasury CMT, limited



to a maximum rate of 13.25%. Net proceeds of the issuance were
    used to partially finance the acquisitions of Facom
    (January 1, 2006) and National (November 30,
    2005).

In October 2008, the Company repurchased $34.3 million of
    the ETPS for $24.9 million in cash, and in December 2008
    the Trust was dissolved. Upon the dissolution of the Trust, the
    $0.1 million investment in the unconsolidated Trust was
    unwound with a corresponding reduction in debt. Additionally the
    Company caused the remaining $415.7 million of junior
    subordinated debt securities held by the Trust to be distributed
    to the holders of ETPS in exchange for the ETPS upon dissolution
    of the Trust. A pre-tax gain of $9.4 million was recognized
    pertaining to the partial extinguishment of this debt.

In May 2009, the Company repurchased $103.0 million of its
    junior subordinated debt securities for $58.7 million in
    cash. The pre-tax gain recorded associated with this
    extinguishment was $43.8 million, and the principal balance
    of the debt after this extinguishment and at January 2,
    2010 was $312.7 million.

In December 2010, the Company redeemed the remaining junior
    subordinated debt at par without penalty.

Financing
    of the January 2007 HSM Acquisition

During 2007, the Company initially funded the
    $546.1 million HSM acquisition with a combination of
    short-term borrowings and cash. A $500.0 million

364-day

revolving credit bridge facility was entered into on
    January 8, 2007, of which $130.0 million was utilized
    to acquire HSM; the remainder of the HSM purchase price was
    funded through commercial paper borrowings and cash.

On March 20, 2007, the Company completed two security
    offerings: “Equity Units”, which consisted of
    $330.0 million of convertible debt and $330.0 million
    of forward stock purchase contracts and $200.0 million of
    unsecured notes (the “2010 Term Notes”). The
    $488.1 million net cash proceeds of these offerings and the
    related financial instruments described below were used to pay
    down the short-term bridge facility and commercial paper
    borrowings.

The 2010 Term Notes matured March 15, 2010.

Equity Units:

On March 20, 2007, the
    Company issued 330,000 Equity Units, each with a stated value of
    $1,000. The Equity Units are comprised of a senior convertible
    note (a “Convertible Note”) and a forward common stock
    purchase contract (an “Equity Purchase Contract”). The
    Company received $320.1 million in cash proceeds from the
    Equity Units offering, net of underwriting fees. These proceeds
    were used to repay short-term borrowings and, along with
    $18.8 million in proceeds from the sale of stock warrants,
    to fund the $49.3 million cost of the convertible notes
    hedge as more fully described below.

In November 2008, the Company repurchased $10.0 million of
    the Equity Units for $5.3 million in cash (the “$10
    Million Repurchase”). To properly account for the
    transaction, the Equity Unit elements were bifurcated as
    effectively the Company paid $10.0 million to extinguish
    the Convertible Notes and received $4.7 million from the
    seller to settle its obligation under the Equity Purchase
    Contracts. As further detailed below, the Equity Purchase
    Contracts obligated the holder to purchase shares of the
    Company’s common stock on May 17, 2010. At the
    November 2008 repurchase date, the Company’s common stock
    had a closing market value of $25.38. The remaining liability
    for Contract Adjustment Payment fees, as defined below,
    associated with the $10.0 million of settled Equity
    Purchase Contracts was reversed, resulting in an increase to
    equity of $0.7 million. The related $10.0 million in
    Convertible Note Hedges (the “Bond Hedge”) and Stock
    Warrants were unwound with a nominal impact to equity. As a
    result of the $10 Million Repurchase, there was an insignificant
    gain recorded in earnings and a net increase in equity of
    $5.4 million.

Equity
    Purchase Contracts:

The Equity Purchase Contracts obligated the holders to purchase
    on May 17, 2010, newly issued shares of the Company’s
    common stock for $320.0 million in cash. Pursuant to that
    obligation 5,180,776 shares of common stock were issued on
    the May 17, 2010 settlement date.

Holders of the Equity Purchase Contract were paid a quarterly
    contract adjustment payment (“Contract Adjustment
    Payment”) of 5.125% per annum, and the first payment
    thereof was made August 17, 2007. The



$49.6 million present value of the Contract Adjustment
    Payments reduced Shareowners’ Equity at inception. As each
    quarterly Contract Adjustment Payment was made, the related
    liability was relieved with the difference between the cash
    payment and the present value of the Contract Adjustment Payment
    recorded as interest expense (at inception approximately
    $3.9 million accretion over the three year term). Due to
    the $10 Million Repurchase, $0.7 million in remaining
    liability for the related Contract Adjustment Payments was
    reversed. The Company’s obligation to make Contract
    Adjustment Payments was satisfied in May 2010; therefore at
    January 1, 2011 the company reported no further liability
    for Contract Adjustment Payments under the terms of the Equity
    Purchase Contracts.

Convertible
    Notes:

The $320.0 million Convertible Notes principal amount
    currently outstanding has a five-year, two month maturity and is
    due May 17, 2012. At maturity, the Company is obligated to
    repay the principal in cash, and may elect to settle the
    conversion option value, if any, as detailed further below, in
    either cash or shares of the Company’s common stock. The
    Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR minus 3.5%, reset quarterly (but never less than zero),
    and initially set at 1.85%. Interest is payable quarterly
    commencing August 17, 2007. The Convertible Notes are
    unsecured general obligations and rank equally with all of the
    Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The
    Convertible Notes were pledged as collateral to guarantee the
    holders’ obligations to purchase common stock under the
    terms of the Equity Purchase Contract described above. The
    unamortized discount of the Convertible Notes was $14.9 and
    $25.5 million at January 1, 2011 and January 2,
    2010, respectively. The remaining unamortized balance will be
    recorded to interest expense through the Convertible Notes
    maturity in May 2012. The equity component carrying value was
    $32.9 million at January 1, 2011 and January 2,
    2010.

In May 2010, the Company completed the contractually required
    remarketing of the $320.0 million of Convertible Notes.
    Holders of $8.7 million of the Convertible Notes elected to
    participate in the remarketing. Following the remarketing, the
    Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of
    3 — month LIBOR minus 3.5%, rest quarterly (but not
    less than zero).

The conversion premium for the Convertible Notes is 19.0%,
    equivalent to the conversion price of $64.34 based on the $54.06
    value of the Company’s common stock (as adjusted for
    standard anti-dilution provisions). Upon conversion on
    May 17, 2012 (or a cash merger event), the Company will
    deliver to each holder of the Convertible Notes $1,000 cash for
    the principal amount of the note. Additionally at conversion, to
    the extent, if any, that the conversion option is “in the
    money”, the Company will deliver, at its election, either
    cash or shares of the Company’s common stock based on a
    conversion rate of 15.5425 shares (equivalent to the
    conversion price set at $64.34) and the applicable market value
    of the Company’s common stock. The ultimate conversion rate
    will be increased above 15.5425 shares in accordance with
    standard anti-dilution provisions applicable to the Convertible
    Notes or in the event of a cash merger. An increase in the
    ultimate conversion rate will apply to the extent that the
    Company increases the per share common stock dividend rate
    during the five year term of the Convertible Notes; accordingly
    such changes to the conversion rate are within the
    Company’s control under its discretion regarding dividends
    it may declare. Also, the holders may elect to accelerate
    conversion, and “make whole” adjustments to the
    conversion rate may apply, in the event of a cash merger or
    “fundamental change”. Subject to the foregoing, if the
    market value of the Company’s common shares is below the
    conversion price at conversion, (set at a rate equating to
    $64.34 per share), the conversion option would be “out of
    the money” and the Company would have no obligation to
    deliver any consideration beyond the $1,000 principal payment
    required under each of the Convertible Notes. To the extent,
    that the conversion option of the Convertible Notes becomes
    “in the money” in any interim period prior to
    conversion, there will be a related increase in diluted shares
    outstanding utilized in the determination of the Company’s
    diluted earnings per share in accordance with the treasury stock
    method prescribed by ASC 260. The conversion option was
    “in the money” as of January 1, 2011 and had a
    very minor dilutive impact during the year. As of
    January 2, 2010, the conversion option was “out of the
    money.”

There was no interest expense recorded for 2010 and 2009 related
    to the contractual interest coupon on the Convertible Notes for
    the periods presented based upon the applicable

3-month

LIBOR minus 3.5% rate in these periods. The Company had
    derivative contracts fixing the interest rate on the
    $320.0 million floating rate



Convertible Notes

(3-month

LIBOR less 350 basis points) at 1.43% and recognized
    $1.6 million and $4.8 million of interest expense
    pertaining to these interest rate swaps for the years ended
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010. The non-cash
    interest expense accretion related to the amortization of the
    liability balance as required by the accounting standards
    totaled $10.5 million for 2010 and $10.2 million for
    2009. The total interest expense recognized on the Convertible
    Notes reflecting the contractual interest coupon, the fixed
    interest rate swaps and the interest accretion required by the
    accounting standards represented an effective interest rate of
    4.08% for the period ended January 1, 2011 and 5.2% for the
    period ended January 2, 2010.

Convertible Notes Hedge:

In order to offset
    the common shares that may be deliverable pertaining to the
    previously discussed conversion option feature of the
    Convertible Notes, the Company entered into Bond Hedges with
    certain major financial institutions. The Company paid the
    financial institutions a premium of $49.3 million for the
    Bond Hedge which was recorded, net of $14.0 million of
    anticipated tax benefits, as a reduction of Shareowners’
    equity. The terms of the Bond Hedge mirror those of the
    conversion option feature of the Convertible Notes such that the
    financial institutions may be required to deliver shares of the
    Company’s common stock to the Company upon conversion at
    its exercise in May 2012. To the extent, that the conversion
    option feature becomes “in the money” during the five
    year term of the Convertible Notes, diluted shares outstanding
    will increase accordingly. Because the Bond Hedge is
    anti-dilutive, it will not be included in any diluted shares
    outstanding computation prior to its maturity. However, at
    maturity of the Convertible Notes and the Bond Hedge in 2012,
    the aggregate effect of these instruments is that there will be
    no net increase in the Company’s common shares.

Stock Warrants:

Simultaneously, the Company
    issued 5,092,956 of unregistered common stock warrants
    (“Stock Warrants”) to financial institutions for
    $18.8 million. The cash proceeds received were recorded as
    an increase to Shareowners’ equity. The Stock Warrants are
    exercisable during the period August 17, 2012 through
    September 28, 2012, and have a strike price of $86.50
    established at 160% of the market value of $54.06 (as adjusted
    for standard

anti-dilution

provisions). The Stock Warrants will be net share settled and
    are deemed to automatically be exercised at their expiration
    date if they are “in the money” and were not
    previously exercised. The strike price for the Stock Warrants
    will be adjusted for increases to the Company’s dividend
    rate per share, or special dividends, if any, that occur during
    their five year term (consistent with the standard anti-dilution
    provisions discussed earlier with respect to the conversion
    spread on the Convertible Notes). In the event the Stock
    Warrants become “in the money” during their five year
    term due to the market value of the Company’s common stock
    exceeding the strike price, there will be a related increase in
    diluted shares outstanding utilized in the determination of the
    Company’s diluted earnings per share. In November 2008,
    154,332 Stock Warrants were repurchased from the financial
    institutions at a cost of $0.15 per warrant, pertaining to the
    previously mentioned $10 Million Repurchase. As a result, there
    were 4,938,624 Stock Warrants Outstanding as of January 1,
    2011.

I.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices and
    commodity prices. As part of the Company’s risk management
    program, a variety of financial instruments such as interest
    rate swaps, currency swaps, purchased currency options, foreign
    exchange contracts and commodity contracts, are used to mitigate
    interest rate exposure, foreign currency exposure and commodity
    price exposure.

Financial instruments are not utilized for speculative purposes.
    If the Company elects to do so and if the instrument meets the
    criteria specified in ASC 815, management designates its
    derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or
    net investment hedges. Generally, commodity price exposures are
    not hedged with derivative financial instruments and instead are
    actively managed through customer pricing initiatives,
    procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives and other
    productivity improvement projects. In the first quarter of 2010,
    the Company acquired a portfolio of derivative financial
    instruments in conjunction with the Merger, which
    Black & Decker entered into in the ordinary course of
    business. At the March 12, 2010 merger date, the Company
    established its intent for each derivative. The Company
    terminated all outstanding interest rate swaps and foreign
    currency forwards hedging future purchases of inventory
    denominated in a foreign currency. For other foreign currency
    forwards and commodity derivatives, the Company elected to leave
    the instruments



in place as an economic hedge only and account for them as
    undesignated. Net investment hedges were re-designated.

A summary of the fair value of the Company’s derivatives
    recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows (in
    millions):

The counterparties to all of the above mentioned financial
    instruments are major international financial institutions. The
    Company is exposed to credit risk for net exchanges under these
    agreements, but not for the notional amounts. The credit risk is
    limited to the asset amounts noted above. The Company limits its
    exposure and concentration of risk by contracting with diverse
    financial institutions and does not anticipate non-performance
    by any of its counterparties. Further, as more fully discussed
    in Note M, Fair Value Measurements, the Company considers
    non-performance risk of its counterparties at each reporting
    period and adjusts the carrying value of these assets
    accordingly. The risk of default is considered remote.

In 2010, significant cash flows related to derivatives including
    those that are separately discussed in Cash Flow Hedges, Net
    Investment Hedges and Undesignated Hedges below resulted in net
    cash paid of $64.0 million. The Company also received
    $30.1 million in March 2010 from the termination of
    $325.0 million notional of fixed to variable interest rate
    swaps that became undesignated at the merger date and as a
    result the cash inflow was reported within investing activities
    in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

In 2009, significant cash flows related to derivatives included
    cash payments of $15.5 million on a Great Britain pound
    currency swap maturity and a Canadian dollar swap termination;
    both of these swaps were classified as undesignated.

CASH FLOW HEDGES —

There was a
    $50.2 million after-tax loss as of January 1, 2011 and
    a $4.8 million after-tax gain as of January 2, 2010
    and January 3, 2009 reported for cash flow hedge
    effectiveness in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. An
    after-tax loss of $13.3 million is expected to be
    reclassified to earnings as the hedged transactions occur or as
    amounts are amortized within the next twelve months. The
    ultimate amount recognized will vary based on fluctuations of
    the hedged currencies and interest rates through the maturity
    dates.



The tables below detail pre-tax amounts reclassified from
    Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings for active
    derivative financial instruments during the periods in which the
    underlying hedged transactions affected earnings for the twelve
    months ended January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010 (in

For 2010, the hedged items’ impact to the consolidated
    statement of operations was a gain of $2.3 million in Cost
    of Sales and a loss of $8.5 million, in Other, net. For
    2009, the hedged items’ impact to the consolidated
    statement of operations was a loss of $4.7 million in Cost
    of Sales and a gain of $4.5 million, in Other, net. There
    was no impact related to the interest rate contracts’
    hedged items for any period presented. The impact of
    de-designated hedges was immaterial for all periods presented.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, an after-tax loss of
    $2.9 million, an after-tax loss of $1.1 million and an
    after-tax gain of $42.9 million, respectively, was
    reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into
    earnings (inclusive of the gain/loss amortization on terminated
    derivative financial instruments) during the periods in which
    the underlying hedged transactions affected earnings.

Interest Rate Contract:

The Company enters
    into interest rate swap agreements in order to obtain the lowest
    cost source of funds within a targeted range of variable to
    fixed-rate debt proportions. At January 1, 2011, the
    Company had $400 million of forward starting swaps
    outstanding fixing the interest rate on the expected refinancing
    of debt in 2012 as discussed below. At January 2, 2010, the
    Company had outstanding contracts fixing the interest rate on
    its $320.0 million floating rate convertible notes and
    $400 million of forward starting swaps outstanding fixing
    the interest rate on the expected refinancing of debt in 2012.

In May 2010, the Company executed forward starting interest rate
    swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million
    fixing interest at 3.95%. The objective of the hedge was to
    offset the expected variability on future payments associated
    with the interest rate on debt instruments. In connection with
    the August 31, 2010 issuance of the $400 million of
    senior unsecured 2040 Term Bonds, as discussed in Note H,
    Long Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, these
    forward-starting interest rate swaps were terminated. The
    terminations resulted in cash payments of $48.4 million.
    This loss ($30.0 million on an after-tax basis) was
    recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be
    amortized to earnings over the first ten years in which the
    interest expense related to the 2040 Term Bonds is recognized.
    The cash flows stemming from the termination of such interest
    rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are presented within
    financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

In December 2009, the Company executed forward starting interest
    rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of
    $400 million fixing 10 years of interest payments at
    4.78% beginning in November 2012. The objective of the hedge is
    to offset the expected variability on future payments associated
    with the interest rate on debt instruments expected to be issued
    in November 2012. Gains or losses on the swaps are recorded in
    Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be subsequently
    reclassified into earnings as the future interest

    These swaps have a mandatory early termination requirement in
    November 2012.

Foreign
    Currency Contracts

Forward contracts:

Through its global
    businesses, the Company enters into transactions and makes
    investments denominated in multiple currencies that give rise to
    foreign currency risk. The Company and its subsidiaries
    regularly purchase inventory from subsidiaries with

non-U.S. dollar

functional currencies which creates currency-related volatility
    in the Company’s results of operations. The Company
    utilizes forward contracts to hedge these forecasted purchases
    of inventory. Gains and losses reclassified from Accumulated
    other comprehensive loss for the effective and ineffective
    portions of the hedge as well as any amounts excluded from
    effectiveness testing are recorded in Cost of sales. At
    January 1, 2011, the notional value of the forward currency
    contracts outstanding was $114.8 million, of which
    $46.0 million has been de-designated, maturing at various
    dates through 2011. As of January 2, 2010, there were no
    such outstanding hedge contracts.

Currency swaps:

The Company and its
    subsidiaries have entered into various inter-company
    transactions whereby the notional values are denominated in
    currencies other than the functional currencies of the party
    executing the trade. In order to better match the cash flows of
    its inter-company obligations with cash flows from operations,
    the Company enters into currency swaps. In November 2010,
    currency swaps with a notional value of $150 million
    matured resulting in cash payments of $23.7 million. There
    were no outstanding currency swaps designated as cash flow
    hedges at January 1, 2011. The notional value of currency
    swaps was $150 million at January 2, 2010.

Purchased Option Contracts:

The Company and
    its subsidiaries have entered into various inter-company
    transactions whereby the notional values are denominated in
    currencies other than the functional currencies of the party
    executing the trade. In order to better match the cash flows of
    its inter-company obligations with cash flows from operations,
    the Company enters into purchased option contracts. Gains and
    losses reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss
    for the effective and ineffective portions of the hedge as well
    as any amounts excluded from effectiveness testing are recorded
    in Cost of sales. At January 1, 2011, the notional value of
    option contracts outstanding was $82.3 million, of which
    $36.4 million has been de-designated, maturing at various
    dates through 2011. As of January 2, 2010, there were no
    such outstanding option contracts.

FAIR
    VALUE HEDGES

Interest Rate Risk:

In an effort to optimize
    the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt in the Company’s
    capital structure, the Company enters into interest rate swaps.
    In December 2010, the Company entered into interest rate
    swaps with notional values which equaled the Company’s
    $300 million 4.75% notes due in 2014 and
    $300 million 5.75% notes due in 2016. In January 2009,
    the Company entered into interest rate swaps with notional
    values which equaled the Company’s $200 million
    4.9% notes due in 2012 and $250 million
    6.15% notes due in 2013. These interest rate swaps
    effectively converted the Company’s fixed rate debt to
    floating rate debt based on LIBOR, thereby hedging the
    fluctuation in fair value resulting from changes in interest
    rates. The changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps were
    recognized in earnings as well as the offsetting changes in fair
    value of the underlying notes. The notional value of open
    contracts was $1.050 billion and $450 million as of
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, respectively. A
    summary of the fair value adjustments relating to these swaps is
    as follows (in millions):

In addition to the amounts in the table above, the net swap
    accruals for each period and amortization of the gains on
    terminated swaps are also reported in interest expense and
    totaled $12.7 million and $11.6 million for



2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest expense on the underlying
    debt was $28.3 million and $25.2 million for 2010 and
    2009, respectively.

During 2008, the Company had interest rate swaps identical to
    the $200 million and $250 million swaps discussed
    above that were terminated in December 2008, resulting in
    pre-tax gains of $16.5 million, offset by the fair value
    adjustment to the carrying value of the underlying notes. At
    January 3, 2009 the carrying amounts of the
    $200 million and $250 million notes were increased by
    $8.4 million and $7.7 million respectively, related to
    this adjustment and are being amortized over the remaining term
    of the notes as a reduction of interest expense.

NET
    INVESTMENT HEDGES

Foreign Exchange Contracts:

The Company
    utilizes net investment hedges to offset the translation
    adjustment arising from re-measurement of its investment in the
    assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries. The total
    after-tax amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive loss were
    losses of $32.7 million and $11.8 million at
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, respectively. As
    of January 1, 2011, the Company had foreign exchange
    contracts that mature in March 2011 with notional values
    totaling $223.1 million outstanding hedging a portion of
    its euro denominated net investment and foreign exchange
    contracts that mature at various dates through April 2011 with
    notional values of $800.9 million outstanding hedging a
    portion of its pound sterling denominated net investment. As of
    January 2, 2010, the Company had one foreign exchange
    contract with a notional value of $223.4 million
    outstanding hedging a portion of its euro denominated net
    investment The Company had foreign exchange contracts mature in
    2010 resulting in cash receipts of $43.9 million and cash
    payments of $29.0 million. Gains and losses on net
    investment hedges remain in Accumulated other comprehensive loss
    until disposal of the underlying assets. The details of the

UNDESIGNATED
    HEDGES

Foreign Exchange Contracts:

Currency swaps and
    foreign exchange forward contracts are used to reduce risks
    arising from the change in fair value of certain foreign
    currency denominated assets and liabilities (such as affiliate
    loans, payables and receivables). The objective of these
    practices is to minimize the impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on operating results. The total notional amount of
    the contracts outstanding at January 1, 2011 was
    $2.3 billion of forward contracts and $219.4 million
    in currency swaps, maturing at various dates primarily through
    September 2011 with one currency swap maturing in December 2014.
    The total notional amount of the contracts outstanding at
    January 2, 2010 was $182.6 million of forward
    contracts and $160.5 million in currency swaps. Significant
    cash flows related to undesignated hedges during 2010 included
    net cash paid of $6.7 million. The income statement impacts

Commodity Contracts:

Commodity contracts were
    used to manage price risks related to material
    purchases — primarily zinc and copper — used
    in the manufacturing process. The objective of the contracts was
    to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the
    forecasted purchase of these commodities. In



conjunction with the Merger, the Company assumed commodity
    contracts with a total notional amount of 7.4 million
    pounds. During the second quarter of 2010, all commodity
    contracts matured or were terminated. No notional amounts were
    outstanding as of January 1, 2011. The income statement

    price of the Company’s common stock.

The Convertible Notes outstanding, described more fully in
    Note H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, had a
    very minor dilutive impact during the year.

As of January 1, 2011 there were no shares related to the
    Convertible Preferred Units included in the calculation of

PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS —

Each
    outstanding share of common stock has a one share purchase
    right. Each purchase right may be exercised to purchase one
    two-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $220.00, subject to
    adjustment. The rights, which do not have voting rights, expire
    on March 10, 2016, and may be redeemed by the Company at a
    price of $0.01 per right at any time prior to the tenth day
    following the public announcement that a person has acquired
    beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
    common stock. In the event that the Company is acquired in a
    merger or other business combination transaction, provision
    shall be made so that each holder of a right (other than a
    holder who is a 14.9%-or-more shareowner) shall have the right
    to receive, upon exercise thereof, that number of shares of
    common stock of the surviving Company having a market value
    equal to two times the exercise price of the right. Similarly,
    if anyone becomes the beneficial owner of more than 15% of the
    then outstanding shares of common stock (except pursuant to an
    offer for all



outstanding shares of common stock which the independent
    directors have deemed to be fair and in the best interest of the
    Company), provision will be made so that each holder of a right
    (other than a holder who is a 14.9%-or-more shareowner) shall
    thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof,
    common stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or
    other securities of the Company) having a market value equal to
    two times the exercise price of the right. At January 1,
    2011, there were 166,347,430 outstanding rights.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS —

The Company
    has stock-based compensation plans for salaried employees and
    non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The plans
    provide for discretionary grants of stock options, restricted
    stock units, and other stock-based awards.

The plans are generally administered by the Compensation and
    Organization Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of
    non-employee directors.

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted at
    the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of
    grant and have a

10-year

term. Generally, stock option grants vest ratably over four
    years from the date of grant.

One million options were granted in conjunction with the Merger.
    These options will cliff vest on the third anniversary of the
    Merger. The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
    Assumptions used for the Black-Scholes valuation of these
    options were:

$

16.34

The following describes how certain assumptions affecting the
    estimated fair value of stock options are determined: the
    dividend yield is computed as the annualized dividend rate at
    the date of grant divided by the strike price of the stock
    option; expected volatility is based on an average of the market
    implied volatility and historical volatility for the 5 year
    expected life; the risk-free interest rate is based on
    U.S. Treasury securities with maturities equal to the
    expected life of the option; and an eight percent forfeiture
    rate is assumed. The Company uses historical data in order to
    estimate forfeitures and holding period behavior for valuation
    purposes.

The fair value of other stock option grants made during the year
    was also estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions
    used for grants in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively: dividend
    yield of 2.1%, 2.8% and 3.8%; expected volatility of 32.7%,
    32.8% and 45.0%; and risk-free interest rates of 2.2%, 2.2% and
    1.8%. An expected life of 5.5 years was used in 2010 and an
    expected life of 5 years was used in both 2009 and 2008.
    Also, a weighted average vesting period of 2.5 years was
    used in 2010, 2.4 years in 2009 and 2.0 years in 2008.
    The weighted average fair value of stock options granted in
    2010, 2009 and 2008 was $17.00, $11.48 and $9.25, respectively.

Refer to Note E, Merger and Acquisitions, for discussion of
    the valuation of the options assumed from the Merger.

At January 1, 2011, the range of exercise prices on
    outstanding stock options was $23.22 to $74.11. Stock option
    expense was $17.7 million, $6.1 million and
    $4.8 million for the years ended January 1, 2011,
    January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, respectively.

At January 1, 2011, the Company had $44.9 million of
    unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense for stock options.
    This expense will be recognized over the remaining vesting
    periods which are 3.1 years on a weighted average basis.

During 2010, the Company received $59.9 million in cash
    from the exercise of stock options. The related tax benefit from
    the exercise of these options is $14.6 million. During
    2010, 2009 and 2008 the total intrinsic value of options
    exercised was $46.5 million, $16.5 million and
    $6.8 million, respectively. When options are exercised, the
    related shares are issued from treasury stock.

ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock
    Compensation,” requires the benefit arising from tax
    deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be
    classified as a financing cash flow. To quantify the recognized
    compensation cost on which the excess tax benefit is computed,
    both actual compensation expense recorded and pro-forma
    compensation cost reported in disclosures are considered. An
    excess tax benefit is generated on the extent to which the
    actual gain, or spread, an optionee receives upon exercise of an
    option exceeds the fair value determined at the grant date; that
    excess spread over the fair value of the option times the
    applicable tax rate represents the excess tax benefit. In 2010
    and 2009, the Company reported $10.8 million and
    $0.3 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits as a
    financing cash flow within the proceeds from issuance of common
    stock caption.

Compensation cost for new grants is recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period. The expense for
    retirement eligible employees (those aged 55 and over and with
    10 or more years of service) is recognized by the date they
    became retirement eligible, as such employees may retain their
    options for the 10 year contractual term in the event they
    retire prior to the end of the vesting period stipulated in the
    grant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

The Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) enables eligible
    employees in the United States and Canada to subscribe at any
    time to purchase shares of common stock on a monthly basis at
    the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the shares on the
    grant date ($37.53 per share for fiscal year 2010 purchases) or
    85% of the fair market value of the shares on the last business
    day of each month. A maximum of 6,000,000 shares are
    authorized for subscription. During 2010, 2009 and
    2008 shares totaling



143,624 shares, 115,776 shares and 62,261 shares
    respectively, were issued under the plan at average prices of
    $37.53, $27.87 and $37.31 per share, respectively and the
    intrinsic value of the ESPP purchases was $3.1 million,
    $1.8 million and $0.4 million respectively. For 2010,
    the Company received $5.4 million in cash from ESPP
    purchases, and there is no related tax benefit. The fair value
    of ESPP shares was estimated using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. ESPP compensation cost is recognized ratably over
    the one-year term based on actual employee stock purchases under
    the plan. The fair value of the employees’ purchase rights
    under the ESPP was estimated using the following assumptions for
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively: dividend yield of 2.5%, 2.9%
    and 3.7%; expected volatility of 38.0%, 56.0% and 28.0%;
    risk-free interest rates of 0.1%, 0.2% and 2.6%; and expected
    lives of one year. The weighted average fair value of those
    purchase rights granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $20.77,
    $10.77 and $9.02, respectively. Total compensation expense
    recognized for ESPP amounted to $3.5 million,
    $1.2 million and $0.6 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Restricted Share Units and
    Awards:

Compensation cost for restricted share
    units and awards, including restricted shares granted to French
    employees in lieu of RSU’s, (collectively
    “RSU’s”) granted to employees is recognized
    ratably over the vesting term, which varies but is generally
    4 years. RSU grants totaled 1,532,107 shares,
    452,613 shares and 241,036 shares in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value
    of RSU’s granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $59.32, $37.55
    and $35.28 per share, respectively. Total compensation expense
    recognized for RSU’s amounted to $52.7 million,
    $9.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The
    actual tax benefit received in the period the shares were
    delivered was $0.3 million, $0.1 million and
    $2.1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of
    January 1, 2011, unrecognized compensation expense for
    RSU’s amounted to $70.9 million and this cost will be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.0 years.

As discussed in Note E, Merger and Acquisitions, the
    Company assumed 0.4 million restricted stock units and
    awards as part of the Merger. Accordingly, the Company expensed
    $4.3 million in stock-based compensation for the twelve
    months ended January 1, 2011, respectively, related to
    these awards.

A summary of non-vested restricted stock unit activity as of
    January 1, 2011, and changes during the twelve month period
    then ended is as follows:

    $7.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

Non-employee members of the Board of Directors received
    restricted share-based grants which must be cash settled and
    accordingly

mark-to-market

accounting is applied. Additionally, the Board of Directors were
    granted restricted share units for which compensation expense of
    $0.9 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million was
    recognized for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Long-Term Performance Awards:

The Company has
    granted Long Term Performance Awards (“LTIPs”) under
    its 1997, 2001 and 2009 Long Term Incentive Plans to senior
    management employees for achieving Company performance measures.
    Awards are payable in shares of common stock, which may be
    restricted if the employee has not achieved certain stock
    ownership levels, and generally no award is made if the employee
    terminates employment prior to the payout date.



Long-Term Performance Awards:

Two LTIP grants
    were made in 2009 and 2010. Both the grants have separate annual
    performance goals for each year within the respective three year
    performance period. Earnings per share and return on capital
    employed represent 75% of the share payout of each grant. There
    is a third market-based element, representing 25% of the total
    grant, which measures the Company’s common stock return
    relative to peers over the performance period. The ultimate
    delivery of shares will occur in 2012 and 2013 for the 2009 and
    2010 grants, respectively. Total payouts are based on actual
    performance in relation to these goals.

Working capital incentive plan:

In 2010, the
    Company initiated a bonus program under its 2009 Long Term
    Incentive Plan. The program provides executives the opportunity
    to receive stock in the event certain working capital turn
    objectives are achieved by June of 2013 and are sustained for a
    period of at least six months. The ultimate issuances of shares,
    if any, will be determined based on achievement of objectives
    during the performance period.

Expense recognized for the various performance-contingent grants
    amounted to $10.3 million in 2010, $3.4 million in
    2009 and $1.9 million in 2008. With the exception of the
    market-based award, in the event performance goals are not met
    compensation cost is not recognized and any previously
    recognized compensation cost is reversed.

EQUITY OPTION

In November 2010, the Company
    purchased from financial institutions over the counter

5-year

capped call options on 8.43 million shares of its common
    stock for an aggregate premium of $50.3 million, or an
    average of $5.97 per option. In accordance with

ASC 815-40

the premium paid was recorded as a reduction to equity. The gain
    or loss on the options will depend on the actual market price of
    the Company’s stock on exercise dates which occur in
    December 2015. The contracts for each of the three series of
    options generally provide that the options may, at the
    Company’s election, be cash settled, physically settled or
    net-share settled (the default settlement method). Each series
    of options has various expiration dates within the month of
    December 2015. The options will be automatically exercised if
    the market price of the Company’s common stock on the
    relevant expiration date is greater than the applicable lower
    strike price (i.e. the options are

“in-the-money”).

If the market price of the Company’s common stock at the
    expiration date is below the applicable lower strike price, the
    relevant options will expire with no value. If the market price
    of the Company’s common stock on the relevant expiration
    date is between the applicable lower and upper strike prices,
    the value per option to the Company will be the then-current
    market price less that lower strike price. If the market price
    of the Company’s common stock is above the applicable upper
    strike price, the value per option to the Company will be the
    difference between the applicable upper strike price and lower
    strike price. The aggregate fair value of the options at
    January 1, 2011 was $51.2 million.

In January 2009, the Company purchased from financial
    institutions over the counter 15 month capped call options,
    subject to adjustments for standard anti-dilution provisions, on
    3 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate
    premium of $16.4 million, or an average of $5.47 per
    option. The purpose of the capped call options is to reduce
    share price volatility on potential future share repurchases by
    establishing the prices at which the Company may elect to
    repurchase 3 million shares in the 15 month term. In
    accordance with

ASC 815-40

the premium paid was recorded as a reduction to
    Shareowners’ equity. The contracts for each of the three
    series of options generally provide that the options may, at the
    Company’s election, be cash settled, physically settled or
    net-share settled (the default settlement method). Each series
    of options had various expiration dates within the month of
    March 2010.

In 2009, the Company and counterparties to the transaction
    agreed to terminate 2,886,629 options. Of these terminations,
    886,629 were cash settled using an average share price of
    $41.29, resulting in a $7.2 million cash receipt and
    2,000,000 options were net-share settled in 1.0 million
    tranches using an average share price of $49.67 and $49.32,
    respectively. These terminations resulted in 513,277 shares
    being delivered to the Company which was recorded to
    Shareowners’ equity. Because the market price of the
    Company’s common stock was above the applicable upper
    strike price, the value per option to the Company was the
    difference between the applicable upper strike price and lower
    strike price. The remaining 113,371 options were automatically
    exercised and net-share settled in March 2010 using an average
    share price of $58.76 and a fair value of $1,673,265.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (“ESOP

”) Most
    U.S. employees, aside from Black & Decker
    employees, may contribute from 1% to 15% of their eligible
    compensation to a tax-deferred 401(k) savings plan, subject to
    restrictions under tax laws. Employees generally direct the
    investment of their own contributions into various investment
    funds. In 2010 and 2008, an employer match benefit was provided
    under the plan equal to one-half of each employee’s
    tax-deferred contribution up to the first 7% of their
    compensation. In 2009, an employer match benefit was provided
    under the plan equal to one-quarter of each employee’s
    tax-deferred contribution up to the first 7% of their
    compensation. Participants direct the entire employer match
    benefit such that no participant is required to hold the
    Company’s common stock in their 401(k) account. The
    employer match benefit totaled $8.8 million,
    $3.9 million and $10.4 million, in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. In addition to the regular employer match,
    in 2009 the Company made an additional $0.9 million
    contribution to employees’ accounts based on 2009
    forfeitures and a surplus resulting from appreciation of the
    Company’s share value.



In addition, approximately 3,300 U.S. salaried and
    non-union hourly employees are eligible to receive a
    non-contributory benefit under the Cornerstone plan. Cornerstone
    benefit allocations range from 3% to 9% of eligible employee
    compensation based on age. Approximately 1,100
    U.S. employees are eligible to receive an additional
    average 1.6% contribution actuarially designed to replace
    previously curtailed pension benefits. Allocations for benefits
    earned under the Cornerstone plan, which were suspended in 2009,
    were $13.7 million in 2010 and $15.6 million in 2008.
    Assets held in participant Cornerstone accounts are invested in
    target date retirement funds which have an age-based allocation
    of investments.

Shares of the Company’s common stock held by the ESOP were
    purchased with the proceeds of external borrowings in 1989 and
    borrowings from the Company in 1991 (“1991 internal
    loan”). The external ESOP borrowings, which were fully
    repaid in 2009, were guaranteed by the Company and were included
    in Long-term debt. Shareowners’ equity reflects a reduction
    equal to the cost basis of unearned (unallocated) shares
    purchased with the internal and the external borrowings.

The Company accounts for the ESOP under

ASC 718-40,

“Compensation — Stock Compensation —
    Employee Stock Ownership Plans”. Net ESOP activity
    recognized is comprised of the cost basis of shares released,
    the cost of the aforementioned Cornerstone and 401(k) match
    defined contribution benefits, interest expense on the external
    1989 borrowing, less the fair value of shares released and
    dividends on unallocated ESOP shares. The Company’s net
    ESOP activity resulted in expense of $3.4 million in 2010,
    income of $8.0 million in 2009 and expense of
    $10.6 million in 2008. ESOP expense is affected by the
    market value of the Company’s common stock on the monthly
    dates when shares are released. The market value of shares
    released averaged $58.56 per share in 2010, $39.37 per share in
    2009 and $43.65 per share in 2008.

Unallocated shares are released from the trust based on current
    period debt principal and interest payments as a percentage of
    total future debt principal and interest payments. Dividends on
    both allocated and unallocated shares may be used for debt
    service and to credit participant accounts for dividends earned
    on allocated shares. Dividends paid on the shares acquired with
    the 1991 internal loan were used solely to pay internal loan
    debt service in all periods. Dividends on ESOP shares, which are
    charged to shareowners’ equity as declared, were
    $9.7 million in 2010, $10.3 million in 2009 and
    $9.7 million in 2008, net of the tax benefit which is
    recorded within equity. Dividends on ESOP shares were utilized
    entirely for debt service in all years. Interest costs incurred
    by the ESOP on the 1989 external debt, which matured in 2009,
    amounted to $0.2 million in 2008 and were nominal in 2009.
    Interest costs incurred by the ESOP on the 1991 internal loan,
    which have no earnings impact, were $7.6 million,
    $8.1 million and $8.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Both allocated and unallocated ESOP shares are
    treated as outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per
    share. As of January 1, 2011, the cumulative number of ESOP
    shares allocated to participant accounts was 11,550,815, of
    which participants held 2,844,002 shares, and the number of
    unallocated shares was 4,014,241. At January 1, 2011, there
    were 31,553 released shares in the ESOP trust holding account
    pending allocation. The Company made cash contributions totaling
    $1.3 million in 2010, $11.4 million in 2009 and
    $15.6 million in 2008.

PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS

— The Company
    sponsors pension plans covering most domestic hourly and certain
    executive employees, and approximately 16,400 foreign employees.
    Benefits are generally based on salary and years of service,
    except for U.S. collective bargaining employees whose
    benefits are based on a stated amount for each year of service.

The Company contributes to multi-employer plans for certain
    collective bargaining U.S. employees. In addition, various
    other defined contribution plans are sponsored worldwide,
    including a tax-deferred 401(k) savings plan covering
    substantially all Black & Decker U.S. employees.
    The expense for such defined contribution plans, aside from the
    earlier discussed ESOP plans, follows:

During the fourth quarter of 2010, certain Black &
    Decker U.S. and U.K pension plans, as well as the
    U.S. retiree health benefit plan were curtailed resulting
    in curtailment gains of $20 million as disclosed in the
    tables above. In 2010, the increase in the U.S. projected
    benefit obligation from actuarial losses primarily pertains to
    the discount rate used to measure the pension liabilities along
    with investment experience for the



largest Black & Decker plan; these actuarial losses
    were largely recognized as part of the curtailment impact
    recorded for the plan such that there is no significant impact

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is
    determined considering the returns projected for the various
    asset classes and the relative weighting for each asset class as
    reflected in the target asset allocation below. In addition the
    Company considers historical performance, the opinions of
    outside actuaries and other data in developing the return
    assumption. The Company expects to use a weighted-average
    long-term rate of return assumption of 7.0% for both the
    U.S. and the

non-U.S. plans

in the determination of fiscal 2011 net periodic benefit
    expense.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS

— Plan assets are invested
    in equity securities, government and corporate bonds and other
    fixed income securities, money market instruments and insurance
    contracts. The Company’s



worldwide asset allocations at January 1, 2011 and
    January 2, 2010 by asset category and the level of the
    valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy established by
    ASC 820 are as follows:

U.S. and foreign equity securities primarily consist of
    companies with large market capitalizations and to a small
    extent mid and small capitalization securities. Government
    securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and foreign
    government securities with deminimus default risk. Corporate
    fixed income securities include publicly traded U.S. and
    foreign investment grade and high yield securities.
    Mortgage-backed securities predominantly consist of U.S.
    holdings. Assets held in insurance contracts are invested in the
    general asset pools of the various insurers, mainly debt and
    equity securities with guaranteed returns. Other investments
    include diversified private equity holdings.

The Company’s investment strategy for pension plan assets
    includes diversification to minimize interest and market risks,
    and generally does not involve the use of derivative financial
    instruments. Plan assets are rebalanced periodically to maintain
    target asset allocations. Currently, the Company’s target
    allocations include 50%-65% in equity securities, 35%-50% in
    fixed income securities and up to 10% in other securities.
    Maturities of investments are not necessarily related to the
    timing of expected future benefit payments, but adequate
    liquidity to make immediate and medium term benefit payments is
    ensured.

CONTRIBUTIONS

The Company’s funding
    policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts
    determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current
    and future benefits in accordance with federal law and other
    regulations. The Company expects to contribute approximately
    $140 million to its pension and other post-retirement
    benefit plans in 2011.

EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS

Benefit
    payments, inclusive of amounts attributable to estimated future
    employee service, are expected to be paid as follows over the
    next 10 years:

(Millions of Dollars)

These benefit payments will be funded through a combination of
    existing plan assets and amounts to be contributed in the future
    by the Company.



HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS

The weighted average
    annual assumed rate of increase in the per-capita cost of
    covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) is assumed
    to be 8.5% for 2011, reducing gradually to 4.5% by 2028 and
    remaining at that level thereafter. A one percentage point
    change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would affect
    the post-retirement benefit obligation as of January 1,
    2011 by approximately $3 million and would have an
    immaterial effect on the net periodic post-retirement benefit
    cost.

M.

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ASC 820 defines, establishes a consistent framework for
    measuring, and expands disclosure requirements about fair value.
    ASC 820 requires the Company to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect market data
    obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
    reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types
    of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 — Quoted prices for identical instruments
    in active markets.

Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments
    in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived
    valuations whose inputs and significant value drivers are
    observable.

Level 3 — Instruments that are valued using
    unobservable inputs.

The Company holds various derivative financial instruments that
    are employed to manage risks, including foreign currency and
    interest rate exposures. These financial instruments are carried
    at fair value and are included within the scope of ASC 820.
    The Company determines the fair value of derivatives through the
    use of matrix or model pricing, which utilizes verifiable inputs
    such as market interest and currency rates. When determining the
    fair value of these financial instruments for which Level 1
    evidence does not exist, the Company considers various factors
    including the following: exchange or market price quotations of
    similar instruments, time value and volatility factors, the
    Company’s own credit rating and the credit rating of the
    counter-party.

The following table presents the fair value and the hierarchy
    levels, for financial assets and liabilities that are measured
    at fair value on a recurring basis (millions of dollars):

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, long-lived
    assets with a carrying amount of $57.5 million were written
    down to $33.5 million fair value (approximately
    $30 million of which is included in the CDIY segment)
    during the year ended January 1, 2011. This was a result of
    restructuring-related asset impairments more fully described in
    Note O, Restructuring and Asset Impairments. Fair value for
    these impaired production assets was based on the present value
    of discounted cash flows. This included an estimate for future
    cash flows



as production activities are phased out as well as auction
    values (prices for similar assets) for assets where use has been
    discontinued or future cash flows are minimal.

A summary of the Company’s financial instruments carrying
    and fair values at January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010
    follows. Refer to Note I, Derivative Financial Instruments
    for more details regarding derivative financial instruments, and

The fair values of Long-term debt instruments are estimated
    using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the
    Company’s marginal borrowing rates. The fair values of
    foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements, comprising
    the derivative assets and liabilities in the table above, are
    based on current settlement values.

As discussed in Note B, Accounts and Financing Receivable,
    the Company has a deferred purchase price receivable related to
    sales of trade receivables. The deferred purchase price
    receivable will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected,
    generally within 30 days, and as such the carrying value of
    the receivable approximates fair value.

OTHER
    COSTS AND EXPENSES

charges primarily consisting of transaction costs, partially
    offset by pension curtailments and settlements.

Research and development costs, which are classified in
    SG&A, were $131.4 million, $18.3 million and
    $25.4 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

2010 Actions:

During 2010, the Company
    recognized $224.3 million of restructuring charges and
    asset impairments associated with the Black & Decker
    merger and acquisition of SSDS. Of those charges,
    $194.4 million relates to severance charges associated with
    the reduction of 3,000 employees, $20.2 million
    relates to asset impairments, $2.7 million relates to
    facility closure costs, and $7.0 million represents other
    charges.

In addition, the Company continued to initiate cost reduction
    actions in 2010 that were not associated with the
    Black & Decker merger and SSDS acquisition, resulting
    in severance and related charges of $11.4 million
    pertaining to the reduction of approximately 300 employees,
    and asset impairment charges of $3.8 million.

Of the $239.5 million recognized for these 2010 actions,
    $155.7 million has been utilized to date, with
    $84.4 million of reserves remaining as of January 1,
    2011, the majority of which are expected to be utilized in 2011.
    Usage includes $15.0 million the majority of which
    ultimately will entail cash payment in a future period as it
    relates to a defined benefit plan for severed Black &
    Decker executives which is classified in Post-Retirement
    Benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Pre-2010 Actions:

During 2009 and 2008 the
    Company initiated cost reduction actions in various businesses
    in response to sales volume declines associated with the
    economic recession. Charges recognized in 2010 associated with
    these initiatives amounted to $3.1 million.

As of January 2, 2010, the reserve balance related to these
    pre-2010 actions totaled $46.4 million. As a result of the
    Merger and the acquisition of SSDS, the Company has assumed
    $3.5 million of restructuring reserves recorded by those
    companies prior to the Merger and acquisition.

Utilization of the reserve balance related to Pre-2010 actions,
    including usage of those reserves acquired as part of the
    Merger, was $32.5 million in 2010. The remaining reserve
    balance of $16.8 million is expected to be utilized
    predominantly in 2011.

Segments:

The $242.6 million of charges
    recognized in 2010 includes: $126.4 million pertaining to
    the CDIY segment; $64.2 million pertaining to the Security
    segment; $12.2 million pertaining to the Industrial
    segment; and $39.8 million pertaining to non-operating
    entities.



In addition to the restructuring charges described in the
    preceding paragraphs, the Company recognized $21.4 million
    of restructuring-related costs in 2010 pertaining to the Merger.
    Those costs are classified in Cost of Sales and include
    accelerated depreciation and other charges associated with
    facility closures.

P.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

The Company classifies its business into three reportable
    segments: Construction & Do It Yourself
    (“CDIY”), Security, and Industrial.

The CDIY segment manufactures and markets hand tools, corded and
    cordless electric power tools and equipment, lawn and garden
    products, consumer portable power products, home products,
    accessories and attachments for power tools, plumbing products,
    consumer mechanics tools, storage systems, and pneumatic tools
    and fasteners. These products are sold to professional end
    users, distributors, and consumers, and are distributed through
    retailers (including home centers, mass merchants, hardware
    stores, and retail lumber yards).

The Security segment provides access and security solutions
    primarily for consumers, retailers, educational, financial and
    healthcare institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and
    industrial customers. The Company provides an extensive suite of
    mechanical and electronic security products and systems, and a
    variety of security services. These include security integration
    systems, software, related installation, maintenance, monitoring
    services, automatic doors, door closers, electronic keyless
    entry systems, exit devices, healthcare storage and supply chain
    solutions, patient protection products, hardware (including door
    and cabinet knobs and hinges, door stops, kick plates, house
    numbers, gate hardware, cabinet pulls, hooks, braces and shelf
    brackets), locking mechanisms, electronic keyless entry systems,
    keying systems, tubular and mortise door locksets. Security
    products are sold primarily on a direct sales basis, and in
    certain instances, through third party distributors.

The Industrial segment manufactures and markets professional
    industrial and automotive mechanics tools and storage systems,
    metal and plastic fasteners and engineered fastening systems,
    hydraulic tools and accessories, and specialty tools. These
    products are sold to industrial customers including automotive,
    transportation, electronics, aerospace, machine tool and
    appliance industries and distributed through third party
    distributors as well as through direct sales forces. As
    discussed in Note E, Merger and Acquisitions, in July 2010
    the Company completed the acquisition of CRC-Evans which is a
    full line supplier of specialized tools, equipment and services
    used in the construction of large diameter oil and natural gas
    transmission pipelines. CRC-Evans also sells and rents custom
    pipe handling and joint welding and coating equipment used in
    the construction of large and small diameter pipelines.
    CRC-Evans’ operations are presented within the Industrial
    segment and reflect activity since the acquisition date.

As discussed in Note E, Merger and Acquisitions, the
    Company merged with Black & Decker at the close of
    business on March 12, 2010. The Black & Decker
    businesses were assessed and integrated into the Company’s
    existing reportable segments. The legacy Black &
    Decker segments, Power Tools and Accessories,
    Hardware & Home Improvement (“HHI”) and
    Fastening and Assembly Systems, were integrated into the
    Company’s CDIY, Security and Industrial segments,
    respectively, with the Pfister plumbing products business which
    was formerly part of HHI included in the CDIY segment. The
    results of Black & Decker’s operations are
    presented within each of these segments and reflect activity
    since the merger date.

The Company utilizes segment profit, which is defined as net
    sales minus cost of sales and SG&A inclusive of the
    provision for doubtful accounts (aside from corporate overhead
    expense), and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to
    assess the profitability of each segment. Segment profit
    excludes the corporate overhead expense element of SG&A,
    interest income, interest expense,

other-net

(inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense),
    restructuring, and income tax expense. Refer to Note O,
    Restructuring and Asset Impairments for the amount of
    restructuring charges and asset impairments by segment, and to
    Note F, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for intangible
    amortization expense by segment. Corporate overhead is comprised
    of world headquarters facility expense, cost for the executive
    management team and cost for certain centralized functions that
    benefit the entire Company but are not directly attributable to
    the businesses, such as legal and corporate finance functions.
    Transactions between segments are not material. Segment assets



primarily include accounts receivable, inventory, other current
    assets, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and
    other miscellaneous assets.

Corporate assets and unallocated assets are cash and deferred
    income taxes. Geographic net sales and long-lived assets are
    attributed to the geographic regions based on the geographic
    location of each Company subsidiary.

The following information excludes the CST/berger laser leveling
    and measuring business, as well as three other smaller
    businesses, which are classified as discontinued operations as
    disclosed in Note T, Discontinued Operations, unless
    otherwise noted.

The Company recorded $173.5 million in cost of sales for
    the year ended January 1, 2011 associated with the
    inventory

step-up

amortization stemming from the turn of acquired inventory which
    was recorded in purchase accounting at its fair value. The
    non-cash inventory

step-up

    in CDIY, $24.9 million in Security and $23.3 million
    in Industrial for the year ended January 1, 2011.
    Additionally, the Company recorded $21.4 million of
    facility closure-related and other charges associated with the
    merger and other 2010 acquisitions of $1.8 million in CDIY,
    $18.1 million in Security and $2.0 million in
    Industrial for the year ended January 1, 2011.

Corporate overhead for the year ended January 1, 2011
    includes $81.0 million of charges pertaining primarily to
    certain merger-related executive compensation and
    Black & Decker integration costs.

Net operating loss carry forwards of $787.9 million as of
    January 1, 2011, are available to reduce future tax
    obligations of certain U.S. and foreign companies. The net
    operating loss carry forwards have various expiration dates
    beginning in 2011 with certain jurisdictions having indefinite
    carry forward periods. The U.S. federal capital loss carry
    forward of $85.1 million and U.S. foreign tax credit
    carry forwards of $11 million expire in 2015 and 2019,
    respectively.

A valuation allowance is recorded on certain deferred tax assets
    if it has been determined it is more likely than not that all or
    a portion of these assets will not be realized. We have recorded
    a valuation allowance of $265.8 million and
    $24.4 million for deferred tax assets existing as of
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, respectively.
    During 2010, the valuation allowance increased by
    $241.4 million principally due to the inclusion of
    Black & Decker during the year. The valuation
    allowance is primarily attributable to foreign and state net
    operating loss carry forwards and a U.S. federal capital
    loss carry forward.

The classification of deferred taxes as of January 1, 2011

    of $77.4 million relating to an NOL carry back, an audit
    settlement and a prior year overpayment. During 2010, the
    Company had tax holidays in Thailand and China. Tax holidays
    resulted in a reduction of tax expense amounting to
    $2.9 million in 2010, $2.0 million in 2009 and
    $2.7 million in 2008. The tax holiday in Thailand expired
    during 2010 while the tax holiday in China expires between 2011

Concurrent with the Merger, the Company has made a determination
    to repatriate $1,636.1 million of legacy Black &
    Decker foreign earnings, on which U.S. income taxes had not
    previously been provided. As a result of this repatriation
    decision, in conjunction with the purchase accounting under
    ASC 805, the Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities
    of approximately $442.9 million. All other undistributed
    foreign earnings of the Company at January 1, 2011, in the
    amount of $1,916.3 million, are considered to be
    permanently



reinvested, consistent with the Company’s overall growth
    strategy internationally, including acquisitions and long-term
    financial objectives. No provision has been made for taxes that
    might be payable upon remittance of these undistributed foreign
    earnings and determination of the amount of any unrecognized
    deferred tax liability is not practical.

The Company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits
    relate to U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The
    following table summarizes the activity related to the
    unrecognized tax benefits:

The gross unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2011 and
    January 2, 2010 includes $228 million and
    $26.1 million, respectively, of tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The liability
    for potential penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax
    benefits was decreased by $6.5 million in 2010, decreased
    by $1.2 million in 2009 and increased by $1.3 million
    in 2008. The liability for potential penalties and interest
    totaled $40.5 million as of January 1, 2011 and
    $4.4 million as of January 2, 2010. The Company
    classifies all tax-related interest and penalties as income tax
    expense. During the second quarter 2010, the Company recognized
    a tax benefit of $36 million attributable to a favorable
    settlement of certain tax contingencies, due to a change in
    facts and circumstances that did not exist at the acquisition
    date related to the resolution of a legacy Black &
    Decker income tax audit.

The Company considers many factors when evaluating and
    estimating our tax positions and the impact on income tax
    expense, which may require periodic adjustments and which may
    not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. It is reasonably
    possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with
    respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will
    significantly increase or decrease within the next
    12 months. These changes may be the result of settlement of
    ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters.
    At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible
    outcomes is $3 million to $8 million.

The Company is subject to the examination of its income tax
    returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
    authorities. For The Black & Decker Corporation, tax
    years 2004 and 2005 have been settled with the Internal Revenue
    Service as of January 1, 2011, tax years 2006 and 2007 are
    under current audit. For Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.
    tax years 2007 and forward remain subject to Internal Revenue
    Service examination. The Company also files many state and
    foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying
    statutes of limitations. Tax years 2007 and forward generally
    remain subject to examination by most state tax authorities. In
    significant foreign jurisdictions, tax years 2002 and forward
    generally remain subject to examination, while in Germany tax
    years 1999 and forward remain subject to examination.

COMMITMENTS
    AND GUARANTEES

COMMITMENTS —

The Company has non-cancelable
    operating lease agreements, principally related to facilities,
    vehicles, machinery and equipment. Minimum payments have not
    been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $1.8 million
    due in the future under non-cancelable subleases. Rental
    expense, net of sublease income, for operating leases was
    $157.0 million in 2010, $65.2 million in 2009 and
    $66.4 million in 2008.

Marketing and other commitments are comprised of:
    $51.1 million in marketing and advertising obligations,
    $7.8 million in utilities, $4.0 million in outsourcing
    and professional services and $8.9 million in other.

The Company has numerous assets, predominantly vehicles and
    equipment, under a one-year term U.S. master personal
    property lease. Residual value obligations under this master
    lease were $9.8 million at January 1, 2011 while the
    fair value of the underlying assets was approximately
    $11.3 million. The U.S. master personal property lease
    obligations are not reflected in the future minimum lease
    payments since the initial and remaining term does not exceed
    one year. The Company routinely exercises various lease renewal
    options and from time to time purchases leased assets for fair
    value at the end of lease terms.

The Company is a party to a synthetic lease for one of its major
    distribution centers. The program qualifies as an operating
    lease for accounting purposes, where only the monthly lease cost
    is recorded in earnings and the liability and value of
    underlying assets are off-balance sheet.

As of January 1, 2011, the estimated fair value of assets
    and remaining obligation for the property were
    $30.0 million and $25.5 million respectively.

The Company has guaranteed a portion of the residual value
    arising from its previously mentioned synthetic lease and
    U.S. master personal property lease programs. The lease
    guarantees aggregate $35.3 million while the fair value of
    the underlying assets is estimated at $41.3 million. The
    related assets would be available to satisfy the guarantee
    obligations and therefore it is unlikely the Company will incur
    any future loss associated with these lease guarantees.

The Company has issued $59.7 million in standby letters of
    credit that guarantee future payments which may be required
    under certain insurance programs.

The Company provides various limited and full recourse
    guarantees to financial institutions that provide financing to
    U.S. and Canadian Mac Tool distributors for their initial
    purchase of the inventory and truck necessary to function as a
    distributor. In addition, the Company provides limited and full
    recourse guarantees to financial institutions that extend credit
    to certain end retail customers of its U.S. Mac Tool
    distributors. The gross amount guaranteed in these arrangements
    is $16.9 million and the $12.7 million carrying value
    of the guarantees issued is recorded in debt and other
    liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company leases an aircraft under an operating lease that
    includes a $24.2 million residual value guarantee. The fair
    value of that aircraft is estimated at $39.5 million.

The Company provides product and service warranties which vary
    across its businesses. The types of warranties offered generally
    range from one year to limited lifetime, while certain products
    carry no warranty.



Further, the Company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to
    service its products in connection with product performance
    issues. Historical warranty and service claim experience forms
    the basis for warranty obligations recognized. Adjustments are
    recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes
    available.

CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings relating to
    environmental issues, employment, product liability,
    workers’ compensation claims and other matters. The Company
    periodically reviews the status of these proceedings with both
    inside and outside counsel, as well as an actuary for risk
    insurance. Management believes that the ultimate disposition of
    these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
    operations or financial condition taken as a whole.

In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed certain
    commitments and contingent liabilities. Black & Decker
    was involved in lawsuits in the ordinary course of business,
    which primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the
    use of Black & Decker’s products and allegations
    of patent and trademark infringement. Black & Decker
    also was involved in litigation and administrative proceedings
    involving employment matters, commercial disputes, and income
    tax matters. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive
    as well as compensatory damages. Additionally, Black &
    Decker is a party to litigation and administrative proceedings
    with respect to claims involving the discharge of hazardous
    substances into the environment. Some of these assert claims for
    damages and liability for remedial investigations and

clean-up

costs with respect to sites that have never been owned or
    operated by Black & Decker but at which
    Black & Decker has been identified as a potentially
    responsible party. Other matters involve current and former
    manufacturing facilities.

The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has
    provided an affiliate of Black & Decker a “Notice
    of Potential Liability” related to environmental
    contamination found at the Centredale Manor Restoration Project
    Superfund site, located in North Providence, Rhode Island. The
    EPA has discovered a variety of contaminants at the site,
    including but not limited to, dioxins, polychlorinated
    biphenyls, and pesticides. The EPA alleged that an affiliate of
    Black & Decker is liable for site

clean-up

costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) as a
    successor to the liability of Metro-Atlantic, Inc., a former
    operator at the site, and demanded reimbursement of the
    EPA’s costs related to this site. The EPA released a draft
    Feasibility Study Report in May 2010, which identified and
    evaluated possible remedial alternatives for the site.

The estimated remediation costs related to this Centredale site
    (including the EPA’s past costs as well as costs of
    additional investigation, remediation, and related costs such as
    EPA’s oversight costs, less escrowed funds contributed by
    primary potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who have reached
    settlement agreements with the EPA), which the Company considers
    to be probable and reasonably estimable, range from
    approximately $68.3 million to $212.8 million, with no
    amount within that range representing a more likely outcome
    until such time as the EPA completes its remedy selection
    process for the site. The Company’s reserve for this
    environmental remediation matter of $68.3 million reflects
    the fact that the EPA considers Metro-Atlantic, Inc. to be a
    primary source of contamination at the site. The Company has
    determined that it is likely to contest the EPA’s claims
    with respect to this site. Further, to the extent that the
    Company agrees to perform or finance additional remedial
    activities at this site, it intends to seek participation or
    contribution from additional PRPs



and insurance carriers. As the specific nature of the
    environmental remediation activities that may be mandated by the
    EPA at this site have not yet been determined, the ultimate
    remedial costs associated with the site may vary from the amount
    accrued by the Company at January 1, 2011.

The EPA and the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board
    have each initiated administrative proceedings against
    Black & Decker and certain of its current or former
    affiliates alleging that Black & Decker and numerous
    other defendants are responsible to investigate and remediate
    alleged groundwater contamination in and adjacent to a

160-acre

property located in Rialto, California. The cities of Colton and
    Rialto, as well as Goodrich Corporation, also initiated lawsuits
    against Black & Decker and certain of its former or
    current affiliates in the Federal District Court for California,
    Central District alleging similar claims that Black &
    Decker is liable under CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and
    Recovery Act, and state law for the discharge or release of
    hazardous substances into the environment and the contamination
    caused by those alleged releases. The City of Colton also has a
    companion case in California State court, which is currently
    stayed for all purposes. Certain defendants in that case have
    cross-claims against other defendants and have asserted claims
    against the State of California. The administrative proceedings
    and the lawsuits generally allege that West Coast Loading
    Corporation (“WCLC”), a defunct company that operated
    in Rialto between 1952 and 1957, and an as yet undefined number
    of other defendants are responsible for the release of
    perchlorate and solvents into the groundwater basin, and that
    Black & Decker and certain of its current or former
    affiliates are liable as a “successor” of WCLC. The
    Company believes that neither the facts nor the law support an
    allegation that Black & Decker is responsible for the
    contamination and is vigorously contesting these claims.

The Company recognizes liabilities for contingent exposures when
    analysis indicates it is both probable that an asset has been
    impaired or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    impairment or loss can reasonably be estimated. When a range of
    probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most
    likely amount.

In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is
    considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is
    accrued. In the normal course of business, the Company is
    involved in various lawsuits and claims. In addition, the
    Company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and
    state regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation.
    Also, the Company, along with many other companies, has been
    named as a PRP in a number of administrative proceedings for the
    remediation of various waste sites, including 36 active
    Superfund sites. Current laws potentially impose joint and
    several liabilities upon each PRP. In assessing its potential
    liability at these sites, the Company has considered the
    following: whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms
    of existing agreements, experience at similar sites, and the
    Company’s volumetric contribution at these sites.

The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental
    investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability
    recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts
    with respect to each individual site and includes such factors
    as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations,
    and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The
    liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for
    recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and
    remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded
    are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
    technical and legal information that becomes available. As of
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, the Company had
    reserves of $173.0 million and $29.7 million,
    respectively, for remediation activities associated with
    Company-owned properties, as well as for Superfund sites, for
    losses that are probable and estimable. Of the 2010 amount,
    $25.9 million is classified as current and
    $147.1 million as long-term which is expected to be paid
    over the estimated remediation period. The range of
    environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is
    $157 million to $349 million which is subject to
    change in the near term. The Company may be liable for
    environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns.
    Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with
    policy.

The environmental liability for certain sites that have cash
    payments beyond the current year that are fixed or reliably
    determinable have been discounted using a rate of 2.0% to 4.6%,
    depending on the expected timing of



disbursements. The discounted and undiscounted amount of the
    liability relative to these sites is $19.6 million and
    $32.5 million, respectively. The payments relative to these
    sites are expected to be $2.5 million in 2011,
    $3.2 million in 2012, $1.6 million in 2013,
    $1.6 million in 2014, $1.2 million in 2015 and
    $22.4 million thereafter.

The amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is
    based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically
    and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
    information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred
    in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the
    inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject
    to the imprecision in estimating future contingent liability
    costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to
    pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts
    recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or liquidity.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

On July 25, 2008, the Company sold its CST/berger laser
    leveling and measuring business to Robert Bosch Tool Corporation
    for $195.6 million in cash and cumulatively has recognized
    an $81.1 million after-tax gain as a result of the sale.
    The Company sold three other smaller businesses during 2008 for
    total cash proceeds of $7.9 million and a total cumulative
    after-tax loss of $1.5 million. The net loss from
    discontinued operations in 2009 primarily related to the
    wind-down of one small divestiture and purchase price
    adjustments for CST/berger and other small businesses divested
    in 2008. Discontinued operations in 2008 reflect the gain
    recognized on the sale of CST/berger and one small business, as
    well as the operating results of the businesses prior to
    divestiture. The divestures of these businesses were made
    pursuant to the Company’s growth strategy which entails a
    reduction of risk associated with certain large customer
    concentrations and better utilization of resources to increase
    shareowner value.

CST/berger, which was formerly in the Company’s CDIY
    segment, manufactures and distributes surveying accessories as
    well as building and construction instruments primarily in the
    Americas and Europe. Two of the small businesses that were sold
    were part of the Security segment, while the third minor
    business was part of the Industrial segment.

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 360
    “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets”, the results of
    operations of CST/berger and the three small businesses have
    been reported as discontinued operations. The operating results
    of the four divested businesses are summarized as follows:

U.

PARENT
    AND SUBSIDIARY DEBT GUARANTEES

The following information is presented in accordance with

Rule 3-10

of

Regulation S-X.

In connection with the Merger, on March 12, 2010, Stanley
    Black & Decker, Inc. (“Stanley”) and The
    Black & Decker Corporation (“Black &
    Decker”) entered into supplemental indentures providing for
    (i) senior unsubordinated guarantees by Black &
    Decker of Stanley’s existing notes (the
    “Black & Decker Guarantees”) and
    (ii) senior unsubordinated guarantees by Stanley of
    Black & Decker’s existing notes (the
    “Stanley Guarantees,” together with the
    Black & Decker Guarantees, the
    “Guarantees”). The Black & Decker Guarantees
    are in respect of the Company’s: 6.15% Notes due 2013;
    4.9% Notes due 2012; convertible notes due 2012; and
    5.0% Notes due 2010 (collectively the “Stanley
    Notes”). The Stanley Guarantees are in respect of
    Black & Decker’s: 5.75% Notes due 2016;
    8.95% Notes due 2014; 4.75% Notes due 2014;
    7.125% Notes due 2011; and 7.05% Notes due 2028 issued
    by Black & Decker Holdings, LLC, an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary of



Black & Decker (collectively, the
    “Black & Decker Notes”). The Stanley Notes
    and the Black & Decker Notes were issued under
    indentures attached as Exhibits to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Each of the Black & Decker Notes (other than the
    Black & Decker 7.05% Notes) and Black &
    Decker’s guarantee of the Black & Decker
    7.05% Notes rank equally with all of Black &
    Decker’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
    The Stanley Guarantees are unsecured obligations of the Company,
    ranking equal in right of payment with all the Company’s
    existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

On August 31, 2010, the Company issued $400.0 million
    of senior unsecured Term Bonds, maturing on September 1,
    2040. The 2040 Term Bonds are guaranteed on a senior unsecured
    basis by Black & Decker, a subsidiary of the Company.
    These 2040 Term Bonds as well as the remaining Stanley senior
    unsubordinated debt are not obligations of or guaranteed by any
    of the Company’s other subsidiaries. As a result, the 2040
    Term Bonds and the remaining Stanley senior unsubordinated debt
    are structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities
    of the Company’s subsidiaries other than Black &
    Decker. Additionally, on April 29, 2010 the
    Black & Decker Guarantee of the $320.0 million of
    Stanley’s convertible notes due May, 2012 was released. The
    Stanley Guarantees are unsecured obligations of Stanley ranking
    equal in right of payment with all of its existing and future
    unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

The following tables present the condensed consolidating balance
    sheets as of January 2, 2010 and January 1, 2011; the
    condensed consolidating statements of operations for the years
    ended January 1, 2011, January 2, 2010 and

    of cash flows for the years ended January 1, 2011,
    January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009. The condensed
    consolidated financial statements for the year ended
    January 1, 2011 include the results of Black &
    Decker from the Merger date. The 2009 comparative condensed
    consolidating financial statements reflect only the historical
    Stanley business.

For 2010, both basic and diluted earnings per share for the full
    year do not equal the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per
    share as reported for the first through fourth quarters. This is
    primarily due to a significant increase in basic and diluted
    weighted average shares outstanding from the issuance of
    78.5 million of stock to former Black & Decker
    shareowners as a result of the Merger.



During 2010, the Company recognized $538.4 million
    ($421.1 million after tax), or $2.80 per diluted share, in
    charges primarily related to the Merger which included
    amortization of inventory

step-up,

facility closure-related charges, certain executive compensation
    and severance costs, transaction and integration costs partially
    offset by pension curtailment gains. The impact of these merger
    and acquisition-related charges and effect on diluted earnings
    per share by quarter was as follows:

Merger and Acquisition-Related Charge

Diluted EPS Impact

•

Q1 2010 -

$212.8 million ($178.7 million after-tax)

$1.80 per diluted share

•

Q2 2010 -

$229.4 million ($160.3 million after-tax)

$0.97 per diluted share

•

Q3 2010 -

$57.5 million ($41.4 million after-tax)

$0.24 per diluted share

•

Q4 2010 -

$38.7 million ($40.7 million after-tax)

$0.24 per diluted share

In the second quarter of 2010, the Company recognized an income
    tax benefit attributable to the settlement of certain tax
    contingencies of $36 million, or $0.24 per diluted share
    ($0.21 per diluted share on a full-year basis).

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized a
    $43.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, pre-tax gain
    from the repurchase of $103.0 million junior subordinated
    debt securities. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company
    recognized $19.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in
    pre-tax transaction and integration planning charges primarily
    related to the pending Black & Decker merger.
