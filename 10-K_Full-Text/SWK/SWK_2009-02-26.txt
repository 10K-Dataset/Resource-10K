PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

1(a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

(i) General. The Stanley Works (“Stanley” or the
    “Company”) was founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley
    and incorporated in 1852. Stanley is a diversified worldwide
    supplier of tools and engineered solutions for professional,
    industrial and construction and do-it-yourself use, as well as
    engineered security solutions for industrial and commercial
    applications.
    Stanley

®

is a brand recognized around the world for quality and value.

Net sales from continuing operations have increased from
    $2.2 billion in 2002 to $4.4 billion in 2008
    reflecting execution of the Company’s profitable growth and
    diversification strategy. The growth in net sales from
    continuing operations predominantly relates to acquisitions,
    particularly in the Industrial and Security segments. The
    Company sold the CST/berger business in 2008, and the entry door
    and home décor businesses in 2004, along with several other
    small divestitures over the past few years. Results have been
    recast for these discontinued operations. Refer to Note F,
    Acquisitions, and Note U, Discontinued Operations, of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
    for a discussion of acquisitions and divestitures over the past
    three years. At January 3, 2009, Stanley employed
    approximately 18,225 people worldwide. The Company’s
    principal executive office is located at 1000 Stanley Drive, New
    Britain, Connecticut 06053 and its telephone number is

(860) 225-5111.

(ii) Restructuring Activities. Information regarding the
    Company’s restructuring activities is incorporated herein
    by reference to the material captioned “Restructuring
    Activities” in Item 7 and Note P, Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments, of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8.

1(b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

Financial information regarding the Company’s business
    segments is incorporated herein by reference to the material
    captioned “Business Segment Results” in Item 7
    and Note Q, Business Segments and Geographic Areas, of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

1(c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

The Company’s operations are classified into three business
    segments: Security, Industrial, and Construction &
    Do-It-Yourself. All segments have significant international
    operations in developed countries, but do not have large
    investments that would be subject to expropriation risk in
    developing countries. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates affect the U.S. dollar translation of international
    operations in each segment.

Security

The Security segment is a provider of access and security
    solutions primarily for retailers, educational, financial and
    healthcare institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and
    industrial customers. The Company provides an extensive suite of
    mechanical and electronic security products and systems, and a
    variety of security services. These include security integration
    systems, software, related installation, maintenance, monitoring
    services, automatic doors, door closers, exit devices, hardware
    (includes hinges, gate hardware, cabinet pulls, hooks, braces
    and shelf brackets) and locking mechanisms. Security products
    are sold primarily on a direct sales basis and in certain
    instances, through third party distributors.

Industrial

The Industrial segment manufactures and markets: professional
    industrial and automotive mechanics tools and storage systems;
    engineered healthcare storage systems; hydraulic tools and
    accessories; plumbing, heating and air conditioning tools;
    assembly tools and systems; and specialty tools. These products
    are sold to industrial customers and distributed primarily
    through third party distributors as well as through direct sales
    forces.

Professional mechanics tools and storage systems include
    wrenches, sockets, electronic diagnostic tools, tool boxes and
    high-density industrial storage and retrieval systems.
    Engineered healthcare storage systems are



customized cabinetry and storage solutions used to store and
    track clinical supplies. Hydraulic tools and accessories include
    hand-held hydraulic tools and accessories used by contractors,
    utilities, railroads and public works as well as mounted
    demolition hammers and compactors designed to work on skid steer
    loaders, mini-excavators, backhoes and large excavators.
    Plumbing, heating and air conditioning tools include pipe
    wrenches, pliers, press fitting tools, and tubing cutters.
    Assembly tools and systems include electric and pneumatic
    assembly tools; these are high performance precision tools,
    controllers and systems for tightening threaded fasteners used
    chiefly by vehicle manufacturers. Specialty tools are used for
    assembling, repairing and testing electronic equipment.

Construction & DIY

The Construction & Do-It-Yourself (“CDIY”)
    segment manufactures and markets hand tools, consumer mechanics
    tools, storage systems, pneumatic tools and fasteners. These
    products are sold to professional end users as well as
    consumers, and are distributed through retailers (including home
    centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber
    yards). Hand tools include measuring and leveling tools, planes,
    hammers, demolition tools, knives and blades, screwdrivers,
    saws, chisels and consumer tackers. Consumer mechanics tools
    include wrenches and sockets. Storage systems include plastic
    tool boxes and storage units. Pneumatic tools and fasteners
    include nail guns, staplers, nails and staples that are used for
    construction, remodeling, furniture making, pallet manufacturing
    and other applications involving the attachment of wooden
    materials.

Competition

The Company competes on the basis of its reputation for product
    quality, its well-known brands, its commitment to customer
    service, strong customer relationships, the breadth of its
    product lines and its emphasis on product innovation.

The Company encounters active competition in all of its
    businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the
    same or similar products and services or that produce different
    products appropriate for the same uses. The Company has a large
    number of competitors; however, aside from a small number of
    competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware
    businesses who produce a range of products somewhat comparable
    to the Company’s, the majority of its competitors compete
    only with respect to one or more individual products or product
    lines in that segment. Certain large customers offer private
    label brands (“house brands”) that compete across a
    wider spectrum of the Company’s CDIY segment product
    offerings. The Company is one of the largest manufacturers of
    hand tools in the world. The Company is a significant
    manufacturer of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners
    for the construction, furniture and pallet industries as well as
    a leading manufacturer of hydraulic tools used for heavy
    construction, railroad, utilities and public works. The Company
    also believes that it is among the largest direct providers of
    access security integration and alarm monitoring services in
    North America.

Customers

A substantial portion of the Company’s products are sold to
    home centers and mass merchants in the U.S. and Europe. A
    consolidation of retailers both in North America and abroad has
    occurred over time. While this consolidation and the domestic
    and international expansion of these large retailers provide the
    Company with opportunities for growth, the increasing size and
    importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of
    exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of certain of the
    larger home centers or mass merchants as customers could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company until either such
    customers were replaced or the Company made the necessary
    adjustments to compensate for the loss of business. Despite the
    trend toward customer consolidation, the Company has been able
    to maintain a diversified customer base and has decreased
    customer concentration risk over the past years, as sales from
    continuing operations in markets outside of the home center and
    mass merchant distribution channels have grown at a greater rate
    through a combination of acquisitions and other efforts to
    broaden the customer base, primarily in the Security and
    Industrial segments. In this regard, sales to the Company’s
    largest customer as a percentage of total sales have decreased
    from 22% in 2002 to 6% in 2008.

Within the Security segment, a large portion of sales are
    generated in the retail sector. The Security segment also has
    significant sales to commercial, governmental and educational
    customers.



Raw Materials

The Company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous
    and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to steel,
    aluminum, zinc, brass, copper and nickel, as well as resin.
    Additionally, the Company uses other commodity based materials
    for components and packaging including, but not limited to,
    plastics, wood, and other corrugated products. The raw materials
    required are procured globally and available from multiple
    sources at competitive prices. The Company does not anticipate
    difficulties in obtaining supplies for any raw materials or
    energy used in its production processes.

Backlog

Due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in most
    of the Company’s CDIY and Industrial segment businesses,
    backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of
    future performance. At February 2, 2009, the Company had
    approximately $348 million in unfilled orders. All of these
    orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current
    fiscal year. As of February 2, 2008, unfilled orders
    amounted to $368 million.

Patents and Trademarks

No business segment is dependent, to any significant degree, on
    patents, licenses, franchises or concessions and the loss of
    these patents, licenses, franchises or concessions would not
    have a material adverse effect on any of the business segments.
    The Company owns numerous patents, none of which individually is
    material to the Company’s operations as a whole. These
    patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. The
    Company holds licenses, franchises and concessions, none of
    which individually or in the aggregate are material to the
    Company’s operations as a whole. These licenses, franchises
    and concessions vary in duration, but generally run from one to
    40 years.

The Company has numerous trademarks that are used in its
    businesses worldwide. The
    STANLEY

®

and STANLEY in a notched rectangle design trademarks are
    material to all three business segments. These well-known
    trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are
    among the world’s most trusted brand names. The
    Company’s tagline, “Make Something
    Great

    is the centerpiece of the brand strategy for all segments. The

    being renewable indefinitely for like terms.

Environmental Regulations

The Company is subject to various environmental laws and
    regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries where it has
    operations. Future laws and regulations are expected to be
    increasingly stringent and will likely increase the
    Company’s expenditures related to environmental matters.

The Company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal
    and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental
    remediation. Additionally, the Company, along with many other
    companies, has been named as a potentially responsible party
    (“PRP”) in a number of administrative proceedings for
    the remediation of various waste sites, including fifteen active
    Superfund sites. Current laws potentially impose joint and
    several liabilities upon each PRP. In assessing its potential
    liability at these sites, the Company has considered the
    following: whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms
    of existing agreements, experience at similar sites, and the
    Company’s volumetric contribution at these sites.

The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental
    investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability
    recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts
    with respect to each individual site and includes such factors
    as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations,
    and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The
    liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for
    recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and
    remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded
    are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
    technical and legal



information that becomes available. As of January 3, 2009,
    the Company had reserves of $29 million for remediation
    activities associated with Company-owned properties, as well as
    for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable.

The amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is
    based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically
    and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
    information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred
    in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the
    inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures.
    Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental
    costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to
    pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the
    amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    liquidity.

Employees

At January 3, 2009, the Company had approximately
    18,225 employees, nearly 8,900 of whom were employed in the
    U.S. Approximately 750 U.S. employees are covered by
    collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 18 different
    local labor unions who are, in turn, affiliated with
    approximately 6 different international labor unions. The
    majority of the Company’s hourly-paid and weekly-paid
    employees outside the U.S. are not covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. The Company’s labor agreements in
    the U.S. expire in 2009, 2010 and 2011. There have been no
    significant interruptions or curtailments of the Company’s
    operations in recent years due to labor disputes. The Company
    believes that its relationship with its employees is good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The Company’s business, operations and financial
    condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You
    should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described
    below, together with all of the other information in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K,

including those risks set forth under the heading entitled
    “Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995”, and in other documents that
    the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission, before making any investment decision with respect
    to its securities. If any of the risks or uncertainties actually
    occur or develop, the Company’s business, financial
    condition, results of operations and future growth prospects
    could change. Under these circumstances, the trading prices of
    the Company’s securities could decline, and you could lose
    all or part of your investment in the Company’s
    securities.

If the
    current weakness continues in the housing and construction
    markets in the Americas, Europe or Asia, or general recessionary
    conditions worsen, it could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s business.

Approximately 37% of 2008 sales were in the Construction and
    Do-It-Yourself segment, and 29% in the Industrial segment. The
    Company experienced 10% sales unit volume declines in existing
    businesses, i.e. excluding acquisitions, in the fourth quarter
    of 2008, and 7% in the third quarter, primarily in these
    segments, as the recession spread worldwide. The Company’s
    business has been adversely affected by the decline in the
    U.S. and international economies, particularly with respect
    to housing and general construction markets. It is



possible this softness will be prolonged and to the extent it
    persists there is likely to be an unfavorable impact on sales,
    earnings and cash flows. It is possible the Security segment,
    which thus far has not experienced significant recession-related
    volume declines, may become more affected if the recessionary
    impacts permeate other market sectors, particularly construction
    within the retail sector. Further deterioration of these housing
    and construction markets, and general economic conditions, could
    reduce demand for Company products and therefore have a material
    adverse effect on sales, earnings and cash flows. In addition,
    due to current economic conditions, it is possible certain
    customers’ credit-worthiness may erode resulting in
    increased write-offs of customer receivables.

The
    Company’s growth and repositioning strategies include
    acquisitions. The Company’s recent acquisitions may not
    further its strategies and the Company may not be able to
    identify suitable future acquisition candidates.

In 2002, the Company embarked on a growth strategy to shift its
    business portfolio toward favored growth markets through
    acquisitions and divestitures, and thereby reduce the risk
    associated with large customer concentrations. The strategy has
    been advanced over the last several years with the sales of the
    Company’s CST/berger laser measuring, residential entry
    door and home décor businesses, and the acquisition of a
    number of companies, including General de Protection
    (“GdP”), Xmark Corporation (“Xmark”),
    Sonitrol Corporation (“Sonitrol”), HSM Electronic
    Protection Services, Inc. (“HSM”), Facom S.A.
    (“Facom”), National Manufacturing Co.
    (“National”), Besco Pneumatic Corporation
    (“Besco”), Blick plc (“Blick”), Frisco Bay
    Industries Ltd (“Frisco Bay”), ISR Solutions, Inc.
    (“ISR”), Security Group, Inc. (“Security
    Group”) and Best Lock Corporation and its affiliates
    (“Best Access”).

Although the Company has extensive experience with acquisitions,
    there can be no assurance that recently acquired companies will
    be successfully integrated or that anticipated synergies will be
    realized. If the Company successfully integrates the acquired
    companies and effectively implements its repositioning strategy,
    there can be no assurance that its resulting business segments
    will enjoy continued market acceptance or profitability.

In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
    able to successfully identify suitable future acquisition
    candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain the necessary
    financing, complete the transactions or successfully integrate
    the new companies as necessary to continue its growth and
    repositioning strategies.

The
    Company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its
    business and operations.

The Company has made a number of acquisitions in the past three
    years, including, but not limited to: GdP in October 2008,
    Sonitrol and Xmark in July 2008, InnerSpace in July 2007, HSM in
    January 2007, Besco in July 2006, and Facom in January 2006. The
    Company may make additional acquisitions in the future.
    Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:

•

the diversion of Company management’s attention and other
    resources,

•

the incurrence of unexpected liabilities, and

•

the loss of key personnel and clients or customers of acquired
    companies.

Any intangible assets that the Company acquires may have a
    negative effect on its earnings and return on capital employed.
    In addition, the success of the Company’s future
    acquisitions will depend in part on its ability to:

•

combine operations,

•

integrate departments, systems and procedures, and

•

obtain cost savings and other efficiencies from the acquisitions.

Failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions
    may adversely affect the Company’s existing businesses and
    harm its operational results. The Company is still in the
    process of integrating the businesses and operations of GdP,
    Xmark, Sonitrol, InnerSpace and other acquisitions with its
    existing businesses and



operations. The Company cannot ensure that such integrations
    will be successfully completed, or that all of the planned
    synergies will be realized.

The
    Company may incur significant additional indebtedness, or issue
    additional equity securities, in connection with future
    acquisitions which may restrict the manner in which it conducts
    business. The potential issuance of such securities may limit
    the Company’s ability to implement elements of its growth
    strategy and may have a dilutive effect on
    earnings.

As more fully described in Item 7 and Note I,
    Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company
    issued $450 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred
    Securities through its Trust subsidiary in 2005, the net
    proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the
    acquisitions of Facom and National. In March 2007, the Company
    completed concurrent offerings of Floating Rate Equity Units and
    5% Senior Notes due 2010, the net proceeds of which were
    used to finance a portion of the acquisition of HSM. In
    addition, the Company has a revolving credit agreement, expiring
    in February 2013, enabling borrowings up to $800 million.
    This agreement includes provisions that allow designated
    subsidiaries to borrow up to $250 million in Euros and
    Pounds Sterling, which may be available to, among other things,
    fund acquisitions.

The instruments and agreements governing certain of the
    Company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or
    restrictive covenants that include, among other things:

•

a limitation on creating liens on certain property of the
    Company and its subsidiaries;

•

maintenance of specified financial ratios. Failure to maintain
    such ratios could adversely affect further access to liquidity
    and require the Company to pay all interest coupons on certain
    debt securities through the issuance of common stock before
    making further dividend payments on its common shares
    outstanding;

•

a restriction on entering into certain sale-leaseback
    transactions; and

•

customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and
    is continuing, the Company might be required to repay all
    amounts outstanding under the respective instrument or agreement.

Future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may
    impose other restrictive conditions or covenants. Such covenants
    could restrict the Company in the manner in which it conducts
    business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth
    and repositioning strategies.

The
    Company’s results of operations could be negatively
    impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions
    that affect the cost of raw materials, freight, energy, labor
    and sourced finished goods.

The Company’s products are manufactured of both ferrous and
    non-ferrous metals, including but not limited to steel,
    aluminum, zinc, brass, nickel and copper, as well as resin.
    Additionally, the Company uses other commodity based materials
    for components and packaging including, but not limited to:
    plastics, wood, and other corrugated products. The
    Company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for
    freight, energy and labor. The Company also sources certain
    finished goods directly from vendors. As described in more
    detail in Item 7 hereto, the Company has been negatively
    impacted by inflation in recent years. If the Company is unable
    to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer
    pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives, its
    profitability may be adversely affected. Conversely, in the
    event there is deflation, the Company may experience pressure
    from its customers to reduce prices; there can be no assurance
    that the Company would be able to reduce its cost base (through
    negotiations with suppliers or other measures) to offset any
    such price concessions which could adversely impact results of
    operations and cash flows.

Tightening
    of capital and credit markets could adversely affect the Company
    by limiting the Company’s or its customers’ ability to
    borrow or otherwise obtain cash.

The Company’s growth plans are dependent on, among other
    things, the availability of funding to support corporate
    initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the
    ability to increase sales of existing product



lines. While the Company has not encountered financing
    difficulties to date, the capital and credit markets have been
    experiencing extreme volatility and disruption in late 2008 and
    early 2009 which could make it more difficult for the Company to
    borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new
    corporate initiatives and acquisitions. In addition, there could
    be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on the
    Company’s business, including insolvency of key suppliers
    resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain
    credit to finance purchases of the Company’s products

and/or

customer insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties
    and other financial institutions negatively impacting the
    Company’s treasury operations.

The
    Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates which could negatively impact
    profitability.

Exposure to foreign currency risk results because the Company,
    through its global operations, enters into transactions and
    makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. The
    Company’s predominant exposures are in European, Canadian,
    British, and Asian currencies, including the Chinese Renminbi
    (“RMB”). In preparing its financial statements, for
    foreign operations with functional currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at
    current exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated
    using weighted-average exchange rates. With respect to the
    effects on translated earnings, if the U.S. dollar
    strengthens relative to local currencies, the Company’s
    earnings could be negatively impacted. This occurred in the
    latter half of 2008 and is expected to persist in 2009. Although
    the Company utilizes risk management tools, including hedging,
    as it deems appropriate, to mitigate a portion of potential
    market fluctuations in foreign currencies, there can be no
    assurance that such measures will result in all market
    fluctuation exposure being eliminated. The Company does not make
    a practice of hedging its

non-U.S. dollar

earnings.

The Company sources many products from China and other Asian
    low-cost countries for resale in other regions. To the extent
    the RMB or other currencies appreciate with respect to the
    U.S. dollar, the Company may experience cost increases on
    such purchases. While the 7% appreciation of the RMB which
    occurred in both 2007 and 2008 has not generated material cost
    increases for products sourced from China, further significant
    appreciation of the RMB or other currencies in countries where
    the Company sources product could adversely impact
    profitability. The Company may not be successful at implementing
    customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the
    related cost increases and thus its profitability may be
    adversely impacted.

The
    Company’s business is subject to risks associated with
    sourcing and manufacturing overseas.

The Company imports large quantities of finished goods,
    components and raw materials. Substantially all of its import
    operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs
    and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements,
    bilateral actions or, in some cases unilateral action. In
    addition, the countries in which the Company’s products and
    materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time
    impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions
    on its imports (including restrictions on manufacturing
    operations) or adversely modify existing restrictions. Imports
    are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation
    which may increase the Company’s cost of goods sold.
    Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or the
    Company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs
    regulations or similar laws, could harm the Company’s
    business.

The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of
    international trade agreements and regulations such as the North
    American Free Trade Agreement, and the activities and
    regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these
    trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade
    liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by
    reducing or eliminating the duties

and/or

quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular
    country, trade agreements can also impose requirements that
    adversely affect the Company’s business, such as setting
    quotas on products that may be imported from a particular
    country into key markets such as the U.S. or the European
    Union, or make it easier for other companies to compete, by
    eliminating restrictions on products from countries, where the
    Company’s competitors source products.

The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and
    cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at
    ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and
    warehousing providers, such as port and



shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased
    homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other
    countries. These issues could delay importation of products or
    require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing
    providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives
    may not be available on short notice or could result in higher
    transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the
    Company’s business and financial condition.

Large
    customer concentrations and related customer inventory
    adjustments may negatively impact sales, results of operations
    and cash flows.

The Company has certain significant customers, particularly home
    centers and major retailers, although no one customer represents
    more than 10% of consolidated net sales. The loss or material
    reduction of business from, or the lack of success of sales
    initiatives for the Company’s products related to, any such
    significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the
    Company’s results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, unanticipated inventory adjustments by these
    customers can have a negative impact on sales. For example,
    severe inventory adjustments (pertaining to reducing the number
    of weeks supply on hand) taken by certain large North American
    home center customers in December 2005 negatively impacted sales
    by approximately $30 million versus normal levels.
    Significant impacts from customer inventory adjustments may
    re-occur in the future.

Customer
    consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business.

A substantial portion of the Company’s products in the CDIY
    and Industrial segments are sold through home centers and mass
    merchant distribution channels. A consolidation of retailers in
    both North America and abroad has occurred over time and the
    increasing size and importance of individual customers creates
    risk of exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of certain
    larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s business until either such
    customers were replaced or the Company made the necessary
    adjustments to compensate for the loss of business.

If the
    Company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill,
    indefinite-lived trade names, or other definite-lived intangible
    assets, its net income and net worth could be materially
    adversely affected.

As a result of acquisitions, the Company has $1.747 billion
    of goodwill, $300 million of indefinite-lived trade names,
    and $557 million of definite-lived intangible assets
    recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 3,
    2009. The Company is required to periodically, at least
    annually, determine if its goodwill or indefinite-lived trade
    names have become impaired, in which case it would write down
    the impaired portion of the intangible asset. The definite-lived
    intangible assets, including customer relationships, are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives; such assets are
    also evaluated for impairment when appropriate. Impairment of
    intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of
    the Company’s control, such as worsening economic
    conditions, technological change, intensified competition or
    other matters causing a decline in expected future cash flows.

Income
    tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently
    recorded by the Company. Future tax law changes may materially
    increase the Company’s prospective income tax
    expense.

The Company is subject to income taxation in the U.S. as
    well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in
    determining the Company’s worldwide income tax provision
    and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for
    which the final income tax determination is uncertain. The
    Company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many
    tax jurisdictions. Although management believes the recorded tax
    estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome from any audit
    (or related litigation) could be materially different from
    amounts reflected in the Company’s income tax provisions
    and accruals. Future settlements of income tax audits may have a
    material effect on earnings between the period of initial
    recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the
    point of ultimate tax audit settlement. Additionally, it is
    possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that
    could have a material impact on the Company’s worldwide
    income tax provision beginning with the period that such
    legislation becomes



effective. Also, while a reduction in statutory rates would
    result in a favorable impact on future net earnings, it would
    require an initial write down of any deferred tax assets in the
    related jurisdiction.

The
    Company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid,
    manage, defend, litigate and accrue for claims and litigation
    could negatively impact its results of operations or cash
    flows.

As described in further detail in Items 1 and 3 and
    Note T, Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company is exposed to
    and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out
    of the ordinary routine conduct of its business, including, from
    time to time, actual or threatened litigation relating to such
    items as commercial transactions, product liability, workers
    compensation, the Company’s distributors and franchisees,
    intellectual property claims, regulatory actions and
    environmental matters. There can be no assurance that the
    Company will be able to continue to successfully avoid, manage
    and defend such matters. In addition, given the inherent
    uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures, actual costs to
    be incurred in future periods may vary from the Company’s
    estimates for such contingent liabilities.

The
    Company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and
    violation of its trademark rights by imitators, or the failure
    of its licensees or vendors to comply with the Company’s
    product quality, manufacturing requirements, marketing
    standards, and other requirements could negatively impact
    revenues and brand reputation.

The Company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and
    value and are important to its success and competitive position.
    Unauthorized use of the Company’s trademark rights may not
    only erode sales of the Company’s products, but may also
    cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation,
    interfere with its ability to effectively represent the Company
    to its customers, contractors, suppliers,

and/or

licensees, and increase litigation costs. Similarly, failure by
    licensees or vendors to adhere to the Company’s standards
    of quality and other contractual requirements could result in
    loss of revenue, increased litigation,

and/or

damage to the Company’s reputation and business. There can
    be no assurance that the Company’s on-going effort to
    protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance
    with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all
    violations.

Successful
    sales and marketing efforts depend on the Company’s ability
    to recruit and retain qualified employees.

The success of the Company’s efforts to grow its business
    depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives,
    its sales force and other personnel, including the ability of
    its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales
    organization and achieve adequate customer coverage. The Company
    must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate
    management, sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain
    its current business and support its projected growth. A
    shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the
    Company’s ability to implement its growth strategy.

The
    Company faces active competition and if it does not compete
    effectively, its business may suffer.

The Company faces active competition and resulting pricing
    pressures. The Company’s products compete on the basis of,
    among other things, its reputation for product quality, its
    well-known brands, price, innovation and customer service
    capabilities. The Company competes with both larger and smaller
    companies that offer the same or similar products and services
    or that produce different products appropriate for the same
    uses. These companies are often located in countries such as
    China, Taiwan and India where labor and other production costs
    are substantially lower than in the U.S., Canada and Western
    Europe. Also, certain large customers offer house brands that
    compete with some of the Company’s product offerings as a
    lower-cost alternative. To remain profitable and defend market
    share, the Company must maintain a competitive cost structure,
    develop new products and services, respond to competitor
    innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely
    manner. The Company may not be able to compete effectively on
    all of these fronts and with all of its competitors, and the
    failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its
    sales and profit margins.



The Stanley Fulfillment System (“SFS”) is a continuous
    operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the
    Company’s business such as procurement, quality in
    manufacturing, maximizing customer fill rates, integrating
    acquisitions and other key business processes. In the event the
    Company is not successful in effectively applying the SFS
    disciplines to its key business processes its ability to compete
    and future earnings could be adversely affected.

In addition, the Company may have to reduce prices on its
    products and services, or make other concessions, to stay
    competitive and retain market share. The Company engages in
    restructuring actions, sometimes entailing shifts of production
    to low-cost countries, as part of its efforts to maintain a
    competitive cost structure. If the Company does not execute
    restructuring actions well, its ability to meet customer demand
    may decline, or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted;
    similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are
    delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the
    Company may lose market share and profits.

The
    performance of the Company may suffer from business disruptions
    associated with information technology, system implementations,
    or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other
    facilities.

The Company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and
    operate its businesses, and record and process transactions.
    Computer systems are important to production planning, customer
    service and order fulfillment among other business-critical
    processes. Consistent and efficient operation of the computer
    hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful
    sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many
    countries.

Despite efforts to prevent such situations, the Company’s
    systems may be affected by damage or interruption from, among
    other causes, power outages, computer viruses, or security
    breaches. Computer hardware and storage equipment that is
    integral to efficient operations, such as

e-mail,

telephone and other functionality, is concentrated in certain
    physical locations in the various continents in which the
    Company operates. Management believes it has effective disaster
    recovery plans and that it is unlikely there would be more than
    a short-lived disruption to its computer and communication
    systems due to these physical concentrations of equipment, or
    from potential occurrences of damage and interruption. However,
    it is reasonably possible that results could be adversely
    impacted if equipment outages were prolonged due to an unusually
    serious event. In addition, the Company is planning system
    conversions to SAP to provide a common platform across most of
    its businesses. The implementations from legacy systems to SAP
    will occur in carefully managed stages over a period of several
    years in the Americas, and ultimately thereafter in Europe and
    Asia. Management believes the planned system conversions are
    cost-beneficial and will further enhance productivity in its
    operations. There can be no assurances that expected expense
    synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to
    the expected timing. It is possible the costs to complete the
    system conversions may exceed current expectations, and that
    significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate
    expense recognition as opposed to capitalization. The risk of
    disruption to key operations is increased when complex system
    changes such as the SAP conversions are undertaken. If systems
    fail to function effectively, or become damaged, operational
    delays may ensue and the Company may be forced to make
    significant expenditures to remedy such issues. Any significant
    disruption in the Company’s computer operations could have
    a material adverse impact on its business and results of
    operations.

The Company’s operations are significantly dependent on
    infrastructure, notably certain distribution centers and
    security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in
    various geographic locations. If any of these were to experience
    a catastrophic loss, such as a fire or flood, it could disrupt
    operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result
    in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. The Company
    maintains business interruption insurance, but it may not fully
    protect the company against all adverse effects that could
    result from significant disruptions.



If the
    investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as
    expected, the Company may have to contribute additional amounts
    to these plans, which would otherwise be available to cover
    operating and other expenses. Certain U.S. employee benefit plan
    expense is affected by the market value of the Company’s
    common stock.

As described in further detail in Note M, Employee Benefit
    Plans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8, the Company sponsors pension and other
    post-retirement defined benefit plans, as well as an Employee
    Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) under which the primary
    U.S. defined contribution and 401(k) plans are funded. The
    Company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently
    invested in equity securities, bonds and other fixed income
    securities, and money market instruments. The Company’s
    funding policy is to contribute amounts determined annually on
    an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in
    accordance with applicable law which require, among other
    things, that the Company make cash contributions to under-funded
    pension plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately
    $20 million to its pension and other post-retirement
    defined benefit plans in 2009.

There can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit
    plan assets, or the investment returns on those plan assets,
    will be sufficient in the future. It is therefore possible that
    the Company may be required to make higher cash contributions to
    the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available
    for other business purposes, and that the Company will have to
    recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would
    decrease the net assets of the Company and result in higher
    expense in future years. During 2008 there was a
    $71 million loss on pension plan assets. The fair value of
    these assets at January 3, 2009 was $265 million.

Overall ESOP expense is affected by the market value of Stanley
    stock on the monthly dates when shares are released, among other
    factors. Net ESOP expense amounted to $11 million in 2008
    and $2 million in both 2007 and 2006. The increase in
    expense was mostly attributable to the average market value of
    shares released which decreased from $49.28 in 2006 to $43.65 in
    2008. However, the Company has discontinued the 401(k) and other
    defined contribution benefits in the ESOP for 2009 as part of
    its cost reduction initiatives and thus there will be a
    reduction in fiscal 2009 expense. In the event these defined
    contribution benefits are offered again, ESOP expense could
    increase in the future if the market value of the Company’s
    common stock declines.

The
    Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts
    receivable.

The Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not
    generally covered by collateral or credit insurance. While the
    Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit
    risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no
    assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk
    and avoid losses, which could have an adverse affect on the
    Company’s financial condition and operating results.

    future performance that constitute “forward-looking
    statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
    Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on
    current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about
    the industry and markets in which the Company operates and
    management’s beliefs and assumptions. Any statements
    contained herein (including without limitation statements to the
    effect that The Stanley Works or its management

    limitation, those set forth, or incorporated by reference, below
    under the heading “Cautionary Statements”. The Company
    does not intend to update publicly any forward-looking
    statements whether as a result of new information, future events
    or otherwise.

BUSINESS
    OVERVIEW

The Company is a diversified worldwide supplier of tools and
    engineered solutions for professional, industrial, construction,
    and do-it-yourself (“DIY”) use, as well as engineered
    and security solutions for industrial and commercial
    applications. Its operations are classified into three business
    segments: Security, Industrial and Construction & DIY
    (“CDIY”). The Security segment is a provider of access
    and security solutions primarily for retailers, educational,
    financial and healthcare institutions, as well as commercial,
    governmental and industrial customers. The Company provides an
    extensive suite of mechanical and electronic security products
    and systems, and a variety of security services. These include
    security integration systems, software, related installation,
    maintenance, monitoring services, automatic doors, door closers,
    exit devices, hardware and locking mechanisms. Security products
    are sold primarily on a direct sales basis and in certain
    instances, through third party distributors. The Industrial
    segment manufactures and markets: professional industrial and
    automotive mechanics tools and storage systems; engineered
    healthcare storage systems; assembly tools and systems;
    plumbing, heating and air conditioning tools; hydraulic tools
    and accessories; and specialty tools. These products are sold to
    industrial customers and distributed primarily through third
    party distributors as well as direct sales forces. The CDIY
    segment manufactures and markets hand tools, consumer mechanics
    tools storage systems, pneumatic tools and fastener products
    which are principally utilized in construction and
    do-it-yourself projects. These products are sold primarily to
    professional end users as well as consumers, and are distributed
    through retailers (including home centers, mass merchants,
    hardware stores, and retail lumber yards).

For several years, the Company has pursued a diversification
    strategy to enable profitable growth. The strategy involves
    industry, geographic and customer diversification, as
    exemplified by the expansion of security solution product
    offerings, the growing proportion of sales outside the U.S., and
    the deliberate reduction of the Company’s dependence on
    sales to U.S. home centers and mass merchants. Sales
    outside the U.S. represented 43% of the total in 2008, up
    from 29% in 2002. Sales to U.S. home centers and mass
    merchants have declined from a high point of approximately 40%
    in 2002 to approximately 13% in 2008. Execution of this strategy
    has entailed approximately $2.8 billion of acquisitions
    since the beginning of 2002, several divestitures, and increased
    brand investments. Additionally, the strategy reflects
    management’s vision to build a growth platform in security
    while expanding the valuable branded tools and storage platform.
    Over the past several years, the Company has generated strong
    free cash flow and received substantial proceeds from
    divestitures that enabled a transformation of the business
    portfolio.



Free cash flow, as defined in the following table, was
    $422 million in 2008, $457 million in 2007, and
    $359 million in 2006, considerably exceeding net earnings.
    Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of
    its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and
    provide a dividend to shareowners. In 2008, free cash flow also
    excludes the income taxes paid on the CST/berger divestiture due
    to the fact the taxes are non-recurring and the directly related
    gross cash proceeds are classified in investing cash flows. Free
    cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt
    service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on
    the Company’s common stock and business acquisitions, among
    other items.

The Company strives to reinvest its free cash flow in high

Significant areas of tactical emphasis related to execution of
    the Company’s diversification strategy, as well as events
    impacting the Company’s financial performance in 2008 and
    2007, are discussed below.

CONTINUED
    GROWTH OF SECURITY BUSINESS

During 2008, the Company further advanced its strategy of
    becoming a global market leader in the commercial security
    industry. Annual revenues of the Security segment have grown to
    $1.497 billion, or 34% of 2008 sales, up from
    $216 million, or 10% of 2001 sales. Key events pertaining
    to the growth of this segment in the past year include the
    following:

•

On July 18, 2008, the Company completed the acquisitions of
    Sonitrol Corporation (“Sonitrol”), for
    $282 million in cash, and Xmark Corporation
    (“Xmark”), for $47 million in cash. Sonitrol,
    with annual revenue totaling approximately $110 million,
    provides security monitoring services, access control and fire
    detection systems to commercial customers in North America.
    Sonitrol will complement the product offering of the
    pre-existing security integration and monitoring businesses,
    including HSM acquired in early 2007. Xmark, headquartered in
    Canada, markets and sells radio frequency identification
    (“RFID”)-based systems used to identify, locate and
    protect people and assets. Xmark, with annual revenues exceeding
    $30 million, will enhance the Company’s personal
    security business.

•

On October 1, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition
    of Générale de Protection (“GdP”) for
    $169 million in cash. GdP, headquartered in Vitrolles,
    France, is a leading provider of audio and video security
    monitoring services, primarily for small and mid-sized
    businesses located in France and Belgium. GdP, with 2007
    revenues totaling approximately $87 million represents
    Stanley’s first significant expansion of its electronic
    security platform in continental Europe.

Several other smaller acquisitions were completed for a total
    purchase price of $49 million including access technologies
    distributors, a mechanical lock business, and security
    monitoring businesses. The acquisitions complement the existing
    Security segment product offerings, increase its scale and
    strengthen the value proposition offered to customers as
    industry dynamics favor multi-solution providers that offer
    “one-stop shopping”. The Company continues to focus on
    integrating the acquired businesses as it expands the suite of
    security product and service offerings. The Sonitrol integration
    into HSM is well underway with the business sharing the same
    information technology platform while duplicative field offices
    are being eliminated. The reverse integration of the
    Company’s pre-existing systems integration business into
    HSM progressed further in 2008 contributing to a 80 basis
    point expansion in the segment profit rate to 17.9%.



Drive
    Further Profitable Growth in Branded Tools and
    Storage

While diversifying the business portfolio through expansion into
    Security is important, management recognizes that the branded
    construction & do-it-yourself products and industrial
    businesses are the foundations on which the Company was
    established and provide strong growth and cash flow generation
    prospects. Management is committed to growing these businesses
    through innovative product development, brand support, an
    increased weighting in emerging markets, and relentless focus on
    global cost competitiveness to foster vitality over the long
    term. Acquisition-related growth will also be pursued where
    appropriate. Two events in branded tools and storage are
    noteworthy:

•

In October 2008, the Company acquired Scan Modul, headquartered
    in Hillerod, Denmark, for $20 million cash. Scan Modul
    provides engineered healthcare storage equipment and services
    throughout Europe. The acquisition expands the Company’s
    healthcare storage technology offering provided by its existing
    Innerspace business acquired in July 2007.

•

In July 2008, the Company completed the sale of the CST/berger
    laser leveling and measuring business for $197 million in
    cash, net of transaction costs. The transaction generated a net
    book gain of $84 million, and $150 million in net
    after-tax cash proceeds. CST/berger had 2007 revenues of
    $80 million. As a result, CST/berger, along with three
    unrelated small businesses, is reported in discontinued
    operations and prior periods have been recast for comparability.

    was increased over the past several years, including television
    advertising campaigns associated with new product roll-outs,
    continued NASCAR racing sponsorships as well as print and
    outdoor advertising that generate approximately one billion
    brand impressions annually. These advertising and marketing
    campaigns yielded strong results as evidenced by a 40% increase
    in Stanley hand tool brand awareness since 2003.

Institutionalize
    the Stanley Fulfillment System

The Company continued to practice the operating disciplines
    encompassed by the Stanley Fulfillment System (“SFS”),
    which is a transformation of processes, systems, and structure
    that enables improvements in operations and creates customer
    value. The Company employs lean, value stream mapping, and other
    continuous improvement techniques to streamline operations and
    drive improvements throughout the supply chain. The foundation
    of SFS centers on lean, common platforms, sales and operations
    planning (“S&OP”), and complexity reduction.
    Benefits of SFS include reductions in lead times, costs and
    working capital, service level improvement, and focus on
    employee safety. The Company applies SFS to many aspects of its
    business including maximizing customer fill rates through
    S&OP, and acquisition integration. SFS entails lean
    manufacturing disciplines and maximizing common platforms to
    drive operational excellence and asset efficiency. The SFS
    program helped to mitigate the substantial impact of material
    and energy price inflation that was experienced in recent years.
    It was instrumental in the reduction of working capital during
    2008 and the 11% improvement in working capital turns to 5.9 in
    2008. In 2009 and beyond, the Company plans to further leverage
    SFS to achieve higher working capital turns, decreased cycle
    times, reduced complexity in operations and increased customer
    service levels. The Company is also migrating toward common
    systems platforms to reduce costs and provide scalability to
    support its long-term acquisition growth strategy.

Aside from the strategic commentary above, other matters having
    a significant impact on the Company’s results were
    inflation, currency exchange rate fluctuations and share
    repurchases. Additionally, the U.S. recessionary
    environment and slowing global demand in the second half of 2008
    necessitated significant cost reduction actions which will
    reduce the Company’s cost structure in 2009.



The Company has been negatively impacted by inflation, primarily
    commodity and freight, which has increased costs by an estimated
    $252 million over the past three years. During this period,
    more than two-thirds of the cost increase was recovered through
    customer pricing actions, and the remainder was mostly offset
    through various cost reduction initiatives. Inflationary trends
    have largely abated and are expected to be considerably less of
    a headwind in 2009. Inflation is estimated at $30 million
    for the first half of 2009. Due to the lagging nature of
    customer price increases, the Company expects a favorable
    carryover effect from previous customer pricing actions of
    approximately $30 - 50 million in 2009.

In recent years, the strengthening of foreign currencies had a
    favorable impact on the translation of foreign
    currency-denominated operating results into U.S. dollars.
    The favorable impact of foreign currency translation, including
    acquired companies, contributed an estimated $.09, $.18 and $.04
    of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may
    have a significant impact, either positive or negative, on
    future earnings. Although the overall translation impact in 2008
    was positive, the U.S. dollar strengthened in the second
    half of 2008 causing unfavorable effects that are expected to
    persist in 2009. Refer to the Market Risk section of this
    MD&A for further discussion.

During 2008 and 2007, the Company executed share repurchases of
    2.2 million and 3.6 million outstanding shares of its
    common stock, respectively, for $100 million in 2008 and
    $200 million in 2007. The share repurchase benefit was
    partially offset by the issuance of 3.1 million shares of
    common stock under various employee plans over the two year
    period, and also by higher interest expense associated with
    short-term borrowings made to finance the share repurchases.

In response to the continued decline in the U.S. housing
    market combined with deteriorating global demand in the second
    half of 2008, the Company took actions to reduce its cost
    structure and recognized $86 million in pre-tax
    restructuring and asset impairment charges, or $0.80 per diluted
    share. The pre-tax earnings benefit from the cost actions
    implemented both at mid-year 2008 and in conjunction with the
    restructuring announced on December 11, 2008 is expected to
    total approximately $195 million, or $1.75 per diluted
    share in 2009, with an additional $.24 per share benefit in
    2010. The Company likely will incur 2009 restructuring and
    related charges of approximately $40 - $50 million pre-tax
    for certain productivity initiatives and the continued
    rationalization of its manufacturing footprint, inclusive of
    approximately $10 million in carryover charges pertaining
    to the actions announced in December 2008.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Below is a summary of the Company’s operating results at
    the consolidated level, followed by an overview of business
    segment performance. The terms “organic” and
    “core” are utilized to describe results aside from the
    impact of acquisitions during their initial 12 months of
    ownership. This ensures appropriate comparability to operating
    results of prior periods.

Net Sales:

Net sales from continuing
    operations were $4.426 billion in 2008, as compared to
    $4.360 billion in 2007, a 2% increase. As a result of
    significant commodity inflation, the Company increased pricing
    on its products and services which provided a 3% sales benefit
    in 2008. Sales growth related to acquisitions, principally from
    Sonitrol, GdP and other small Security segment acquisitions,
    contributed nearly 4% in higher sales. Organic unit volume
    decreased 6%, while favorable foreign currency translation in
    all regions increased sales 1% versus the prior year. The
    organic unit volume decline reflects deteriorating economic
    conditions which spread from the U.S. to other regions in
    the second half of 2008. Sequentially, organic unit volume was
    down 4% for the first half of 2008, associated with the
    contraction in the U.S. residential construction market,
    and declined 7% and 10% in the third and fourth quarters,
    respectively. The CDIY segment unit volume was most affected by
    the economic downturn. In the Industrial segment, the
    U.S. based automotive-related businesses suffered sharp
    declines which were partially offset by strength in industrial
    storage. Aside from the hardware business, which had lower sales
    pertaining to the loss of a major customer in 2007, the Security
    segment had positive organic sales volume for the year
    reflecting solid demand in its diversified end markets.

Net sales from continuing operations were $4.360 billion in
    2007, as compared to $3.897 billion in 2006, a 12%
    increase. Acquisitions contributed 7%, or $263 million, of
    the sales increase. Organic volume and pricing



both increased 1%, while favorable foreign currency translation
    in all regions increased sales 3% versus the prior year. Strong
    performance in the Industrial segment, particularly by the
    hydraulic and mechanics tools businesses, was supplemented by
    more modest gains in the CDIY and Security segments. CDIY
    achieved robust growth internationally that was partially offset
    by weakness in the U.S. associated with housing market
    declines. In the Security segment, solid gains by the automatic
    door and mechanical lock businesses, as well as overall pricing
    actions, more than compensated for lower sales in the legacy
    electronic security integration business as it shed unprofitable
    equipment installations.

Gross Profit:

The Company reported gross
    profit from continuing operations of $1.671 billion, or 38%
    of net sales, in 2008, compared to $1.653 billion, or 38%
    of net sales, in 2007. The acquired businesses increased gross
    profit by $77 million and were modestly accretive to the
    gross margin rate. Core gross profit for 2008 was
    $1.594 billion, or 37% of net sales, down $59 million,
    or 60 basis points, from the prior year. The security
    segment achieved gross profit expansion associated with the
    higher monitoring services sales mix emanating from the reverse
    integration of the legacy security integration business into
    HSM. However this was more than offset by gross profit declines
    in the CDIY and Industrial segments reflecting sales volume
    pressures. Aggregate pricing and productivity actions in 2008
    largely offset $140 million of material, energy and wage
    cost inflation. As previously mentioned, the Company expects
    such inflation will increase first half 2009 costs by
    $30 million, which management plans to mitigate through the
    carryover effect from previous customer pricing actions, while
    it appears likely that inflationary effects may subside in the
    second half of 2009.

The Company reported gross profit from continuing operations of
    $1.653 billion, or 38% of net sales, in 2007, compared to
    $1.413 billion, or 36% of net sales, in 2006. The acquired
    businesses increased gross profit by $136 million. Core
    gross profit for 2007 was $1.517 billion, or 37% of net
    sales, up $104 million from the prior year. The core gross
    margin rate expanded on strong performances from certain
    Industrial segment businesses, primarily Facom and mechanics
    tools, as well as the absence of $22 million of inventory

step-up

amortization from the initial turnover of acquired inventory in
    2006. This was partially offset by a decline in the CDIY segment
    gross margin rate mainly from un-recovered cost inflation. In
    addition, the legacy security integration business had lower
    margins on certain equipment installations. Price and
    productivity actions in 2007 more than offset $67 million
    of material, energy and wage cost inflation.

SG&A Expense:

Selling, general and
    administrative expenses, inclusive of the provision for doubtful
    accounts, were $1.108 billion, or 25% of net sales, in 2008
    as compared with $1.038 billion, or 24% of net sales in
    2007. Acquired companies contributed $46 million of the
    increase. The remaining $24 million increase is largely
    attributable to foreign exchange impact, higher bad debt
    expense, and strategic investments including those to foster
    growth in emerging markets, partially offset by benefits from
    the cost reduction initiatives previously mentioned.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $1.038 billion, or 24% of net sales, in 2007 consistent
    with the 24% of sales represented by $932 million of
    expense in 2006. Acquired companies contributed $70 million
    of the increase, and the remaining $36 million increase is
    largely attributable to foreign currency translation.

Interest and

Other-net:

Net
    interest expense from continuing operations in 2008 was
    $73 million, compared to $80 million in 2007. The
    decrease is primarily due to lower applicable interest rates on
    commercial paper borrowings in 2008. The remainder of the
    decrease predominantly relates to repayment of $150 million
    of debt that matured in November 2007, partially offset by
    interest expense on $250 million of term debt issued in
    September 2008.

Net interest expense from continuing operations in 2007 was
    $80 million, compared to $65 million in 2006. The
    higher interest expense stems from borrowings necessary to fund
    the January 2007 acquisition of HSM. Refer to the Financial
    Condition section for additional discussion of the HSM
    acquisition financing.

Other-net

from continuing operations totaled $104 million of expense
    in 2008 compared to $87 million of expense in 2007. The
    increase mainly relates to higher intangible asset amortization
    expense due to recent acquisitions, as well as currency losses,
    partially offset by a $9 million gain on extinguishment of
    debt.



Other-net

from continuing operations totaled $87 million of expense
    in 2007 compared to $54 million of expense in 2006. The
    increase pertained primarily to higher intangible asset
    amortization expense due to recent acquisitions.

Income Taxes:

The Company’s effective
    income tax rate from continuing operations was 25% in both 2008
    and 2007, compared to 20% for 2006. The lower effective tax rate
    in 2006 primarily relates to benefits realized upon resolution
    of tax audits that did not re-occur. The effective income tax
    rate may vary in future periods based on the distribution of
    foreign earnings or changes in tax law in the jurisdictions
    where the Company operates, among other factors.

Discontinued Operations:

The $88 million
    of net earnings from discontinued operations in 2008 is
    attributable to the $84 million net gain from the sale of
    the CST/berger business along with three other small businesses
    divested in 2008, and also reflects the operating results of
    these businesses through the dates of disposition. The
    $11 million of net earnings from discontinued operations
    reported in both 2007 and 2006 reflects the operating results of
    CST/berger and the aforementioned other minor businesses.

Business
    Segment Results

The Company’s reportable segments are aggregations of
    businesses that have similar products, services and end markets,
    among other factors. The Company utilizes segment profit (which
    is defined as net sales minus cost of sales, and SG&A aside
    from corporate overhead expense), and segment profit as a
    percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each
    segment. Segment profit excludes the corporate overhead expense
    element of SG&A, interest income, interest expense,

other-net

(inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense),
    restructuring and asset impairments, and income tax expense.
    Corporate overhead is comprised of world headquarters facility
    expense, cost for the executive management team and the expense
    pertaining to certain centralized functions that benefit the
    entire Company but are not directly attributable to the
    businesses, such as legal and corporate finance functions. Refer
    to Note P, Restructuring and Asset Impairments, and
    Note G, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, of the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of
    restructuring charges and asset impairments, and intangibles
    amortization expense, respectively, attributable to each
    segment. As discussed previously, the Company’s operations
    are classified into three business segments: Security,
    Industrial, and Construction and Do-It-Yourself
    (“CDIY”).

Security segment sales increased 7% in 2008 primarily driven by
    acquisitions, notably Sonitrol and GdP, which contributed 9%.
    Customer price increases amounted to 3%, while foreign currency
    and organic volume declined 1% and 4%, respectively. The
    hardware business posted significant volume declines associated
    with the loss of a major customer in late 2007. Aside from
    hardware, the security segment had an increase in organic volume
    reflecting solid demand from its well-diversified customer base
    and associated recurring monthly revenues from service contracts
    for security monitoring and system maintenance. The access
    technologies and mechanical lock businesses delivered organic
    sales growth pertaining to modest volume increases and
    disciplined recovery of inflation through customer pricing
    actions. The reverse integration of the

U.S.-based

legacy security integration business as well as the integration
    of the July 2008 Sonitrol acquisition into HSM provided cost
    synergies and fostered a 80 basis point expansion of the
    segment profit rate. The segment profit improvement was also
    attributable to strong execution of productivity projects,
    partially offset by the impact of the previously discussed
    hardware business sales volume decline.

Security segment sales increased 24% in 2007. HSM and other
    acquisitions contributed 21%, while price grew 3%, currency 2%
    and organic volume declined 2%. Organic sales gains in automatic
    doors and mechanical locks were achieved on the strength of
    national and strategic account growth, while the hardware
    business demonstrated resilience in recovering from the loss of
    a key customer. Effective pricing actions to recover



inflation in raw material costs also contributed to sales growth
    in the segment. Shrinkage in the legacy U.S. security
    integration (“USSI”) business’ sales and segment
    profit was a necessary by-product of a business model change
    entailing a shift away from low profitability equipment
    installation to an emphasis on higher margin, recurring service
    revenues. The reverse integration of USSI into HSM, with its
    superior bidding and project management disciplines, progressed
    well. The broader security segment product line enabled the
    Company to compete more effectively in the architectural bidding
    process to attain gains in commercial construction markets. The
    2007 segment profit rate showed a strong expansion of
    210 basis points over 2006. This improvement was
    attributable to HSM, the non-recurring inventory

step-up

amortization for the National hardware acquisition recorded in
    2006, the benefits of a partial shift in hardware production to
    Asia, and overall pricing and productivity in excess of
    inflation. These positive factors were partially offset by the
    previously discussed decline in the legacy security integration
    businesses.

Industrial segment net sales increased 2% in 2008 versus 2007,
    attributable to the Innerspace and Scan Modul healthcare storage
    acquisitions. Foreign currency translation provided a 3%
    benefit, and favorable pricing 2%, which were offset by a 5%
    unit volume decline. The North American automotive repair
    business was adversely affected by distributor attrition and the
    deteriorating U.S. economy. European sales volumes, which
    had been positive in the first half of the year, declined in the
    second half as Facom and other businesses reflected the
    contraction of the European economy. These volume declines were
    partially offset by strong sales growth in

U.S.-based

engineered storage and to a lesser extent the hydraulic tools
    business. The sales growth in engineered storage was driven by
    government spending, particularly by army and navy bases, and
    also strength with commercial customers. The sales volume
    declines created substantial headwinds from unfavorable
    manufacturing plant absorption causing a decrease in the segment
    profit. Strong focus on customer pricing and productivity
    initiatives more than offset the effects of inflation.
    Additionally, the benefits of cost reduction actions partially
    mitigated the unfavorable impact of sales volume declines on
    segment profit.

Industrial segment net sales increased 10% in 2007 from 2006,
    comprised of a 4% volume increase, a 4% favorable foreign
    currency impact, 1% favorable pricing, and 1% from the
    Innerspace acquisition. Hydraulic tools and mechanics tools
    achieved robust sales increases, along with strong performance
    from the Facom and engineered storage businesses. The hydraulic
    tools sales increase was attributable to sustained high demand
    for recent shear product offerings, strong international sales,
    and favorable steel scrap markets. Industrial mechanics tools
    benefited from strong demand in the U.S. oil and gas
    industry. The higher Facom sales pertained to new product
    introductions and improved European economic conditions.
    Intensified marketing efforts, including an expanded sales
    force, contributed to the

U.S.-based

engineered storage business growth. Segment profit as a
    percentage of net sales improved 380 basis points.
    Excluding the effect of the one-time inventory

step-up

charge from the initial turn of Facom acquired inventory in
    2006, segment profit increased 270 basis points. Customer
    price increases effectively offset the impact of cost inflation,
    while productivity initiatives further contributed to the
    segment profit rate expansion. Additionally, Facom’s
    contribution to the higher segment profit rate reflected
    favorable currency translation and the benefits of acquisition
    integration actions.

CDIY net sales from continuing operations decreased 3% in 2008
    from 2007. Customer pricing increases, in response to rising
    commodity costs in the first three quarters of 2008, contributed
    3% to sales. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 2%,
    while organic volume declined 8%. Volume was negatively impacted
    by the contraction in residential construction in both the
    Americas and Europe, reductions in consumer spending, as well as
    a decline in industrial markets served by fastening systems,
    reflecting increasingly weak macro-economic conditions.
    Fastening systems continued its planned shift toward more
    profitable business which resulted in additional volume
    pressure. The sales volume decline also partially pertained to
    the shut-down of the unprofitable consumer metal storage
    business. Europe had essentially flat unit volume in the first
    half of 2008 but declined significantly in the second half.
    Despite declines in unit volume, CDIY retained focus on
    inventory levels and contributed a substantial part of the
    Company’s total working capital improvement. Progress was
    made on executing customer pricing actions but these benefits
    were significantly outpaced by cost inflation contributing to
    the profit rate erosion. The profit rate was also dramatically
    affected by lower sales volumes, and to a lesser extent
    strategic investments that will help generate future emerging
    markets growth. Productivity projects and cost reduction actions
    partially mitigated these unfavorable impacts.

CDIY net sales from continuing operations increased 5% in 2007
    from 2006. Foreign currency translation contributed 3% to the
    higher sales, pricing 1%, acquisitions 1%, and organic volume
    remained flat. The U.S. was adversely impacted by the
    housing market contraction as repair and remodel activity
    declined along with new construction. Sales were very strong in
    Canada, Europe, Australia, and Asia, in particular for the
    consumer tools and storage business. This positive international
    performance was bolstered by new product introductions including
    the
    FatMax

®

XL™ line, as well as favorable economic conditions outside
    the U.S. Fastening systems also experienced an overall
    decline in sales due to the U.S. housing down-turn,
    although its industrial channel and office product sales
    remained stable. During 2007, the Company took actions to
    improve the fastening systems cost structure including a Mexican
    plant closure, and the first wave of a pneumatic tool production
    shift to Asia, enabled by the 2006 Besco acquisition. As a
    result, fastening systems improved its margin rate slightly,
    despite the lower sales volume. The Company completed the
    migration of a second wave of fastening systems tool production
    to Asia during 2008, which further aided in reducing the cost
    structure. The segment profit rate decline of 60 basis
    points in 2007 was mainly attributable to un-recovered cost
    inflation, a product mix shift to lower margin tools along with
    a channel mix shift in the U.S., and unfavorable absorption on
    inventory reductions. These factors were partially offset by the
    favorable impact of foreign currency translation and the
    previously mentioned improvement in the fastening systems
    business.

2008 Actions:

During 2008, the Company
    initiated cost reduction initiatives in order to maintain its
    cost competitiveness. A large portion of these actions were
    initiated in the fourth quarter as the Company responded to
    deteriorating business conditions resulting from the
    recessionary U.S. economic weakness and slowing global
    demand, primarily in its CDIY and Industrial segments. Severance
    charges of $70.0 million have been recorded relating to the
    reduction of approximately 2,700 employees. In addition to
    severance, $13.6 million in charges were recognized
    pertaining to asset impairments for production assets and real
    estate, and $0.7 million for facility closure costs. The
    $1.2 million in other charges stemmed from the termination
    of service contracts. Of the amount recorded in 2008,
    $29.8 million has been utilized to date, for a remaining
    reserve as of January 3, 2009 of $55.3 million. The
    Company will utilize a majority of these reserves in 2009, and
    estimates approximately 30% will be expended in 2010 primarily
    pertaining to the timing of approvals from European governmental
    agencies.

Pre-2008 Actions:

During 2007, the Company
    initiated $11.8 million of cost reduction actions in
    various businesses. These actions were comprised of severance
    for 525 employees and the exit of a leased facility. The
    remaining reserves were fully utilized in 2008.

Acquisition Related:

During 2008,
    $6.4 million of reserves were established related to the
    Company’s current year acquisitions. Of this amount
    $5.3 million was for severance and related costs for
    approximately 200 employees and $1.1 million related
    to the closure of nine branch facilities. As of January 3,
    2009, $2.2 million has been utilized, leaving
    $4.2 million remaining. The Company also utilized
    $12.5 million of restructuring reserves during 2008
    established for various prior year acquisitions, principally
    Facom and HSM. As of January 3, 2009, $8.4 million in
    accruals remain for the prior year acquisitions. Of this balance
    approximately $7 million pertains to Facom for which the
    timing of payments depends upon the actions of certain European
    governmental agencies.

Of the $35.6 million of restructuring and asset impairment
    charges noted above for the CDIY segment, $13.6 million is
    for asset impairments related to the current and planned closure
    of several facilities. There were no asset impairments for the
    Security and Industrial segments in 2008. Fair value for
    impaired production assets was based on the present value of
    discounted cash flows. This included an estimate for future cash
    flows as production activities are phased out as well as auction
    values (prices for similar assets) for assets where use has been
    discontinued or future cash flows are minimal. Real estate
    values were based on estimates of anticipated sales values (less
    costs to sell) which contemplated sales of comparable properties
    and estimates from third party brokers.

FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

Liquidity, Sources and Uses of
    Capital:

The Company’s primary sources
    of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and
    available lines of credit under various credit facilities.

Operating and Investing Activities:

The
    Company has consistently generated strong operating cash flows
    over many years. In 2008, cash flow from operations totaled
    $517 million, down $27 million compared to 2007.
    Operating cash flow reflects a $46 million reduction for
    the taxes paid on the gain from the CST/berger divestiture, even
    though the directly related gross proceeds are reported as an
    investing cash flow. Working capital (receivables, inventories
    and accounts payable) generated $123 million of cash
    inflows, driven by accounts receivables reflecting the
    disciplines of SFS and a concerted effort to reduce past due
    accounts, and to a lesser extent inventory reductions. Cash
    outflows for restructuring activities totaled $33 million
    in 2008, a decrease of $25 million over 2007, primarily
    pertaining to cost reduction actions in the fourth quarter and
    the continuing payments under Facom Europe initiatives.

In 2007, cash flow from operations totaled $544 million, up
    $105 million compared to 2006. The favorable increase
    principally stems from an expansion of cash earnings and
    improved working capital performance. In this regard, the higher
    non-cash intangibles amortization expense from acquisitions
    reduced earnings but not cash flows. Working capital generated
    $23 million of higher cash inflows in 2007 compared with
    2006. This working capital improvement reflects leaner inventory
    positions achieved through process improvement efforts, while
    maintaining customer service levels, and was accomplished
    despite lower receivable sale proceeds in 2007 versus 2006.
    These favorable impacts were partially offset by cash outflows
    for restructuring activities which amounted to $58 million
    in 2007, an increase of $29 million over 2006, primarily
    pertaining to payments for the Facom Europe initiatives.

Capital expenditures were $141 million in 2008,
    $87 million in 2007, and $80 million in 2006. The
    higher capital expenditures in 2008 as compared with 2007 were
    primarily attributable to investment in the North American SAP
    information system implementation, and the purchase of a
    previously leased distribution facility. The increase in 2007
    capital expenditures versus 2006 pertained to investments for
    plant productivity improvements as well as ongoing information
    system spending for a major SAP implementation in the Americas.

Free cash flow, as defined in the following table, was
    $422 million in 2008, $457 million in 2007, and
    $359 million in 2006, considerably exceeding net earnings.
    Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of
    its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and
    provide a dividend to shareowners. In 2008, free cash flow also
    excludes the income taxes paid on the CST/berger divestiture due
    to the fact the taxes are non-recurring and the directly related
    gross cash proceeds are classified in investing cash flows. Free



cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt
    service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on
    the Company’s common stock and business acquisitions, among
    other items.

Based on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from
    operations as well as its strong balance sheet and credit
    position at January 3, 2009, the Company believes over the
    long term it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to
    its shareholders’ advantage through a combination of
    acquisitions, dividends, debt repayment, and potential future
    share repurchases. If lower sales volumes and earnings pressures
    pertaining to the weakened global economy persist, free cash
    flow may decrease in 2009, although continued efforts to improve
    working capital efficiency are expected to partially offset
    these headwinds. As a result of the recessionary environment,
    the Company anticipates that in 2009 it may have lower
    acquisition and share repurchase activity, and that free cash
    flow will likely be deployed for debt reduction to a greater
    extent than in the past few years.

In 2008, acquisition spending totaled $575 million, mainly
    for the GdP, Scan Modul, Sonitrol and Xmark businesses. 2007
    acquisition spending amounted to $643 million, primarily
    pertaining to the HSM, InnerSpace and Bedcheck businesses.
    Pursuant to its profitable growth strategy, the Company will
    continue to assess its current business portfolio for
    disposition opportunities and evaluate acquisition opportunities
    in favored markets while minimizing the risk associated with
    large customer concentrations.

Investing cash flows include $205 million in gross proceeds
    from sales of businesses, after transaction costs, primarily
    pertaining to the divestiture of the CST/berger laser measuring
    tool business in July 2008. As previously mentioned, the
    $46 million of income taxes paid on the gain are reported
    as an operating cash outflow and thus the total cash inflow from
    the 2008 divestitures amounts to $159 million.

During 2006, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback
    transaction of its corporate headquarters building. Under the
    terms of the transaction, the Company received $23 million
    in cash proceeds, reported in investing cash flows, and recorded
    a deferred gain of $11 million which will be amortized over
    the 15 year operating lease term. The cash proceeds were
    utilized to pay down short-term borrowings.

Financing Activities:

Payments on long-term
    debt amounted to $45 million in 2008, $228 million in
    2007, and $4 million in 2006. Net repayments of short-term
    borrowings totaled $74 million in 2008. The Company
    utilized the proceeds from the $250 million of long-term
    debt issued in September 2008 as well as the $159 million
    in net proceeds from divestitures to repay short-term
    borrowings, which was partially offset by the cash outflows for
    business acquisitions and other matters. Net proceeds from
    short-term borrowings totaled $192 million in 2007, and the
    cash inflows were used to fund acquisitions and repurchases of
    common stock. Repayments of short-term borrowings amounted to a
    cash outflow of $66 million in 2006 as commercial paper was
    paid down utilizing a portion of the strong operating cash flows.

On February 27, 2008, the Company amended its credit
    facility to provide for an increase and extension of its
    committed credit facility to $800 million from
    $550 million. In May 2008, the Company’s commercial
    paper program was also increased to $800 million. The
    credit facility is diversified amongst thirteen financial
    institutions. The credit facility is designated as a liquidity
    back-stop for the Company’s commercial paper program. The
    amended and restated facility expires in February 2013. As of
    January 3, 2009, there were no outstanding loans under this
    facility and the Company had $206 million of commercial
    paper outstanding. In addition, the Company has uncommitted
    short-term lines of credit with numerous foreign banks
    aggregating $246 million, of which $234 million was
    available at January 3, 2009. Short-term arrangements are
    reviewed annually for renewal. Aggregate credit lines amount to
    $1.046 billion.



The Company’s debt is currently rated by
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”),
    Moody’s Investor Service (“Moody’s”) and
    Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”). As of January 3, 2009
    the ratings for senior unsecured debt were A, A2, and A by
    S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch, respectively, each with a
    stable outlook on the Company. The short-term debt, or
    commercial paper, ratings are

A-1,

P-1,

and F1
    by S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch, respectively. On
    January 22, 2009, Moody’s placed the Company’s
    debt under review for possible downgrade. Failure to maintain
    the current ratings level could adversely affect the
    Company’s cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital
    markets, but would not have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s ability to access the previously discussed
    $800 million committed credit facility.

On September 29, 2008 the Company issued
    $250.0 million of unsecured Term Notes maturing
    October 1, 2013 (the “2013 Term Notes”) with
    fixed interest payable semi-annually, in arrears at a rate of
    6.15% per annum. The 2013 Term Notes rank equally with all of
    the Company’s existing and future unsecured and
    unsubordinated debt. The Company received net proceeds of
    $248.0 million which includes a discount of
    $0.5 million to achieve a 6.15% interest rate and
    $1.5 million of fees associated with the transaction. The
    proceeds were utilized to repay short-term borrowings.

The Company increased its cash dividend per common share to
    $1.26 in 2008. Dividends per common share increased 3.3% in
    2008, 3.4% in 2007, and 3.5% in 2006.

The Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common
    stock in 2008 for $103 million (an average cost of $46.21).
    In 2007 the Company repurchased 3.8 million shares of its
    common stock for $207 million (an average of $54.64 per
    share), and in 2006 it repurchased 4.0 million shares for
    $202 million (an average of $50.07 per share).

The Company initially funded the $546 million HSM
    acquisition with a combination of short-term borrowings and
    cash. A $500 million

364-day

revolving credit bridge facility was entered into on
    January 8, 2007, of which $130.0 million was utilized
    to acquire HSM; the remainder of the HSM purchase price was
    funded through commercial paper borrowings and cash.

On March 20, 2007, the Company completed two security
    offerings: “Equity Units”, which consisted of
    $330 million of five-year convertible notes and
    $330 million of three-year forward stock purchase
    contracts; and $200 million of unsecured three-year
    fixed-rate term notes. With respect to the $860 million in
    offerings, the Company will not receive the cash pertaining to
    the forward stock purchase contracts until May, 2010. The
    $488 million net cash proceeds of these offerings and the
    related equity instruments described below were used to pay down
    the short-term bridge facility and commercial paper borrowings.

In November 2008, the Company repurchased $10 million of
    the Equity Units for $5.3 million in cash. To properly
    account for the transaction, the Equity Unit elements were
    bifurcated as essentially the Company paid $10 million to
    extinguish the convertible notes and received $4.7 million
    from the seller to settle its obligation under the forward stock
    purchase contracts to purchase shares of the Company’s
    common stock at a minimum purchase price of approximately $54.45
    per share on May 17, 2010. At the repurchase date, the
    Company’s common stock had a closing market value of
    $25.38. The remaining liability for fees payable associated with
    the $10 million of settled forward stock purchase contracts
    was reversed, resulting in an increase to equity of
    $0.7 million. The related $10 million in convertible
    note hedges and stock warrants, which are described further
    below, were unwound with a nominal impact to equity. As a result
    of the various elements associated with the $10 million
    Equity Unit repurchase transaction there was an insignificant
    gain recorded in earnings and a net increase in equity of
    $5.4 million.

The convertible notes are pledged and held as collateral to
    guarantee the Equity Unit investors’ obligation to purchase
    shares in May 2010 under the stock purchase contracts. The
    convertible notes reflect a conversion price of approximately
    $64.80, or a 19% premium as of the date of issuance. At
    maturity, the Company must repay the convertible note principal
    in cash. Additionally, to the extent that the conversion option
    is “in the money” the Company, at its election, will
    deliver either cash or shares of common stock based on a
    conversion rate and the applicable market value of the
    Company’s common stock at that time. A maximum of
    approximately 5.9 million shares may be issued in May 2010
    under the stock purchase contracts, essentially at the higher of
    approximately $54.45 or market value at that time.



The Company simultaneously entered into related convertible note
    hedge and stock warrant transactions with financial
    institutions. Share dilution pertaining to the conversion option
    of the convertible notes will occur in interim periods if the
    share price exceeds approximately $64.80. At maturity in 2012,
    the convertible note hedge will offset the potentially dilutive
    impact of the conversion option aspect of the convertible notes.
    Because the convertible note hedge is anti-dilutive, it will not
    be included in any diluted shares outstanding computation prior
    to its maturity. However at maturity, the aggregate effect of
    the convertible notes and the convertible note hedge is that
    there will be no net increase in the Company’s common
    shares. The Company also issued 4.9 million of unregistered
    stock warrants that are exercisable during the period
    August 17, 2012 through September 28, 2012, with a
    strike price of $87.12 (subject to standard anti-dilution
    protection for increases in the dividend rate, stock splits
    etc.). In the event the stock warrants become “in the
    money” during their 5 year term, due to the market
    value of the Company’s common stock exceeding the strike
    price, there will be a related increase in diluted shares
    outstanding utilized in the determination of diluted earnings
    per share.

The combined terms of the convertible note hedge, stock
    warrants, and convertible notes in substance re-establish the
    conversion option aspect of the convertible notes at 60% above
    the $54.45 market value of the Company’s common stock at
    inception, such that in effect the Company will retain the
    benefits of share price appreciation, if any, up to a market
    value equal to the stock warrant strike price. Additionally the
    Company will retain benefits of share price appreciation, if
    any, through the maturity of the stock purchase contract element
    of the Equity Units that will entail issuance of
    $320 million of common shares at the higher of
    approximately $54.45 or market price in May 2010. Refer to
    Note I, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, for

MARKET
    RISK

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from
    adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments,
    currencies, commodities and other items traded in global
    markets. The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices,
    and commodity prices. Exposure to foreign currency risk results
    because the Company, through its global businesses, enters into
    transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple
    currencies. The Company’s predominant exposures are in
    European, Canadian, British, Australian, and Asian currencies,
    including the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) and the Taiwan
    Dollar. Certain cross-currency trade flows arising from sales
    and procurement activities as well as affiliate cross-border
    activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk
    protection through the use of various derivative financial
    instruments including: purchased basket options; purchased
    options; and currency forwards. The Company is thus able to
    capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of
    naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to
    reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection. At times,
    the Company also enters into forward exchange contracts and
    purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of
    non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables,
    predominately for affiliate transactions. Gains and losses from
    these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the
    underlying net exposures, assets and liabilities being hedged.
    Management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging
    activities, and in certain cases, may elect to allow certain
    currency exposures to remain unhedged. The Company has also
    entered into cross-currency swaps, to provide a partial hedge of
    the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the
    cash flows of operations to debt service requirements.
    Management estimates the foreign currency impact from these
    financial instruments at the end of 2008 would have been
    approximately a $9 million pre-tax loss based on a
    hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all derivative currency
    positions; this effect would occur from an appreciation of the
    foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company
    follows risk management policies in executing derivative
    financial instrument transactions, and does not use such
    instruments for speculative purposes. The Company does not hedge
    the translation of its

non-U.S. dollar

earnings in foreign subsidiaries.

As mentioned above, the Company routinely has cross-border trade
    and affiliate flows that cause a “transactional”
    impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. The
    Company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from
    the translation of foreign earnings into U.S. dollars, as
    previously discussed. It is more difficult to quantify the
    transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the
    translational effects. Aside from the use of derivative
    instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure,
    transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions
    the Company may take; for example, if an exposure occurs from a
    European entity sourcing product from a U.S. supplier it
    may be possible to change to a European supplier. As articulated
    in the Company’s fourth quarter earnings release filed on

Form 8-K

on January 28, 2009, if the U.S. dollar were to remain
    at levels prevailing in mid-January throughout fiscal 2009
    (including euro 1.34; Canadian $0.84; Pound Sterling 1.50;
    and Australian $0.69), then the combined unfavorable currency
    effect from both the translational and transactional aspects
    would be approximately $0.50



in lower diluted earnings per share as compared with 2008. In
    that event, the unfavorable impact would occur largely in the
    first half of 2009. Management estimates the combined
    translational and transactional impact of a 10% overall movement
    in exchange rates is approximately $0.30 per diluted share. With
    respect to transactional foreign currency market risk, the
    Company sources significant products from China and other Asian
    low cost countries for resale in other regions. To the extent
    the RMB or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the
    U.S. dollar, the Company may experience cost increases on such
    purchases. While the 7% appreciation of the RMB during 2008 has
    not as yet generated material cost increases for products
    sourced from China, further significant appreciation of the RMB
    or other currencies in countries where the Company sources
    product could adversely impact profitability. In the event
    significant RMB or other currency appreciation occurs, the
    Company would initiate customer pricing or other actions in an
    effort to mitigate the related cost increases, but it is
    possible such actions would not fully offset the potential
    unfavorable impact.

The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from
    its outstanding debt obligations, short-term investments, and
    derivative financial instruments employed in the management of
    its debt portfolio. The debt portfolio is managed to achieve
    capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of
    borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt
    as well as interest rate swaps, and cross-currency swaps. The
    Company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from
    its floating rate debt in the U.S. and Europe and is fairly
    represented by changes in LIBOR and EURIBOR rates. At
    January 3, 2009, the impact of a hypothetical 10% increase
    in the interest rates associated with the Company’s
    floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an
    immaterial effect on the Company’s financial position and
    results of operations.

The Company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses,
    particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc,
    steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods.
    Generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with
    derivative financial instruments, but instead are actively
    managed through customer product and service pricing actions,
    procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives and other
    productivity improvement projects. In 2008, the Company
    experienced approximately $140 million of commodity, energy
    and wage inflation, most of which was recovered through
    favorable pricing actions. Such inflation increased costs by
    approximately $67 million in 2007 and $45 million in
    2006, which management mitigated through various customer
    pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives. If commodity
    prices further increase, the Company’s exposure could
    increase from the expected levels for 2009 as previously
    discussed.

Fluctuations in the fair value of the Company’s common
    stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in
    the ESOP section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
    Additionally, the Company has $14 million in unfunded
    defined contribution plans for certain U.S. employees for
    which there is mark-to-market exposure.

The assets held by the Company’s defined benefit plans are
    exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities,
    primarily global stocks and fixed-income securities. The funding
    obligations for these plans would increase in the event of
    adverse changes in the plan asset values, although such funding
    would occur over a period of many years. This is exemplified by
    the fact that while there was a $71 million loss on pension
    plan assets in 2008 associated with volatile financial markets,
    the Company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit
    plans will modestly increase to approximately $20 million
    in 2009 as compared with $18 million in 2008. The Company
    employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this
    risk. Management has worked to minimize this exposure by
    freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate.

The Company has access to financial resources and borrowing
    capabilities around the world. There are no instruments within
    the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements
    due to a change in credit rating. The Company has the
    flexibility to elect deferral of interest payments on its ETPS
    obligation for up to 5 years. While there can be no
    guarantee of the future, the Company has an investment-grade
    credit rating and has enjoyed uninterrupted access to the
    commercial paper and bank markets throughout the credit crunch
    that has recently arisen. Further, the Company has not
    encountered liquidity difficulties historically when similar
    credit tightening has occurred due to macro-economic issues.
    Moreover, the Company’s existing credit facilities and
    sources of liquidity, including operating cash flows, are
    considered adequate to conduct business



as normal. Accordingly, based on present conditions and past
    history, management believes it is unlikely that operations will
    be materially affected by any potential further deterioration of
    the general credit markets that may occur. The Company believes
    that its strong financial position, operating cash flows,
    committed long-term credit facilities and borrowing capacity,
    and ready access to equity markets provide the financial
    flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend
    payments, to invest in the routine needs of its businesses, to
    make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives
    encompassed by its growth strategy.

OTHER
    MATTERS

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

As detailed in
    Note M, Employee Benefit Plans, of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has an Employee
    Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) under which the ongoing
    U.S. Cornerstone and 401(K) defined contribution plans are
    funded. Overall ESOP expense is affected by the market value of
    Stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released,
    among other factors. Net ESOP expense amounted to
    $11 million in 2008 and was $2 million in both 2007
    and 2006. The increase in expense was mostly attributable to the
    average market value of shares released which decreased from
    $49.28 in 2006 to $43.65 in 2008, as well as increased benefits
    pertaining to the headcount expansion from acquisitions. ESOP
    expense could increase in the future if the market value of the
    Company’s common stock declines. However, the Company has
    discontinued these benefits for 2009 as part of the cost actions
    taken and thus there will be a reduction in expense in fiscal
    2009.

CUSTOMER-RELATED RISKS

The Company has
    significant customers, particularly home centers and major
    retailers, though individually there are none that exceed 6% of
    consolidated sales. The loss or material reduction of business
    from any such significant customer could have a material adverse
    impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash
    flows, until either such customers were replaced or the Company
    made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of
    business.

There are no individually material credit exposures from
    particular customers. While the Company has strong credit
    policies and disciplined management of receivables, due to weak
    economic conditions or other factors it is reasonably possible
    that certain customers’ creditworthiness may decline and
    losses from receivable write-offs may increase.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Refer to Note A,
    Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new
    accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial
    position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Preparation of
    the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
    Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note A,
    Significant Accounting Policies. Management believes the most
    complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from
    the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with
    inherent uncertainty. The most significant areas involving
    management estimates are described below. Actual results in
    these areas could differ from management’s estimates.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  The Company’s
    estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to
    trade receivables is based on two methods. The amounts
    calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine
    the total amount reserved. First, a specific reserve is
    established for individual accounts where information indicates
    the customers may have an inability to meet financial
    obligations. In these cases, management uses its judgment, based
    on the surrounding facts and circumstances, to record a specific
    reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the
    receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These
    specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional
    information is received. Second, a reserve is determined for all
    customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivables
    aging categories. These percentages are based on historical
    collection and write-off experience.



If circumstances change, for example, the occurrence of higher
    than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a
    major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation
    to the Company, estimates of the recoverability of receivable
    amounts due could be reduced.

INVENTORIES — LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, SLOW MOVING AND
    OBSOLETE   Inventories in the U.S. are
    predominantly valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market, while

non-U.S. inventories

are valued at the lower of FIFO cost or market. The calculation
    of LIFO reserves, and therefore the net inventory valuation, is
    affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components. The
    Company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or
    market, and continually reviews the carrying value of
    discontinued product lines and stock-keeping-units
    (“SKUs”) to determine that these items are properly
    valued. The Company also continually evaluates the composition
    of its inventory and identifies obsolete

and/or

slow-moving inventories. Inventory items identified as obsolete

and/or

slow-moving are evaluated to determine if reserves are required.
    The Company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories
    at a price greater than cost. If it is determined that cost is
    less than market value, cost is used for inventory valuation. If
    market value is less than cost, the Company writes down the
    related inventory to that value. If a write down to the current
    market value is necessary, the market value cannot be greater
    than the net realizable value, or ceiling (defined as selling
    price less costs to sell and dispose), and cannot be lower than
    the net realizable value less a normal profit margin, also
    called the floor. If the Company is not able to achieve its
    expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its
    current value, reserves would have to be adjusted accordingly.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  The Company generally
    values Property, Plant and Equipment (“PP&E”) at
    historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Impairment losses
    are recorded when indicators of impairment, such as plant
    closures, are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
    to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying
    amount. The impairment loss is quantified by comparing the
    carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted
    cash flows, which consider various possible outcomes for the
    disposition of the assets (i.e. sale, leasing, etc.). Primarily
    as a result of plant rationalization, certain facilities and
    equipment are not currently used in operations. The Company
    recorded $14 million in asset impairment losses in 2008
    primarily as a result of key restructuring programs, and such
    losses may occur in the future.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  The Company completed
    acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 valued at $572 million and
    $646 respectively. The assets and liabilities of acquired
    businesses are recorded at fair value at the date of
    acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values
    assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses.
    The Company reported $1.747 billion of goodwill and
    $300 million of indefinite-lived trade names at
    January 3, 2009.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill and
    intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not
    amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. The
    identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized
    intangible asset impairment involves the estimation of fair
    value. Impairment testing of goodwill also requires the
    identification and valuation of reporting units. The estimates
    of fair value of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets
    and related reporting units are based on the information
    available at the date of assessment, including management
    assumptions about future cash flows, discount rates and royalty
    rates which are utilized to estimate the present value of future
    cash flows to be generated by the indefinite-lived assets.
    Future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or
    market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated
    synergies or cost savings are realized with acquired entities.
    While the Company has not recorded goodwill or other intangible
    asset impairment losses in many years, it is possible
    impairments may occur in the future in the event expected
    profitability, cash flows or trade name usage change from
    current estimates. This is particularly the case with respect to
    the convergent security solutions reporting unit which
    encompasses many recent acquisitions, and the fastening systems
    reporting unit which continues to rationalize its cost
    structure. Deteriorating global economic conditions increase the
    risk that impairment losses may occur in the future.

ENVIRONMENTAL  The Company incurs costs related to
    environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations
    governing current operations as well as the remediation of
    previously contaminated sites.



Future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly
    stringent and will likely increase the Company’s
    expenditures related to routine environmental matters.

The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental
    investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    loss can be reasonably estimated. The liability recorded is
    based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect
    to each individual site and includes such factors as existing
    technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior
    experience in remediation of contaminated sites. As assessments
    and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts
    recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
    additional technical and legal information that becomes
    available. As of January 3, 2009, the Company had reserves
    of $29 million for remediation activities associated with
    Company-owned properties as well as for Superfund sites, for
    losses that are probable and estimable. The range of
    environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is
    $19 million to $51 million which is subject to change
    in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental
    remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been
    recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy. While
    the Company believes the $29 million liability recorded for
    environmental matters is adequate, it is possible that future
    developments may require charges for environmental exposures in
    excess of this reserve.

INCOME TAXES  The future tax benefit arising from net
    deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards is
    $102 million at January 3, 2009. The Company believes
    earnings during the periods when the temporary differences
    become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related
    future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the
    expiration date of tax loss carry-forwards or the projected
    operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a
    valuation allowance is provided. The valuation allowance as of
    January 3, 2009 amounted to $25 million.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company
    estimates future taxable income, considering the feasibility of
    ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax
    loss carry-forwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred
    tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to
    statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the
    event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to
    realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the
    future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in
    the period in which that determination is made. By contrast, if
    the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize
    deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying
    amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance
    through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in
    which that determination is made. The Company periodically
    assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years
    still under audit based on the most current available
    information. When it is deemed probable that an adjustment will
    be asserted, the Company accrues its best estimate of the tax
    liability, inclusive of related interest charges. See
    Note R, Income Taxes, of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further discussion.

RISK INSURANCE  To some extent, the Company self
    insures for various business exposures. For domestic
    workers’ compensation, automobile and product liability,
    the Company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only
    for severe losses (“stop loss” insurance). The two
    risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates
    are workers’ compensation and product liability (liability
    for alleged injuries associated with the Company’s
    products). Actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk
    insurance consultant form the basis for workers’
    compensation and product liability loss reserves recorded. The
    actuary contemplates the Company’s specific loss history,
    actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical
    and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required.
    Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for
    individual claims and additional amounts expected for
    development of these claims, as well as for incurred but not yet
    reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known
    claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists
    (insurance companies) for workers’ compensation and by
    in-house legal counsel in consultation with outside attorneys
    for automobile and product liability. The cash outflows related
    to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over
    approximately 8 to 10 years, and the present value of
    expected future claim payments is reserved. The Company believes
    the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of
    January 3, 2009 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent
    in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate
    costs will differ from this estimate.



WARRANTY  The Company provides product and service
    warranties which vary across its businesses. The types of
    warranties offered generally range from one year to limited
    lifetime, while certain products carry no warranty. Further, the
    Company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its
    products in connection with product performance issues.
    Historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis
    for warranty obligations recognized. Adjustments are recorded to
    the warranty liability as new information becomes available. The
    Company believes the $66 million reserve for expected
    warranty claims as of January 3, 2009 is adequate, but due
    to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process,
    including forecasting future product reliability levels and
    costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products
    submitted for claims, the ultimate claim costs may differ from
    the recorded warranty liability.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENT

SYNTHETIC LEASES  The Company is a party to synthetic
    leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and
    certain U.S. personal property, predominately vehicles and
    equipment. The programs qualify as operating leases for
    accounting purposes, such that only the monthly rent expense is
    recorded in the Statement of Operations and the liability and
    value of the underlying assets are off-balance sheet. These
    lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and
    to retain flexibility. The cash outflows for lease payments
    approximate the $16 million of rent expense recognized in
    fiscal 2008. As of January 3, 2009, the estimated fair
    value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties
    were $68 million and $58 million, respectively.

CAUTIONARY
    STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM

ACT OF 1995

Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

including, but not limited to, the statements regarding the
    Company’s ability to: (i) achieve higher working
    capital turns, decrease cycle times, reduce complexity in
    operations and increase customer services levels;
    (ii) realize a favorable carryover effect from previous
    customer pricing actions of approximately $30-50 million in
    2009; (iii) generate a pre-tax benefit from cost actions
    implemented at mid-year 2008 and in conjunction with the
    restructuring announced on December 11, 2008 of
    approximately $195 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, in
    2009 with an additional $0.24 per share benefit in 2010;
    (iv) limit 2009 restructuring and related charges for
    certain productivity initiatives and the continued
    rationalization of the Company’s manufacturing footprint to
    approximately $40-50 million pre-tax; (v) limit
    inflation-related cost increases in the first half of 2009 to
    $30 million; (vi) continue to make acquisitions and
    dispositions; and (vii) limit funding obligations on the
    Company’s defined benefit plans to approximately
    $20 million in 2009 are forward-looking statements and are
    based on current expectations. These statements are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
    uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
    There are a number of risks, uncertainties and important factors
    that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
    indicated by such forward-looking statements. In addition to any
    such risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed elsewhere
    herein, the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could
    cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from
    those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements
    include, without limitation, those set forth under Item 1A
    Risk Factors hereto, those contained in the Company’s other
    filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and those
    set forth below.

The Company’s ability to deliver the results described
    above (the “Results”) is dependent upon: (i) the
    Company’s ability to implement the cost savings measures
    discussed in its December 11, 2008 press release within
    anticipated time frames and to limit associated costs;
    (ii) the Company’s ability to identify appropriate
    acquisition and disposition opportunities and to complete such
    acquisitions and dispositions; (iii) the Company’s
    ability to successfully integrate recent acquisitions (including
    GdP, Sonitrol, Xmark and Scan Modul), as well as future
    acquisitions, while limiting associated costs; (iv) the
    success of the Company’s efforts to manage freight costs,
    steel and other commodity costs; (v) the success of the
    Company’s efforts to sustain or increase prices in order
    to, among other things, offset or mitigate the impact of steel,
    freight, energy, non-ferrous commodity and other commodity costs
    and any inflation increases; (vi) the Company’s
    ability to identify and effectively execute productivity
    improvements and cost reductions while minimizing any



associated restructuring charges; (vii) the continued
    ability of the Company to access credit markets under
    satisfactory terms; and (viii) the Company’s ability
    to negotiate satisfactory payment terms under which the Company
    buys and sells goods, materials and products.

The Company’s ability to deliver the Results is also
    dependent upon: (i) the continued success of the
    Company’s marketing and sales efforts; (ii) the
    ability of the Company to maintain or improve production rates
    in the Company’s manufacturing facilities, respond to
    significant changes in product demand and fulfill demand for new
    and existing products; and (iii) the Company’s ability
    to continue improvements in working capital.

The Company’s ability to achieve the Results will also be
    affected by external factors. These external factors include:
    pricing pressure and other changes within competitive markets;
    the continued consolidation of customers particularly in
    consumer channels; inventory management pressures on the
    Company’s customers; the impact the tightened credit market
    may have on the Company or its customers or suppliers; the
    extent to which the Company has to write off accounts receivable
    or assets in connection with bankruptcy filings by customers or
    suppliers; increasing competition; changes in laws, regulations
    and policies that affect the Company, including, but not limited
    to, trade, monetary, tax and fiscal policies and laws; the
    timing and extent of any inflation or deflation in 2009;
    currency exchange fluctuations; the impact of dollar/foreign
    currency exchange and interest rates on the competitiveness of
    products and the Company’s debt program; the strength of
    the U.S. and European economies; the extent to which
    world-wide markets associated with homebuilding and remodeling
    continue to deteriorate; the impact of events that cause or may
    cause disruption in the Company’s manufacturing,
    distribution and sales networks such as war, terrorist
    activities, or political unrest, and recessionary or expansive
    trends in the economies of the world in which the Company
    operates, including, but not limited to, the extent and duration
    of the current recession in the US economy.

Unless required by applicable federal securities laws, the
    Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise
    any forward looking statements to reflect events or
    circumstances that may arise after the date hereof. Investors
    are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures made on
    related subjects in the Company’s reports filed with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission.

In addition to the foregoing, some of the agreements included as
    exhibits to this Annual Report on

Form 10-k

(whether incorporated by reference to earlier filings or
    otherwise) may contain representations and warranties, recitals
    or other statements that appear to be statements of fact. These
    agreements are included solely to provide investors with
    information regarding their terms and are not intended to
    provide any other factual or disclosure information about the
    Company or the other parties to the agreements. Representations
    and warranties, recitals, and other common disclosure provisions
    have been included in the agreements solely for the benefit of
    the other parties to the applicable agreements and often are
    used as a means of allocating risk among the parties.
    Accordingly, such statements (i) should not be treated as
    categorical statements of fact; (ii) may be qualified by
    disclosures that were made to the other parties in connection
    with the negotiation of the applicable agreements, which
    disclosures are not necessarily reflected in the agreement or
    included as exhibits hereto; (iii) may apply standards of
    materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed
    as material by or to investors in or lenders to the Company; and
    (iv) were made only as of the date of the applicable
    agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the
    agreement and are subject to more recent developments.

Accordingly, representations and warranties, recitals or other
    disclosures contained in agreements may not describe the actual
    state of affairs as of the date they were made or at any other
    time and should not be relied on by any person other than the
    parties thereto in accordance with their terms. Additional
    information about the Company may be found in this Annual Report

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

The management of Stanley is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Management has assessed the effectiveness of Stanley’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of January 3,
    2009. In making its assessment, management has utilized the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Management concluded
    that based on its assessment, Stanley’s internal control
    over financial reporting was effective as of January 3,
    2009. Management’s assessment of and conclusion on the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did
    not include the internal controls of Sonitrol Corporation
    (“Sonitrol”) which was acquired on July 18, 2008
    and Generale de Protection (“GdP”) which was acquired
    on October 1, 2008. Both Sonitrol and GdP are included in
    the 2008 consolidated financial statements of The Stanley Works
    and constituted total assets of approximately $564 million
    at January 3, 2009 and approximately $78 million of
    revenues for the year then ended. Ernst & Young LLP,
    the auditor of the financial statements included in this annual
    report, has issued an attestation report on the
    registrant’s internal control over financial reporting, a
    copy of which appears on page 44.

There has been no change in Stanley’s internal control over
    financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended
    January 3, 2009 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, Stanley’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive
    Officer and its Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the
    Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that
    evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
    and its Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material
    information relating to the Company (including its consolidated
    subsidiaries) required to be included in its periodic Securities
    and Exchange Commission filings. There have been no significant
    changes in the Company’s internal controls or in other
    factors that could significantly affect internal controls
    subsequent to the date of their evaluation.

ITEM 9B.

OTHER
    INFORMATION

On February 23, 2009, the Company entered into a Change in
    Control Severance Agreement (the “Agreement”) with
    Donald Allan Jr., and Mr. Allan ceased to be a participant
    in the Company’s Special Severance Plan. The Agreement is
    in the same form as agreements previously executed by other
    senior executives and provides for the following upon a
    qualifying termination: (i) a lump sum cash payment equal
    to 2.5 times annual base salary; (ii) a cash payment equal
    to 2.5 times average annual bonus over the three years prior to
    termination; (iii) continuation of certain benefits and
    perquisites for 2.5 years (or, if shorter, until similar
    benefits are provided by Mr. Allan’s new employer);
    (iv) a payment reflecting the actuarial value of an
    additional 2.5 years of service credit for retirement
    pension accrual purposes under any defined benefit or defined
    contribution plans maintained by Stanley; and
    (v) outplacement services (with the cost to the Company
    capped at $50,000). Mr. Allan also will be entitled to
    receive additional payments to the extent necessary to



compensate him for any excise taxes payable by him under the
    federal laws applicable to excess parachute payments.

The foregoing description does not purport to be a complete
    statement of the parties’ rights and obligations under the
    Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
    Agreement, which is being filed as an exhibit to this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of The Stanley Works is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
    is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external reporting purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
    detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness
    of The Stanley Works’ internal control over financial
    reporting as of January 3, 2009. In making its assessment,
    management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway
    Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework.
    Management concluded that based on its assessment, The Stanley
    Works’ internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of January 3, 2009. Management’s
    assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting did not include the internal

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Stanley Works

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    The Stanley Works and subsidiaries as of January 3, 2009
    and December 29, 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, changes in shareowners’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
    ended January 3, 2009. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of The Stanley Works and subsidiaries at
    January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, and the
    consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
    January 3, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note R to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    SFAS No. 109”, effective December 31, 2006.
    As discussed in Note M to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Post-retirement Plans – An amendment to FASB
    Statement Nos. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” effective
    December 30, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The
    Stanley Works’ internal control over financial reporting as
    of January 3, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 19, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Stanley Works

We have audited The Stanley Works’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of January 3, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Stanley
    Works’ management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s
    assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting did not include the internal
    controls of Sonitrol Corporation (“Sonitrol”) and
    Generale de Protection (“GdP”), companies acquired in
    2008, which are included in the 2008 consolidated financial
    statements of The Stanley Works and constituted total assets of
    approximately $564 million at January 3, 2009 and
    approximately $78 million of revenues for the fiscal year
    then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting of The Stanley Works also did not include an
    evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of
    Sonitrol and GdP.

In our opinion, The Stanley Works maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of January 3, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of The Stanley Works’ and
    subsidiaries as of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
    in shareowners’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
    three fiscal years in the period ended January 3, 2009 and
    our report dated February 19, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

A.
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Consolidated
    Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its
    majority-owned subsidiaries which require consolidation, after
    the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The
    Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to
    December 31. There were 53 weeks in the fiscal year
    2008 and 52 weeks in both of the fiscal years 2007 and 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
    revenues and expenses, as well as certain financial statement
    disclosures. While management believes that the estimates and
    assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements
    are appropriate, actual results could differ from these
    estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

For foreign
    operations with functional currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at
    current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using
    weighted-average exchange rates. Resulting translation
    adjustments are reported in a separate component of
    shareowners’ equity. Exchange gains and losses on
    transactions are included in earnings, and amounted to a net
    gain of $2.0 million for 2008 and net losses of
    $1.4 million and $3.8 million for 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

Highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less are considered
    cash equivalents.

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Trade
    receivables are stated at gross invoice amount less discounts,
    other allowances and provision for uncollectible accounts.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

The Company
    estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts using two methods.
    First, a specific reserve is established for individual accounts
    where information indicates the customers may have an inability
    to meet financial obligations. Second, a reserve is determined
    for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to
    aging categories. These percentages are based on historical
    collection and write-off experience. Actual write-offs are
    charged against the allowance when internal collection efforts
    have been unsuccessful.

INVENTORIES

U.S inventories are predominantly
    valued at the lower of

Last-In

First-Out (“LIFO”) cost or market because the Company
    believes it results in better matching of costs and revenues.
    Other inventories are valued at the lower of

First-In,

First-Out (“FIFO”) cost or market primarily because
    LIFO is not permitted for statutory reporting outside the
    U.S. See Note C, Inventory, for a quantification of
    the LIFO impact on inventory valuation.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

The Company
    generally values property, plant and equipment
    (“PP&E”), including capitalized software, on the
    basis of historical cost less accumulated depreciation and
    amortization. Costs related to maintenance and repairs which do
    not prolong the assets’ useful lives are expensed as
    incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided using
    straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets as follows:

Useful Life

(Years)

Land improvements

10 – 20

Buildings


Machinery and equipment

3 – 15

Computer software

3 – 5

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the
    estimated useful life or the term of the lease.

The Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment when
    indicators that the carrying values may not be recoverable are
    present. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, the
    Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and
    liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash
    flows are generated (“asset



group”) and estimates the undiscounted future cash flows
    that are directly associated with and expected to be generated
    from the use of and eventual disposition of the asset group. If
    the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows,
    an impairment loss must be determined and the asset group is
    written down to fair value. The impairment loss is quantified by
    comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the
    estimated fair value, which is determined using weighted-average
    discounted cash flows that consider various possible outcomes
    for the disposition of the asset group. During 2008, asset
    impairments totaled $13.6 million related to the
    Company’s restructuring actions which are described further
    in Note P Restructuring and Asset Impairments. PP&E
    impairment losses were minor in 2007 and 2006.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill
    represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the
    underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets
    acquired are recorded at estimated fair value. Goodwill and
    intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not
    amortized, but are tested for impairment annually during the
    third quarter, and at any time when events suggest an impairment
    may have occurred. To assess goodwill for impairment, the
    Company determines the fair value of its reporting units, which
    are primarily determined using management’s assumptions
    about future cash flows based on long-range strategic plans.
    This approach incorporates many assumptions including future
    growth rates, discount factors and tax rates. In the event the
    carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, an
    impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeded the
    implied fair value of the goodwill. Indefinite-lived intangible
    asset carrying amounts are tested for impairment by comparing to
    current fair market value, usually determined by the estimated
    cost to lease the asset from third parties. Intangible assets
    with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful
    lives generally using an accelerated method. Under this
    accelerated method, intangible assets are amortized reflecting
    the pattern over which the economic benefits of the intangible
    assets are consumed. Definite-lived intangible assets are also
    evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are present.
    If the carrying value exceeds the total undiscounted future cash
    flows, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed to determine
    the fair value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset
    were to exceed the fair value, it would be written down to fair
    value. No goodwill or other intangible asset impairments were
    recorded during 2008, 2007 or 2006.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative financial
    instruments are employed to manage risks, including foreign
    currency and interest rate exposures, and are not used for
    trading or speculative purposes. The Company recognizes all
    derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements,
    foreign currency options, and foreign exchange contracts, in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair
    value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in
    earnings or in Shareowners’ Equity as a component of other
    comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative
    financial instrument is undesignated or qualifies for hedge
    accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value,
    cash flow, or net investment hedge. Changes in fair values of
    derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in
    earnings along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged
    items that relate to the hedged risk. Gains and losses on
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they
    are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and
    subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of
    the hedged items when they occur. In the event it becomes
    probable the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge
    relates will not occur, the derivative would be terminated and
    the amount in other comprehensive income would generally be
    recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    used as hedges of the net investment in foreign operations are
    reported in other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair
    value of derivatives not designated as hedges under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities”, as amended, and any portion of a hedge that is
    considered ineffective, are reported in earnings in either Cost
    of sales for those derivatives relating to inventory purchases
    or

Other-net

for all other derivatives.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over
    the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

REVENUE
    RECOGNITION

General:

Revenue is
    recognized when the earnings process is complete, collectibility
    is reasonably assured, and the risks and rewards of ownership
    have transferred to the customer,



which generally occurs upon shipment of the finished product but
    sometimes is upon delivery to customer facilities. Provisions
    for customer volume rebates, product returns, discounts and
    allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same
    period the related sales are recorded.

Multiple Element Arrangements:

In 2008,
    approximately $975 million in revenues were generated by
    multiple element arrangements, primarily in the Security
    segment. These sales contracts typically consist of products
    sold and installed by the Company at the customer location.
    Revenue from equipment sales is generally recognized once
    installation is complete. Certain sales agreements also include
    maintenance and monitoring services pertaining to the installed
    equipment. Service revenue is recognized ratably over the
    contract term as services are rendered.

Customer billings for equipment not yet installed and for
    monitoring services not yet rendered are deferred. The
    associated deferred revenue is included in Accrued expenses in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the extent that customers
    have paid in advance of equipment or service delivery.

When a sales agreement involves multiple elements, deliverables
    are separately identified and consideration is allocated based
    on their relative fair values in accordance with Emerging Issues
    Task Force Issue

No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”
    Fair value is generally determined by reference to the prices
    charged in standalone transactions.

ADVERTISING COSTS

Television advertising is
    expensed the first time the advertisement airs, whereas other
    advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs are
    classified in SG&A and amounted to $39.3 million in
    2008, $42.1 million in 2007 and $42.1 million in 2006.
    Cooperative advertising expense reported as a deduction in net
    sales was $29.0 million in 2008, $28.0 million in 2007
    and $25.8 million in 2006.

ACQUISITION COSTS

Certain costs directly
    related to acquisitions including legal, audit and other fees,
    were recorded to goodwill for all acquisitions consummated
    during 2008 and earlier years as required under
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141”). Beginning in fiscal 2009 all such
    costs associated with new business acquisitions will be expensed
    as incurred. Refer to the section entitled New Accounting
    Standards also included within Note A for further details.

SALES TAXES

Sales and value added taxes
    collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities are excluded from net sales reported in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

The Company
    generally does not bill customers for freight. Shipping and
    handling costs associated with inbound freight are reported in
    cost of sales. Shipping costs associated with outbound freight
    are reported as a reduction of net sales and amounted to
    $129.7 million, $130.1 million and $124.9 million
    in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Distribution costs are
    classified as SG&A and amounted to $122.2 million,
    $128.7 million and $118.2 million in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Compensation cost
    relating to stock-based compensation grants is recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally
    four years. The expense for stock options and restricted stock
    units awarded to retirement eligible employees (those aged 55
    and over, and with 10 or more years of service) is recognized by
    the date they became retirement eligible.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is based on
    reported earnings before income taxes. Interest and penalties
    related to income taxes are classified as Income taxes in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred income taxes
    reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and
    liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such
    amounts recognized for tax purposes, and are measured by
    applying enacted tax rates in effect in years in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is
    recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is
    more likely than not to be realized.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share
    equals net earnings divided by weighted-average shares
    outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share include
    the impact of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock
    method when the effect is dilutive.



NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Implemented:

In September 2006, the FASB
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements.”(“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157
    establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework
    for measuring fair value, sets out a fair value hierarchy to be
    used to classify the source of information used in fair value
    measurements, and requires new disclosures of assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the
    hierarchy. SFAS 157 indicates that an exit value (selling
    price) should be utilized in fair value measurements rather than
    an entrance value, or cost basis, and that performance risks,
    such as credit risk, should be included in the measurements of
    fair value even when the risk of non-performance is remote.
    SFAS 157 also clarifies the principle that fair value
    measurements should be based on assumptions the marketplace
    would use when pricing an asset whenever practicable, rather
    than company-specific assumptions. In February 2008, the FASB
    issued Staff Positions (“FSPs”)

No. 157-1

and

No. 157-2,

which, respectively, remove leasing transactions from the scope
    of SFAS 157 and defer its effective date for one year
    relative to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
    except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value
    in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least
    annually). Accordingly, in fiscal 2008 the Company has applied
    SFAS 157 guidance to: (i) all applicable financial
    assets and liabilities; and (ii) nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    the Company’s financial statements on a recurring basis (at
    least annually). The adoption of SFAS 157 for these items
    did not have a material affect on the Company. The remaining
    assets and liabilities, to which the

FSP 157-2

deferral relates, will be measured at fair value as applicable
    beginning in fiscal 2009. This deferral relates to such items as
    impairment testing for goodwill, other intangible and long-lived
    assets and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
    initially measured at fair value in a business combination.
    Refer to Note N for disclosures required by this
    pronouncement.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No 159, “The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). This statement
    became effective for the Company at the beginning of 2008.
    SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many
    financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that
    are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The
    Company did not elect to utilize voluntary fair value
    measurements as permitted by the standard.

Not Yet Implemented:

In May 2008, the FASB issued
    Staff Position Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)” (“FSP APB

14-1”).

FSP APB

14-1

applies to convertible debt instruments that have a “net
    settlement feature” permitting settlement partially or
    fully in cash upon conversion. The guidance requires issuers of
    such convertible debt securities to separately account for the
    liability and equity components in a manner that reflects the
    issuer’s nonconvertible, unsecured debt borrowing rate. The
    FSP requires bifurcation of a component of the debt into equity,
    representative of the approximate fair value of the conversion
    feature at inception, and the amortization of the resulting debt
    discount to interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of
    Operations. The Company is in the process of assessing the
    impact of FSP APB

14-1,

but
    estimates that approximately $55 million of Long-term debt
    will be reclassified to equity as of the inception of the
    $330.0 million of convertible notes issued in March 2007.
    The estimated $55 million debt discount will be amortized
    to interest expense resulting in the recognition of
    approximately $8 — $12 million of additional
    non-cash interest expense annually. This non-cash interest
    expense is expected to total approximately $11 million in
    2009. The non-cash interest recognized will gradually increase
    over time using the effective interest method. FSP APB

14-1

will
    become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter
    of 2009 and is required to be applied retrospectively with early
    adoption prohibited.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) requires the
    acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full
    fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
    transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition), establishes
    the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for
    all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires the
    acquirer to disclose the information needed to evaluate and
    understand the nature and effect of the business combination.
    This statement applies to all transactions or other events in
    which the acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses,
    including those sometimes referred to as “true
    mergers” or “mergers of equals” and combinations
    achieved without the transfer of consideration, for example, by
    contract alone or



through the lapse of minority veto rights. For new acquisitions
    made following the adoption of SFAS 141(R), significant
    costs directly related to the acquisition including legal, audit
    and other fees, as well as most acquisition-related
    restructuring, will have to be expensed as incurred rather than
    recorded to goodwill as is generally permitted under
    SFAS 141. Additionally, contingent purchase price
    arrangements (also known as earn-outs) will be re-measured to
    estimated fair value with the impact reported in earnings,
    whereas under present rules the contingent purchase
    consideration is recorded to goodwill when determined.
    SFAS 141(R) applies prospectively for the Company to
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after January 4, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 requires reporting
    entities to present non-controlling (minority) interests as
    equity (as opposed to a liability or mezzanine equity) and
    provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an
    entity and non-controlling interests. SFAS 160 will apply
    prospectively and is effective as of the beginning of fiscal
    2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements
    which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented
    upon adoption. The Company has determined that the adoption of
    SFAS 160 will have a minimal impact on its results of
    operations and financial position.

In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)

No. 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” Under
    the FSP, unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights
    to receive nonforfeitable dividends (whether paid or unpaid) are
    participating securities, and should be included in the
    two-class method of computing EPS. The FSP is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim
    periods within those years, with retrospective application
    required. It is not expected to have a significant impact on the
    Company’s calculation of earnings per share.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133” which is effective for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Upon
    adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the statement will
    require enhanced disclosures related to the Company’s
    derivative instruments and will not impact the accounting for
    derivative instruments.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

The assets and liabilities
    of discontinued operations have been reclassified as held for
    sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and earnings from
    discontinued operations have been reclassified within the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. Certain other prior year
    amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
    presentation.

Trade receivables are dispersed among a large number of

Previously, the Company had agreements to sell, on a revolving
    basis, undivided interests in defined pools of accounts
    receivable to a Qualified Special Purpose Entity
    (“QSPE”). The entity was designed to facilitate the
    securitization of certain trade accounts receivable and was used
    as an additional source of liquidity. In June 2008, the Company
    acquired a third party’s interest in the QSPE. As a result,
    the entity became non-qualified. The net assets of this entity,
    which consisted of accounts receivable of $17.3 million,
    were consolidated in the Company’s balance sheet. Net cash
    flows between the Company and the entity totaled
    $43.2 million in 2008



and $18.0 million in 2007. Such activity primarily related
    to receivable sales, collections on receivables and servicing
    fees. In November 2008, this entity was dissolved. There were no
    gains or losses upon the acquisition of the third party interest
    or upon dissolution of the entity. The amounts deducted from
    receivables in the December 29, 2007 Consolidated Balance
    Sheet under this arrangement was $42.3 million.

F.

ACQUISITIONS

The Company completed 30 acquisitions during 2008, 2007 and
    2006. These businesses were acquired pursuant to the
    Company’s growth and portfolio repositioning strategy. The
    acquisitions were accounted for by



the purchase method in accordance with SFAS 141, and their
    results are included in the Company’s consolidated
    operating results from the respective acquisition dates. All of
    the acquisitions have resulted in the recognition of goodwill.
    Goodwill reflects the future earnings and cash flow potential of
    the acquired business in excess of the fair values that are
    assigned to all other identifiable assets and liabilities.
    Goodwill arises because the purchase price paid reflects
    numerous factors including the strategic fit and expected
    synergies these targets bring to existing operations, the
    competitive nature of the bidding process and the prevailing
    market value for comparable companies. SFAS 141 requires
    all identifiable assets and liabilities acquired to be reported
    at fair value and the excess is recorded as goodwill. The
    Company obtains information during due diligence and from other
    sources which forms the basis for the initial allocation of
    purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets and
    liabilities acquired. In the months following an acquisition,
    intangible asset valuation reports, asset appraisals and other
    data are obtained in order for management to finalize the fair
    values assigned to acquired assets and liabilities.

Integration of certain acquisitions requires reduction of
    redundant personnel, closure of facilities, and other
    restructuring actions related to the acquired businesses. In
    such cases, a restructuring accrual is recorded for actions
    identified in integration strategy plans initially developed by
    the Company as of the acquisition date, with a resulting
    increase to goodwill. As integration strategies are executed,
    the Company monitors the previously established restructuring
    accruals and makes adjustments to the extent actual expenditures
    differ from the estimated accruals. Adjustments recorded to
    previously established restructuring accruals until the time
    integration plans are fully executed, not to exceed one year
    from the date of original acquisition, are reflected in the
    final goodwill amount included in the purchase price allocation.
    Adjustments made subsequent to the finalization of integration
    strategies, or after one year from the date of original
    acquisition, are appropriately reflected in earnings if
    increases to the originally established accruals are required,
    while accruals that are not fully utilized are recorded as a
    reduction of goodwill.

2008 ACQUISITIONS

In July 2008, the Company
    completed the acquisition of Sonitrol Corporation
    (“Sonitrol”) for $282.1 million in cash. Sonitrol
    is a market leader in North American commercial security
    monitoring services, access control and fire detection systems,
    with annual revenues of approximately $110 million. The
    acquisition will complement the product offering of the
    pre-existing security integration businesses including HSM
    acquired in early 2007.

Also in July 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of
    Xmark Corporation (“Xmark”) for $47.1 million in
    cash. Xmark, headquartered in Canada, markets and sells radio
    frequency identification-based systems used to identify, locate
    and protect people and assets, with annual revenues of
    approximately $30 million. The acquisition expands the
    Company’s personal security business.

In October of 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of
    Generale de Protection (“GdP”) for $168.6 million
    in cash. GdP, headquartered in Vitrolles, France, is a leading
    provider of audio and video security monitoring services,
    primarily for small and mid-sized businesses located in France
    and Belgium. GdP’s annual revenues are approximately
    $87 million.

The Company also made eleven small acquisitions relating to its
    mechanical access systems, convergent security solutions,
    industrial healthcare storage and fastening businesses during
    2008. These eleven acquisitions were completed for a combined
    purchase price of $74.6 million.

The total purchase price of $572.4 million reflects
    transaction costs and is net of cash acquired, amounts allocated
    to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on
    their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Goodwill
    associated with the 2008 acquisitions that is deductible for
    income tax purposes amounts to $40.7 million. The purchase
    price allocations of these acquisitions are preliminary, mainly
    with respect to the finalization of intangible asset valuations,
    related deferred taxes, and certain other items.



The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of
    major assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the 2008
    acquisitions in the aggregate:

2007 ACQUISITIONS

The Company completed the
    acquisition of HSM Electronic Protection Services, Inc.
    (“HSM”) on January 16, 2007 for
    $546.1 million which was financed with debt and equity
    units as more fully described in Note  I, Long-Term
    Debt and Financing Arrangements. HSM is a market leader in the
    North American commercial security monitoring industry, with
    annual revenues of approximately $200 million. HSM has a
    stable customer base, an extensive North American field network
    and the second largest market share in the U.S. commercial
    monitoring market. The acquisition has served as a growth
    platform in the monitoring sector of the security industry.

The Company also made eight small acquisitions relating to its
    hydraulic, access technologies, industrial healthcare storage,
    mechanical access solutions and security integration businesses
    during 2007 for a combined purchase price of
    $100.1 million. Goodwill associated with the 2007
    acquisitions that is deductible for tax purposes amounted to
    $104.9 million.

The total purchase price of $646.2 million for the 2007
    acquisitions reflects transaction costs and is net of cash
    acquired. Amounts allocated to the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed are based on their estimated fair values at
    the acquisition dates. Adjustments to reflect the fair value of
    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are complete for all
    2007 acquisitions.

    $207.2 million, $5.7 million, $532.1 million and
    $258.8 million, respectively. Interest paid during 2008,
    2007, and 2006 amounted to $78.9 million,
    $85.0 million and $70.3 million, respectively.

On February 27, 2008, the Company amended its credit
    facility to provide for an increase and extension of its
    committed credit facility to $800.0 million from
    $550.0 million. In May 2008, the Company’s commercial
    paper program was also increased to $800.0 million. The
    credit facility is designated as a liquidity back-stop for the
    Company’s commercial paper program. The amended and
    restated facility expires in February 2013.

Included in Short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets as of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, is
    commercial paper of $205.7 million and $277.7 million,
    respectively. In addition, the Company has uncommitted
    short-term lines of credit with numerous banks aggregating
    $246.0 million, of which $233.7 million was available
    at January 3, 2009. Short-term arrangements are reviewed
    annually for renewal. The aggregate long-term and short-term
    lines amounted to $1.046 billion. The weighted average
    interest rates on short-term borrowings at January 3, 2009
    and December 29, 2007 were 2.4% and 4.6%, respectively.

On September 29, 2008 the Company issued
    $250.0 million of unsecured Term Notes maturing
    October 1, 2013 (the “2013 Term Notes”) with
    fixed interest payable semi-annually, in arrears at a rate of
    6.15% per annum. The 2013 Term Notes rank equally with all of
    the Company’s existing and future unsecured and
    unsubordinated debt. The Company received net proceeds of
    $248.0 million which includes a discount of
    $0.5 million to achieve a 6.15% interest rate and
    $1.5 million of fees associated with the transaction. The



Company used the net proceeds from the offering primarily to
    reduce borrowings under its existing commercial paper program.
    The $257.2 million of debt reported at January 3, 2009
    reflects the unamortized balance of the $7.9 million gain
    from a December 2008 swap termination. This fixed-to-floating
    interest rate swap was entered into upon issuance of the 2013
    Term Notes as detailed in Note J Financial Instruments. The
    2013 Term Notes include a Change of Control Triggering Event
    that would apply should a Change of Control event (as defined in
    the Indenture governing the 2013 Term Notes) occur. The Company
    would be required to make an offer to repurchase, in cash, all
    of the outstanding 2013 Term Notes for a purchase price at
    101.0% of the original principal amount, plus any accrued and
    unpaid interest outstanding up to the purchase date.

In May 2008, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating
    interest rate swap on its $200.0 million notes payable due
    in 2012. The $8.4 million increase in the carrying value of
    the debt at January 3, 2009 pertains to the gain recognized
    upon termination of this swap in December 2008 as more fully
    discussed in Note J Financial Instruments.

Junior
    Subordinated Debt Securities

In November 2005, the Company issued $450.1 million of
    junior subordinated debt securities to The Stanley Works Capital
    Trust I (the “Trust”), with a

40-year

term
    and a fixed initial coupon rate of 5.902% for the first five
    years. The Trust, which was not consolidated in accordance with
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
    No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
    an interpretation of ARB No. 51”
    (“FIN 46R”), obtained the funds it loaned to the
    Company through the capital market sale of $450.0 million
    of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities (“ETPS”)
    and through the sale of $0.1 million in Trust Common
    Securities to the Company. The obligations, tenor and terms of
    the ETPS mirrored those of the junior subordinated debt
    securities. The securities may be redeemed after five years
    without penalty. If not redeemed after 5 years, the coupon
    rate will reset quarterly to 1.4% plus the highest of

3-month

LIBOR, the

10-Year

US
    Treasury CMT or the

30-Year

US
    Treasury CMT, limited to a maximum rate of 13.25%. Net proceeds
    of the issuance were used to partially finance the acquisitions
    of Facom (January 1, 2006) and National
    (November 30, 2005).

In October 2008, the Company repurchased $34.3 million of
    the ETPS for $24.9 million in cash, and in December 2008
    the Trust was dissolved. Upon the dissolution of the Trust, the
    $0.1 million investment in the unconsolidated Trust was
    unwound with a corresponding reduction in debt. Additionally the
    Company caused the remaining $415.7 million of junior
    subordinated debt securities held by the Trust to be distributed
    to the holders of ETPS in exchange for the ETPS upon dissolution
    of the Trust. A pre-tax gain of $9.4 million was recognized
    in

Other-net

in the Statement of Operations pertaining to the partial
    extinguishment of this debt.

Financing
    of the January 2007 HSM Acquisition

During 2007, the Company initially funded the
    $546.1 million HSM acquisition with a combination of
    short-term borrowings and cash. A $500.0 million

364-day

revolving credit bridge facility was entered into on
    January 8, 2007, of which $130.0 million was utilized
    to acquire HSM; the remainder of the HSM purchase price was
    funded through commercial paper borrowings and cash.

On March 20, 2007, the Company completed two security
    offerings: “Equity Units”, which consisted of
    $330.0 million of convertible debt and $330.0 million
    of forward stock purchase contracts and $200.0 million of
    unsecured notes (the “2010 Term Notes”) . With respect
    to the $860.0 million in offerings, the Company will not
    receive the $330.0 million cash pertaining to the forward
    stock purchase contracts until May 2010. The $488.1 million
    net cash proceeds of these offerings and the related financial
    instruments described below were used to pay down the short-term
    bridge facility and commercial paper borrowings.

The 2010 Term Notes mature March 15, 2010 with fixed
    interest payable semi-annually, in arrears at a rate of 5.0% per
    annum and rank equally with other unsecured and unsubordinated
    debt of the Company. The $199.7 million of debt recorded at
    issuance reflects a $0.3 million discount to achieve a 5.0%
    fixed interest rate. The Company received proceeds from the 2010
    Term Notes of $198.9 million net of this discount and
    underwriters fees; this $1.1 million in discount and fees
    will be amortized to expense over the three year term.



The 2010 Term Notes include a change in control provision
    (“Change in Control Provision”) that would apply in
    the event there is a Change in Control (as defined in the
    Indenture governing the 2010 Term Notes) and the 2010 Term Notes
    are rated below investment grade. The Change in Control
    Provision provides investors with the right to require the
    Company to repurchase all or any part of their 2010 Term Notes
    in cash at a price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount plus
    accrued and unpaid interest.

Equity Units:

On March 20, 2007, the
    Company issued 330,000 Equity Units, each with a stated value of
    $1,000. The Equity Units are comprised of a senior convertible
    note (a “Convertible Note”) and a forward common stock
    purchase contract (an “Equity Purchase Contract”). The
    Company received $320.1 million in cash proceeds from the
    Equity Units offering, net of underwriting fees, and recorded
    $330.0 million in long-term debt for the Convertible Notes.
    These proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings and,
    along with $18.8 million in proceeds from the sale of stock
    warrants, to fund the $49.3 million cost of the convertible
    notes hedge as more fully described below.

In November 2008, the Company repurchased $10.0 million of
    the Equity Units for $5.3 million in cash (the “$10
    Million Repurchase”). To properly account for the
    transaction, the Equity Unit elements were bifurcated as
    essentially the Company paid $10.0 million to extinguish
    the Convertible Notes and received $4.7 million from the
    seller to settle its obligation under the Equity Purchase
    Contracts. As further detailed below, the Equity Purchase
    Contracts obligated the holder to purchase shares of the
    Company’s common stock at a minimum purchase price of
    approximately $54.45 per share on May 17, 2010. At the
    repurchase date, the Company’s common stock had a closing
    market value of $25.38. The remaining liability for Contract
    Adjustment Payment fees associated with the $10.0 million
    of settled Equity Purchase Contracts was reversed, resulting in
    an increase to equity of $0.7 million. The related
    $10.0 million in Convertible Note Hedges (the “Bond
    Hedge”) and Stock Warrants were unwound with a nominal
    impact to equity. As a result of the $10 Million Repurchase,
    there was an insignificant gain recorded in earnings and a net
    increase in equity of $5.4 million.

Equity
    Purchase Contracts:

The Equity Purchase Contracts obligate the holders to purchase
    on May 17, 2010, newly issued shares of the Company’s
    common stock for $320.0 million in cash. A maximum of
    5.9 million shares of common stock may be issued on the
    May 17, 2010 settlement date, subject to adjustment for
    standard anti-dilution provisions. Equity Purchase Contract
    holders may elect to settle their obligation early, in cash. The
    Convertible Notes, described further below, are pledged as
    collateral to guarantee the holders’ obligations to
    purchase common stock under the terms of the Equity Purchase
    Contracts. The agreed upon number of shares that each Equity
    Purchase Contract holder must purchase is called the
    “settlement amount”. The settlement amount is equal to
    the sum of the daily settlement amounts determined over a 20
    consecutive trading day period (the “observation
    period”) ending on and including the third trading day
    prior to the purchase contract settlement date. The settlement
    amount may be affected by standard anti-dilution protection
    provisions in the Equity Purchase Contracts or a cash merger. In
    effect, the Company will receive a minimum purchase price from
    investors of approximately $54.45 per share. The daily
    settlement amount for each trading day during the observation
    period is calculated as follows:

•

if the applicable market value of the Company’s common
    stock on that trading day is less than or equal to $54.45 (the
    “reference price”), the daily settlement amount for
    that trading day will be 0.9183 shares of the
    Company’s common stock; and

•

if the applicable market value of the Company’s common
    stock on that trading day is greater than the reference price,
    the daily settlement amount for that trading day will be a
    number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to $50
    divided by the applicable market value, rounded to the nearest
    ten thousandth share.

Holders of the Equity Purchase Contract are paid a quarterly
    contract adjustment payment (“Contract Adjustment
    Payment”) of 5.125% per annum, and the first payment
    thereof was made August 17, 2007. The $49.6 million
    present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments reduced
    Shareowners’ Equity at inception. As each quarterly
    Contract Adjustment Payment is made, the related liability will
    be relieved with the



difference between the cash payment and the present value of the
    Contract Adjustment Payment recorded as interest expense (at
    inception approximately $3.9 million accretion over the
    three year term). Due to the $10 Million Repurchase,
    $0.7 million in remaining liability for the related
    Contract Adjustment Payments was reversed. At January 3,
    2009 the liability reported for the Contract Adjustment Payments
    amounted to $22.9 million.

Convertible
    Notes:

The $320.0 million Convertible Notes currently outstanding
    have a five-year maturity and are due May 17, 2012. At
    maturity, the Company is obligated to repay the principal in
    cash, and may elect to settle the conversion option value, if
    any, as detailed further below, in either cash or shares of the
    Company’s common stock. The Convertible Notes bear interest
    at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR minus 3.5%, reset quarterly (but never less than zero),
    and initially set at 1.85%. Interest is payable quarterly
    commencing August 17, 2007. The Convertible Notes are
    unsecured general obligations and rank equally with all of the
    Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The
    Convertible Notes are pledged as collateral to guarantee the
    holders’ obligations to purchase common stock under the
    terms of the Equity Purchase Contract described above.

The Company is obligated to remarket the Convertible Notes
    commencing on May 10, 2010 to the extent that holders of
    the Convertible Note element of an Equity Unit or holders of
    separate Convertible Notes elect to participate in the
    remarketing. Holders of Equity Units who elect to have the
    Convertible Note element of these units not participate in the
    remarketing must create a Treasury Unit (replace the Convertible
    Notes with a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury security as
    substitute collateral to guarantee their performance under the
    Equity Purchase Contract), settle the Equity Purchase Contract
    early or settle it in cash prior to May 17, 2010. Upon a
    successful remarketing, the proceeds will be utilized to satisfy
    in full the Equity Unit holders’ obligations to purchase
    the Company’s common stock under the Equity Purchase
    Contract. In the event the remarketing of the Convertible Notes
    is not successful, the holders may elect to pay cash or to
    deliver the Convertible Notes to the Company as consideration to
    satisfy their obligation to purchase common shares under the
    Equity Purchase Contract.

The conversion premium for the Convertible Notes is 19.0%,
    equivalent to the initial conversion price of $64.80 based on
    the $54.45 value of the Company’s common stock at the date
    of issuance. Upon conversion on May 17, 2012 (or a cash
    merger event), the Company will deliver to each holder of the
    Convertible Notes $1,000 cash for the principal amount of the
    note. Additionally at conversion, to the extent, if any, that
    the conversion option is “in the money”, the Company
    will deliver, at its election, either cash or shares of the
    Company’s common stock based on an initial conversion rate
    of 15.4332 shares (equivalent to the initial conversion
    price set at $64.80) and the applicable market value of the
    Company’s common stock. The ultimate conversion rate may be
    increased above 15.4332 shares in accordance with standard
    anti-dilution provisions applicable to the Convertible Notes or
    in the event of a cash merger. An increase in the ultimate
    conversion rate will apply if the Company increases the per
    share common stock dividend rate during the five year term of
    the Convertible Notes; accordingly such changes to the
    conversion rate are within the Company’s control under its
    discretion regarding dividends it may declare. Also, the holders
    may elect to accelerate conversion, and “make whole”
    adjustments to the conversion rate may apply, in the event of a
    cash merger or “fundamental change”. Subject to the
    foregoing, if the market value of the Company’s common
    shares is below the conversion price at conversion, (initially
    set at a rate equating to $64.80 per share), the conversion
    option would be “out of the money” and the Company
    would have no obligation to deliver any consideration beyond the
    $1,000 principal payment required under each of the Convertible
    Notes. To the extent, if any, that the conversion option of the
    Convertible Notes becomes “in the money” in any
    interim period prior to conversion, there will be a related
    increase in diluted shares outstanding utilized in the
    determination of the Company’s diluted earnings per share
    in accordance with the treasury stock method prescribed by
    SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share.

Convertible Notes Hedge:

In order to offset
    the common shares that may be deliverable pertaining to the
    previously discussed conversion option feature of the
    Convertible Notes, the Company entered into Bond Hedges with
    certain major financial institutions. The Company paid the
    financial institutions a premium of



$49.3 million for the Bond Hedge which was recorded, net of
    $14.0 million of anticipated tax benefits, as a reduction
    of Shareowners’ Equity. The terms of the Bond Hedge mirror
    those of the conversion option feature of the Convertible Notes
    such that the financial institutions may be required to deliver
    shares of the Company’s common stock to the Company upon
    conversion at its exercise in May 2012. To the extent, if any,
    that the conversion option feature becomes “in the
    money” during the five year term of the Convertible Notes,
    diluted shares outstanding will increase accordingly. Because
    the Bond Hedge is anti-dilutive, it will not be included in any
    diluted shares outstanding computation prior to its maturity.
    However, at maturity of the Convertible Notes and the Bond Hedge
    in 2012, the aggregate effect of these instruments is that there
    will be no net increase in the Company’s common shares.

Stock Warrants:

Simultaneously, the Company
    issued 5,092,956 of unregistered common stock warrants
    (“Stock Warrants”) to financial institutions for
    $18.8 million. The cash proceeds received were recorded as
    an increase to Shareowners’ Equity. The Stock Warrants are
    exercisable during the period August 17, 2012 through
    September 28, 2012, and have a strike price of $87.12
    established at 160.0% of the market value of $54.45 on the
    issuance date. The Stock Warrants will be net share settled and
    are deemed to automatically be exercised at their expiration
    date if they are “in the money” and were not
    previously exercised. The strike price for the Stock Warrants
    may be adjusted for increases to the Company’s dividend
    rate per share, or special dividends, if any, that occur during
    their five year term (consistent with the standard anti-dilution
    provisions discussed earlier with respect to the conversion
    spread on the Convertible Notes). In the event the Stock
    Warrants become “in the money” during their five year
    term due to the market value of the Company’s common stock
    exceeding the $87.12 strike price, there will be a related
    increase in diluted shares outstanding utilized in the
    determination of the Company’s diluted earnings per share.
    In November 2008, 154,332 Stock Warrants were repurchased from
    the financial institutions at a cost of $.15 per warrant,
    pertaining to the previously mentioned $10 Million Repurchase.
    As a result, there were 4,938,624 Stock Warrants Outstanding as
    of January 3, 2009.

J.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s objectives in using debt and foreign currency
    related financial instruments are to obtain the lowest cost
    source of funds within a targeted range of variable to
    fixed-rate debt proportions, to better match financial
    obligations to sources of operating cash flows, and to minimize
    the foreign exchange risks arising from cross-border cash flows.
    To meet these risk management objectives, the Company enters
    into interest rate swap and currency swap agreements, purchased
    currency options and foreign exchange contracts. Derivative
    instruments are not employed for speculative purposes and are
    recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. If
    the Company elects to do so, hedge accounting is applied based
    on the criteria specified in SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities”(as amended) whereby management designates its
    derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or
    net investment hedges.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

Foreign exchange forward
    contracts are used to hedge multi-currency inter-company and
    trade cash flows expected to occur generally over a twelve to
    eighteen month period. The objective of these instruments is to
    minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on
    operating results. In addition, interest rate swaps are utilized
    to manage the mix of fixed versus floating rate liabilities.

Forward contracts:

The Company has entered
    into foreign exchange forward contracts denominated in
    Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Chinese renminbi, euros,
    Great Britain pounds, Polish zloty, Taiwanese dollars, and Thai
    bhat. At January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 the
    notional value of forward contracts designated as cash flow
    hedges and hedging inter-company transactions totaled $85.9
    million and $206.3 million, respectively. The aggregate
    fair value of these contracts is a loss of $1.5 million
    that is recorded in Other current assets and Accrued expenses in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The pre-tax amount recorded in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income related to forwards
    designated as cash flow hedges as of January 3, 2009 is
    $5.3 million. These amounts are expected to be reclassified
    into earnings over the next 12 months as the underlying
    hedged transactions affect earnings.



Interest rate swaps:

In December 2008, the
    Company terminated its lease and purchased one of its major
    distribution centers. In conjunction with the termination of the
    lease, the Company also terminated the interest rate swap used
    to exchange the floating rate rental liability to a fixed rental
    liability. The interest rate swap had a notional amount of
    $14.9 million and resulted in an immaterial gain upon
    termination.

In March 2007, concurrent with the issuance of the Equity Units,
    the Company executed interest rate swaps with an aggregate
    notional amount of $330.0 million to convert the floating
    rate coupon on the Convertible Notes (LIBOR less 350 basis
    points) to a fixed rate coupon (1.43%) for a period of three
    years. In November 2008, the Company repurchased
    $10 million of the Equity Units and reduced the amount of
    the interest rate swap by the corresponding amount to ensure
    that the notional amounts of the derivative and the underlying
    continued to match. At January 3, 2009, the aggregate fair
    value of the outstanding interest rate swaps is a net loss of
    $6.6 million as reflected in Accrued expenses and Other
    Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In 2005 the Company entered into a thirty year floating to fixed
    interest rate swap with a notional value of $150.0 million.
    The swap hedged the interest rate exposure associated with the
    forecasted refinancing of the $150.0 million 3.5% bonds
    maturing November 2007. During 2006 the swap was terminated,
    resulting in a $5.9 million gain before tax. The
    termination of this financial instrument was consistent with the
    Company’s risk management objective to obtain the lowest
    cost source of funds within a targeted range of variable to
    fixed rate interest rate proportions. The gain arising from the
    swap termination was reflected in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet during
    2006. In November 2007, upon the maturity of the bonds linked to
    the associated hedged interest rate exposure, $5.0 million
    of the gain was reclassified out of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income and recorded as a gain in

Other-net

in
    the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The remaining
    $0.9 million in Accumulated other comprehensive income will
    be amortized as a reduction to interest expense through May 2012.

Cross currency swaps:

The Company and its
    subsidiaries have entered into various inter-company
    transactions whereby the notional values are denominated in
    currencies other than the functional currencies of the party
    executing the trade (United States dollar and euro). In order to
    better match the cash flows of its inter-company obligations
    with cash flows from operations, the Company enters into cross
    currency swaps. At January 3, 2009, the aggregate fair
    value of the Company’s cross currency swaps that were
    designated as cash flow hedges was a net loss of
    $21.4 million as reflected in Accrued expenses and Other
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The swaps have an
    aggregate United States dollar notional value of
    $150.0 million and maturity dates in November 2010. In
    December 2008, the Company made a payment of $13.4 million
    related to the termination of a $90.5 million cross
    currency swap hedging an affiliate loan. The termination had a
    nominal impact to the Company’s earnings.

For derivative instruments that are so designated at inception
    and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the
    effective portions of the gain or loss on the derivative
    instrument in Accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate
    component of Shareowners’ Equity, and subsequently
    reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during
    which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. The
    ineffective portion of the gain or loss, if any, is immediately
    recognized in the same caption where the hedged items are
    recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations,
    generally

Other-net.

There is a $4.8 million after-tax gain reported for cash
    flow hedge effectiveness in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income as of January 3, 2009. Of this amount
    $4.6 million is expected to be reclassified to earnings as
    the hedged transactions occur or as amounts are amortized within
    the next 12 months, with the remainder through 2010. The
    ultimate amount recognized will vary based on fluctuations of
    the hedged currencies (Australian dollar, Canadian dollar,
    Chinese renminbi, euro, Great Britain pound, Polish zloty,
    Taiwanese dollar, Thai baht and United States dollar) through
    the maturity dates. During 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    $42.9 million, $(31.7) million, and
    $25.7 million, respectively, pertaining to cash flow
    hedges, was reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive
    income into earnings, during the periods in which the underlying
    hedged transactions affected earnings; due to the effectiveness
    of these instruments in matching the underlying on a net basis
    there was no significant earnings impact.



FAIR VALUE HEDGES

For derivative instruments
    that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the
    Company recognizes the gain or loss on the derivative instrument
    in earnings in the same caption where the offsetting gain or
    loss on the hedged item is recognized in the current period.

Interest rate swaps:

In an effort to continue
    to optimize the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt in the
    Company’s capital structure, in May 2008 and November 2008
    the Company entered into interest rate swaps with notional
    values which equaled the Company’s $200.0 million
    4.9% notes due November 2012 and $250.0 million
    6.15% notes due 2013. The interest rate swaps effectively
    converted the Company’s fixed rate debt to floating rate
    debt based on LIBOR, thereby hedging the fluctuation in the fair
    value resulting from changes in interest rates. The changes in
    fair value of the interest rate swaps were recognized in
    earnings as well as the offsetting changes in fair value of the
    underlying notes.

In December 2008, the Company terminated both interest rate
    swaps resulting in pre-tax gains of $16.5 million which was
    offset by the fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the
    underlying notes. At January 3, 2009 the carrying amounts
    of the $200.0 million and $250.0 million notes were
    increased by $8.4 million and $7.7 million
    respectively, related to this adjustment and will be amortized
    over the remaining term of the notes as a reduction of interest
    expense. The swaps were highly effective and, accordingly, no
    amount is recorded for ineffectiveness in the Consolidated
    Statement of Operations.

Cross currency swaps:

During 2008, the Company
    elected to discontinue the practice of designating cross
    currency swaps as fair value hedges. Previously designated cross
    currency swaps were dedesignated, and new cross currency swaps
    are undesignated. There was minimal impact to the Company’s
    financial statements resulting from this policy change.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGE

The Company utilizes net
    investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising
    from remeasuring its investment in the assets, liabilities,
    revenues, and expenses of its foreign subsidiaries. For
    derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net
    investment hedges, the Company records the effective portion of
    the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income. The Company had cross currency swaps
    and foreign exchange contracts denominated in Great Britain
    pounds and euro with an aggregate United States dollar notional
    value of $281.6 million to hedge its net investments of
    certain Great Britain pound and euro denominated assets. During
    the fourth quarter 2008, these contracts were terminated and
    resulted in gains of $19.1 million that will remain in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying
    assets are disposed of. In order to continue to offset the
    translation adjustment of its net investment in euro assets, in
    December 2008 the Company entered into a foreign exchange
    contract to hedge its net investment on euro assets. The
    contract has a notional value $223.4 million United States
    dollars, and a maturity of February 2010. At January 3,
    2009, the fair value of this contract was a loss of
    $20.7 million and is recorded in Other liabilities in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet and the pre-tax loss on the net
    investment hedge included in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income is $20.7 million.

UNDESIGNATED HEDGES

Cross currency swaps and
    foreign exchange forward contracts are used to reduce exchange
    risks arising from the change in fair value of certain foreign
    currency denominated assets and liabilities (i.e. affiliate
    loans, payables, receivables). The objective of these practices
    is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on
    operating results.

At January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, the notional
    amount of forward contracts hedging inter-company transactions
    totaled $203.9 million. These foreign exchange forward
    contracts are denominated in the Australian dollar, Canadian
    dollar, Czech koruna, Danish krone, euro, Japanese yen, Great
    Britain pound, Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar, Polish zloty,
    South African rand, Swiss franc, Swedish krona, Taiwanese dollar
    and Thai baht. The contracts mature in less than one year. The
    aggregate fair value of these forward contracts is a
    $3.8 million gain that is recorded in Other current assets
    and Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

At January 3, 2009, the notional amount of cross currency
    swaps hedging inter-company transactions totaled
    $259.3 million. These swaps are denominated in Canadian
    dollars, euros, Great Britain pounds and United States dollars.
    The contracts have maturities ranging January 2009 to September
    2010. The aggregate fair



value of these contracts is a net loss of $6.0 million that
    is recorded in Other currents assets, Accrued expenses, Other
    assets and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS

For forward contracts and
    cross currency swaps designated as cash flow, fair value or net
    investment hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by
    comparing the cumulative change in the hedge contract with the
    cumulative change in the hedged item, both of which are based on
    forward rates. The ineffective portion, if any, of the hedge is
    recognized in earnings immediately. Hedge ineffectiveness was
    negligible for 2008, 2007, and 2006.

For interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, the
    Company measures the hedge effectiveness by offsetting the
    change in the variable portion of the interest rate swap with
    the change in the expected interest flows due to fluctuations in
    the LIBOR based interest rate.

The counterparties to all of the above mentioned financial
    instruments are major international financial institutions. The
    Company is exposed to credit risk for net exchanges under these
    agreements, but not for the notional amounts. The risk of
    default is considered remote.

The carrying values and fair values of the Company’s
    financial instruments at January 3, 2009 and

PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

Each

    right. Each purchase right may be exercised to purchase one
    two-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $220.00, subject to
    adjustment. The rights, which do not have voting rights, expire
    on March 10, 2016, and may be redeemed by the Company at a
    price of $0.01 per right at any time prior to the tenth day
    following the public announcement that a person has acquired
    beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
    common stock. In the event that the Company is acquired in a
    merger or other business combination transaction, provision
    shall be made so that each holder of a right (other than a
    holder who is a 14.9%-or-more shareowner) shall have the right
    to receive, upon exercise thereof, that number of shares of
    common stock of the surviving Company having a market value
    equal to two times the exercise price of the right. Similarly,
    if anyone becomes the beneficial owner of more than 15% of the
    then outstanding shares of common stock (except pursuant to an
    offer for all outstanding shares of common stock which the
    independent directors have deemed to be fair and in the best
    interest of the Company), provision will be made so that each
    holder of a right (other than a holder who is a 14.9%-or-more
    shareowner) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon
    exercise thereof, common stock (or, in certain circumstances,
    cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a
    market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right.
    At January 3, 2009, there were 78,876,034 outstanding
    rights.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company has
    stock-based compensation plans for salaried employees and
    non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The plans
    provide for discretionary grants of stock options, restricted
    stock units, and other stock-based awards. The plans are
    generally administered by the Compensation and Organization
    Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of non-employee
    directors.

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted at
    the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of
    grant and have a 10 year term. Generally, stock option
    grants vest ratably over four years from the date of grant.

The following describes how certain assumptions affecting the
    estimated fair value of stock options are determined: the
    dividend yield is computed as the annualized dividend rate at
    the date of grant divided by the



strike price of the stock option; expected volatility is based
    on an average of the market implied volatility and historical
    volatility for the 5 year expected life; the risk-free
    interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with
    maturities equal to the expected life of the option; and an
    eight percent forfeiture rate is assumed. The Company uses
    historical data in order to estimate exercise, termination and
    holding period behavior for valuation purposes.

At January 3, 2009, the range of exercise prices on
    outstanding stock options was $19.34 to $63.04. Stock option
    expense was $4.9 million, $8.6 million and
    $8.2 million for the years ended January 3, 2009,
    December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively.

The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
    the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively: dividend yield of 3.8%, 2.4%
    and 2.4%; expected volatility of 45.0%, 28.0%, 26.0%; and
    risk-free interest rates of 1.8%, 3.6%, 4.2%. An expected life
    of 5 years was used in each period and a weighted average
    vesting period of 2.0 years in 2008, 2.5 years in 2007
    and 2.3 years in 2006. The weighted average fair value of
    stock options granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $9.25, $12.15,
    and $12.03, respectively.

At January 3, 2009, the Company had $15.3 million of
    unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense for stock options.
    This expense will be recognized over the remaining vesting
    periods which are 2.0 years on a weighted average basis.

During 2008, the Company received $12.6 million in cash
    from the exercise of stock options. The related tax benefit from
    the exercise of these options is $2.5 million. During 2008,
    2007 and 2006 the total intrinsic value of options exercised was
    $6.8 million, $37.9 million and $35.5 million,
    respectively. When options are exercised, the related shares are
    issued from treasury stock.

SFAS 123R requires the benefit arising from tax deductions
    in excess of recognized compensation cost to be classified as a
    financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as all
    such tax benefits were classified under earlier accounting
    guidance. To quantify the recognized compensation cost on which
    the excess tax benefit is computed, both actual compensation
    expense recorded following the adoption of SFAS 123R and
    pro-forma compensation cost reported in disclosures under the
    previous SFAS 123 standard in earlier periods is
    considered. An excess tax benefit is generated on the extent to
    which the actual gain, or spread, an optionee receives upon
    exercise of an option exceeds the fair value determined at the
    grant date; that excess spread over the fair value of the option
    times the applicable tax rate represents the excess tax benefit.
    In 2008 and 2007, the Company reported $3.8 million and
    $8.6 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits as a
    financing cash flow.

Compensation cost for new grants is recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period. The expense for
    retirement eligible employees (those aged 55 and over and with
    10 or more years of service) is recognized by the date they
    became retirement eligible, as such employees may retain their
    options for the 10 year contractual term in the event they
    retire prior to the end of the vesting period stipulated in the
    grant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

The Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) enables substantially all
    employees in the United States and Canada to subscribe at any
    time to purchase shares of common stock on a monthly basis at
    the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the shares on the
    grant date ($48.85 per share for fiscal year 2008 purchases) or
    85% of the fair market value of the shares on the last business
    day of each month. A maximum of 6,000,000 shares are
    authorized for subscription. During 2008, 2007 and
    2006 shares totaling 62,261, 68,848 and 64,590,
    respectively, were issued under the plan at average prices of
    $37.31, $44.33 and $39.26 per share, respectively and the
    intrinsic value of the ESPP purchases was $0.4 million,
    $0.8 million and $0.6 million respectively. For 2008,
    the Company received $2.3 million in cash from ESPP
    purchases, and there is no related tax benefit. The fair value
    of ESPP shares was estimated using the Black Scholes option
    pricing model. ESPP compensation cost is recognized ratably over
    the one year term based on actual employee stock purchases under
    the plan. The fair value of the employees’ purchase rights
    under the ESPP was estimated using the following assumptions for
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively: dividend yield of 3.7%, 2.2%
    and 2.4%; expected volatility of 28.0%, 22.0% and 23.0%;
    risk-free interest rates of 0.3%, 4.4% and 4.3%; and expected
    lives of one year. The weighted average fair value of those
    purchase rights granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6.59, $10.95
    and $9.70, respectively.

Restricted Share Units:

Compensation cost for
    restricted share units, including restricted shares granted to
    French employees in lieu of RSU’s, (collectively
    “RSU’s”) granted to employees is recognized
    ratably over the vesting term, which varies but is generally
    4 years. RSU grants totaled 241,036 shares,
    228,125 shares and 169,675 shares in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value
    of RSU’s granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $35.28, $49.13
    and $49.28 per share, respectively. Total compensation expense
    recognized for RSU’s amounted to $6.3 million,
    $7.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively; and the
    related tax benefit recorded was $2.1 million,
    $2.2 million and $1.0, respectively, in 2008, 2007 and
    2006. As of January 3, 2009, unrecognized compensation
    expense for RSU’s amounted to $15.8 million and this
    cost will be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.9 years.

    $5.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively.



Additionally, non-employee members of the Board of Directors
    received restricted share-based grants which must be cash
    settled and accordingly mark-to-market accounting is applied.
    The after-tax expense recognized for such grants amounted to
    $0.2 million in 2008, $0.4 million in 2007, and
    $0.5 million in 2006.

Long-Term
    Performance Awards:

Cyclical

3-year

Plans:

The Company has granted Long Term
    Performance Awards (“LTIPs”) under its 1997 and 2001
    Long Term Incentive Plans to senior management employees for
    achieving Company performance measures, specifically earnings
    per share and return on capital employed. Awards are payable in
    shares of common stock, which may be restricted if the employee
    has not achieved certain stock ownership levels, and generally
    no award is made if the employee terminates employment prior to
    the payout date. There are three award cycles in progress: one
    for the three year period ending in December, 2008, the second
    for the three year period ending in December, 2009, and the
    third for the three year period ending in December, 2010. The
    ultimate issuance of shares, if any, is determined based on
    performance in the final year of the cycle. Based on performance
    in fiscal 2008, a total of 27,031 shares will be issued to
    senior management in 2009.

Special Bonus Program:

In 2007, the Company
    adopted a special bonus program under its 1997 Long Term
    Incentive Plan. The program provides senior managers the
    opportunity to receive stock in the event certain working
    capital turn objectives are achieved by December 31, 2009
    and sustained for a period of at least six months. The ultimate
    issuances of shares, if any, will be determined based on
    performance during the performance period.

Expense recognized for the various performance-contingent grants
    amounted to $1.9 million in 2008, $1.5 million in 2007
    and $7.4 million in 2006. In the event performance goals
    are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any
    previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. A summary
    of the activity pertaining to the maximum number of shares that
    may be issued under both the Cyclical

3-year

Plans
    and the Special Bonus Program is as follows:

    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
    (“ESOP

”)  Substantially all
    U.S. employees may contribute from 1% to 15% of their
    eligible compensation to a tax-deferred 401(k) savings plan,
    subject to restrictions under tax laws. Employees generally
    direct the investment of their own contributions into various
    investment funds. An employer match benefit is provided under
    the plan equal to one-half of each employee’s tax-deferred
    contribution up to the first 7% of their compensation.
    Participants direct the entire employer match benefit such that
    no participant is required to hold the Company’s common
    stock in their 401(k) account. The



employer match benefit totaled $10.4 million,
    $8.4 million and $7.9 million, in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

In addition, approximately 4,100 U.S. salaried and
    non-union hourly employees receive a non-contributory benefit
    under the Cornerstone plan. Cornerstone benefit allocations
    range from 3% to 9% of eligible employee compensation based on
    age. Approximately 1,300 U.S. employees receive an
    additional average 1.7% contribution actuarially designed to
    replace previously curtailed pension benefits. Allocations for
    benefits earned under the Cornerstone plan were
    $15.6 million in 2008, $13.8 million in 2007, and
    $13.2 million in 2006. Assets held in participant
    Cornerstone accounts are invested in target date retirement
    funds which are age-based mix of investments.

Shares of the Company’s common stock held by the ESOP were
    purchased with the proceeds of external borrowings in 1989 and
    borrowings from the Company in 1991 (“1991 internal
    loan”). The external ESOP borrowings are guaranteed by the
    Company and are included in long-term debt. Shareowners’
    equity reflects a reduction equal to the cost basis of unearned
    (unallocated) shares purchased with the internal and the
    external borrowings.

The Company accounts for the ESOP under Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

76-3,

“Accounting Practices for Certain Employee Stock Ownership
    Plans”, as affected by the Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”)

89-8,

“Expense Recognition for Employee Stock Ownership
    Plans.” Net ESOP activity recognized is comprised of the
    cost basis of shares released, the cost of the aforementioned
    Cornerstone and 401(k) match defined contribution benefits,
    interest expense on the external 1989 borrowing, less the fair
    value of shares released and dividends on unallocated ESOP
    shares. Net ESOP expense was $10.6 million in 2008,
    $1.6 million in 2007 and $2.4 million in 2006. ESOP
    expense is affected by the market value of the Company’s
    common stock on the monthly dates when shares are released. The
    market value of shares released averaged $43.65 per share in
    2008, $56.04 per share in 2007 and $49.28 in 2006.

Unallocated shares are released from the trust based on current
    period debt principal and interest payments as a percentage of
    total future debt principal and interest payments. Dividends on
    both allocated and unallocated shares may be used for debt
    service and to credit participant accounts for dividends earned
    on allocated shares. Dividends paid on the shares acquired with
    the 1991 internal loan were used solely to pay internal loan
    debt service in all periods. Dividends on ESOP shares, which are
    charged to shareowners’ equity as declared, were
    $9.7 million in 2008, $11.0 million in 2007 and
    $11.7 million in 2006. Dividends on ESOP shares were
    utilized entirely for debt service in all years. Interest costs
    incurred by the ESOP on the 1989 external debt in 2008, 2007 and
    2006 were $0.2 million, $0.3 million and
    $0.3 million, respectively. Interest costs incurred by the
    ESOP on the 1991 internal loan, which have no earnings impact,
    were $8.4 million, $8.7 million and $9.2 million
    for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Both allocated and
    unallocated ESOP shares are treated as outstanding for purposes
    of computing earnings per share. As of January 3, 2009, the
    number of ESOP shares allocated to participant accounts was
    3,630,455 and the number of unallocated shares was 4,704,184. At
    January 3, 2009, there were 30,475 released shares in the
    ESOP trust holding account pending allocation. The Company made
    cash contributions to the ESOP totaling $15.6 million in
    2008, $11.7 million in 2007 and $11.2 million in 2006.

PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS

The Company
    sponsors pension plans covering most domestic hourly and certain
    executive employees, and approximately 4,300 foreign employees.
    Benefits are generally based on salary and years of service,
    except for U.S. collective bargaining employees whose
    benefits are based on a stated amount for each year of service.

The Company contributes to multi-employer plans for certain
    collective bargaining U.S. employees. In addition, various
    other defined contribution plans are sponsored worldwide. The
    expense for such defined contribution plans, aside from the
    earlier discussed ESOP plans, follows:

The Company provides medical and dental benefits for certain
    retired employees in the United States. In addition, certain
    U.S. employees who retire from active service are eligible
    for life insurance benefits. Approximately 7,500 participants
    are covered under these plans. Net periodic post-retirement
    benefit expense was $1.9 million in 2008, $2.2 million
    in 2007 and $2.7 million in 2006.

In 2008, the reduction of the projected benefit obligation for
    actuarial gains primarily pertains to increased discount rates
    used to measure the pension liabilities.



The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit
    pension plans was $366.3 million at January 3, 2009
    and $427.1 million at December 29, 2007. Information

The impact from recognizing the funded
    status of the defined benefit plans, representing the fair value
    of the plan assets versus the projected benefit obligation, was
    a decrease to Shareowners’ Equity of $61.1 million,
    net of $26.7 million tax benefit.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is
    determined considering the returns projected for the various
    asset classes and the relative weighting for each asset class as
    reflected in the target asset allocation below. In addition the
    Company considers historical performance, the opinions of
    outside actuaries and other data in developing the return
    assumption. The Company expects to use a weighted-average
    long-term rate of return assumption of 7.5% for the
    U.S. plans and 7.0% for the

non-U.S. plans

in the determination of fiscal 2009 net periodic benefit
    expense.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS

Plan assets are invested in
    equity securities, bonds and other fixed income securities,
    money market instruments and insurance contracts. The
    Company’s weighted-average worldwide actual asset
    allocations at January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007
    by asset category are as follows:

The Company’s investment strategy for pension plan assets
    includes diversification to minimize interest and market risks,
    and generally does not involve the use of derivative financial
    instruments. Plan assets are rebalanced periodically to maintain
    target asset allocations. Maturities of investments are not
    necessarily related to the timing of expected future benefit
    payments, but adequate liquidity to make immediate and medium
    term benefit payments is ensured.

CONTRIBUTIONS

The Company’s funding
    policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts
    determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current
    and future benefits in accordance with federal law and other
    regulations. The Company expects to contribute approximately
    $20 million to its pension and other post-retirement
    benefit plans in 2009.

EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS

Benefit
    payments, inclusive of amounts attributable to estimated future
    employee service, are expected to be paid as follows over the
    next 10 years:

(Millions of Dollars)

Years 6-10

Future payments

$288.2

$23.9

$24.6

$25.4

$26.8

$31.4

$156.1

These benefit payments will be funded through a combination of
    existing plan assets and amounts to be contributed in the future
    by the Company.

HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS

The weighted average annual
    assumed rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered
    benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) is assumed to be
    9.5% for 2009, reducing gradually to 6% by 2015 and remaining at
    that level thereafter. A one percentage point change in the
    assumed health care cost trend rate would have an immaterial
    effect on the net periodic post-retirement benefit cost and the
    post-retirement benefit obligation as of January 3, 2009.

N. FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted SFAS 157
    (as impacted by FSP’s

157-1

and

157-2)

in
    2008 with respect to (i) all applicable financial assets
    and liabilities and (ii) nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    the Company’s financial statements on a recurring basis (at
    least annually). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosure requirements about fair value. SFAS 157 requires
    the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and
    minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
    value. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from
    independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the
    Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs
    create the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments
    in active markets.

Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments
    in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived
    valuations whose inputs and significant value drivers are
    observable.

Level 3 – Instruments that are valued using
    unobservable inputs.

The Company holds various derivative financial instruments that
    are employed to manage risks, including foreign currency and
    interest rate exposures. These financial instruments are carried
    at fair value and are included within the scope of
    SFAS 157. The Company determines the fair value of
    derivatives through the use of matrix or model pricing, which
    utilizes verifiable inputs such as market interest and currency
    rates. When determining the fair value of these financial
    instruments for which Level 1 evidence does not exist, the
    Company considers various factors including the following:
    exchange or market price quotations of similar instruments, time
    value and volatility factors, the Company’s own credit
    rating and the credit rating of the counter-party.



The following table presents the fair value and the hierarchy
    levels, for financial assets and liabilities that are measured
    at fair value as of January 3, 2009 (in millions):

until fiscal 2009 relate to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized
    or disclosed on a nonrecurring basis. This deferral relates to
    such items as impairment testing for goodwill, other intangible
    and long-lived assets and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business
    combination.

    primarily comprised of intangible asset amortization expense,
    gains and losses on asset dispositions, currency impact,
    environmental expense and net expenses related to the Mac Tools
    extended financing programs, mainly financing receivable losses
    and interest income.

Research and development costs were $25.4 million,
    $24.5 million and $22.1 million for fiscal years 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

2008 Actions:

During 2008, the Company
    initiated cost reduction initiatives in order to maintain its
    cost competitiveness. A large portion of these actions were
    initiated in the fourth quarter as the Company responded to
    deteriorating business conditions resulting from the
    recessionary U.S. economic weakness and slowing global
    demand, primarily in its CDIY and Industrial segments. Severance
    charges of $70.0 million have been recorded relating to the
    reduction of approximately 2,700 employees. In addition to
    severance, $13.6 million in charges were recognized
    pertaining to asset impairments for production assets and real
    estate, and $0.7 million for facility closure costs. The
    $1.2 million in other charges stemmed from the termination
    of service contracts. Of the amount recorded in 2008,
    $29.8 million has been utilized to date, for a remaining
    reserve as of January 3, 2009 of $55.3 million. The
    Company will utilize a majority of these reserves in 2009, and
    estimates approximately 30% will be expended in 2010 primarily
    pertaining to the timing of approvals from European governmental
    agencies.



Pre-2008 Actions:

During 2007, the Company
    initiated $11.8 million of cost reduction actions in
    various businesses. These actions were comprised of severance
    for 525 employees and the exit of a leased facility. The
    remaining reserves were fully utilized in 2008.

Acquisition Related:

During 2008,
    $6.4 million of reserves were established related to the
    Company’s current year acquisitions. Of this amount
    $5.3 million was for severance and related costs for
    approximately 200 employees and $1.1 million related
    to the closure of nine branch facilities. As of January 3,
    2009, $2.2 million has been utilized, leaving
    $4.2 million remaining. The Company also utilized
    $12.5 million of restructuring reserves during 2008
    established for various prior year acquisitions, principally
    Facom and HSM. As of January 3, 2009, $8.4 million in
    accruals remain for the prior year acquisitions. Of this balance
    approximately $7 million pertains to Facom for which the
    timing of payments depends upon the actions of certain European
    governmental agencies.

Of the $35.6 million of restructuring and asset impairment
    charges noted above for the CDIY segment, $13.6 million is
    for asset impairments related to the current and planned closure
    of several facilities. There were no asset impairments for the
    Security and Industrial segments in 2008. Fair value for
    impaired production assets was based on the present value of
    discounted cash flows. This included an estimate for future cash
    flows as production activities are phased out as well as auction
    values (prices for similar assets) for assets where use has been
    discontinued or future cash flows are minimal. Real estate
    values are based on estimates of the Company’s anticipated
    sales values (less costs to sell) which have been based on sales
    of comparable properties and estimates from third party brokers.

Q.
    BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

The Security segment is a provider of access and security
    solutions primarily for retailers, educational, financial and
    healthcare institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and
    industrial customers. The Company provides an extensive suite of
    mechanical and electronic security products and systems, and a
    variety of security services. These include security integration
    systems, software, related installation, maintenance, monitoring
    services, automatic doors, door closers, exit devices, hardware
    and locking mechanisms. Security products are sold primarily on
    a direct sales basis and in certain instances, through third
    party distributors. The Industrial segment manufactures and
    markets: professional industrial and automotive mechanics tools
    and storage systems; engineered healthcare storage systems;
    hydraulic tools and accessories; plumbing, heating and air
    conditioning tools; assembly tools and systems; and specialty
    tools. These products are sold to industrial customers and
    distributed primarily through third party distributors as well
    as through direct sales forces. The Construction and
    Do-It-Yourself (“CDIY”) segment manufactures and
    markets hand tools, consumer mechanics tools, storage systems,
    and pneumatic tools and fasteners, as these products are
    principally utilized in construction and
    “Do-It-Yourself” projects. These products are sold to
    professional end users as well as consumers, and are distributed
    through retailers (including home centers, mass merchants,
    hardware stores, and retail lumber yards).

The Company utilizes segment profit, which is defined as net
    sales minus cost of sales and SG&A inclusive of the
    provision for doubtful accounts (aside from corporate overhead
    expense), and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to
    assess the profitability of each segment. Segment profit
    excludes the corporate overhead expense element of SG&A,
    interest income, interest expense,

other-net

(inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense),
    restructuring, and income tax expense. Refer to Note P,
    Restructuring and Asset Impairments for the amount of
    restructuring charges and asset impairments by segment, and to
    Note G,



Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for intangible amortization
    expense by segment. Corporate overhead is comprised of world
    headquarters facility expense, cost for the executive management
    team and cost for certain centralized functions that benefit the
    entire Company but are not directly attributable to the
    businesses, such as legal and corporate finance functions.
    Transactions between segments are not material. Segment assets
    primarily include accounts receivable, inventory, other current
    assets, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and
    other miscellaneous assets. Corporate assets and unallocated
    assets are cash and deferred income taxes. Geographic net sales
    and long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic regions
    based on the geographic location of each Company subsidiary.

The following information excludes the CST/berger laser leveling
    and measuring business, as well as three other smaller
    businesses, which are classified as discontinued operations as
    disclosed in Note U Discontinued Operations, unless
    otherwise noted.

In connection with its acquisitions, the Company recorded
    $21.6 million in cost of sales (“inventory

step-up

amortization”) during 2006 related to the initial turn of
    acquired inventory which was

written-up

in purchase accounting to its fair market value. This non-cash
    inventory

step-up

amortization amounted to $0.1 million in the Security
    segment, $8.2 million in the CDIY segment,
    $13.3 million in the Industrial segment. Inventory

step-up

amortization was not significant in 2008 and 2007.

Sales to The Home Depot were 13%, 16% and 18% of the CDIY
    segment net sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Valuation allowances reduced the deferred tax asset attributable

    based upon all available evidence, is more likely than not to be
    realized. Reversal of the valuation



allowance is contingent upon the recognition of future taxable
    income and capital gains in specific foreign countries and
    specific states, or changes in circumstances which cause the
    recognition of the benefits to become more likely than not. The
    U.S. federal, foreign and state loss carry-forwards expire
    in various years beginning in 2009 or have indefinite
    carry-forwards.

    tax holidays with Thailand and China. Tax holidays resulted in a
    reduction of tax expense amounting to $2.7 million in 2008,
    $4.3 million in 2007, and $3.1 million in 2006. The
    tax holiday in Thailand is in place until 2010 while the tax

The Company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely
    affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries
    where the statutory rates are lower. The Company is subject to
    the examination of its income tax returns by the Internal
    Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company evaluates
    the likelihood of unfavorable adjustments arising from the
    examinations and believes adequate provisions have been made in
    the income tax provision.

Undistributed foreign earnings of $737.9 million at
    January 3, 2009 are considered to be invested indefinitely
    or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax.
    Accordingly, no provision has been made for taxes that might be
    payable upon remittance of such earnings, nor is it practicable
    to determine the amount of this liability.

As of the beginning of the 2007 fiscal year, the Company adopted
    the provisions of FIN 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    SFAS 109”. The unrecognized tax benefits at
    January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 relate to
    U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions.

The following table summarizes the activity related to the
    unrecognized tax benefits:

Included in the unrecognized tax benefits of $43.1 million
    at January 3, 2009 and $49.1 million at
    December 29, 2007 were $37.7 million and
    $41.7 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would
    impact the annual effective tax rates. The accrual for potential
    penalties and interest related to these unrecognized tax
    benefits was increased by $1.3 million in tax year 2008 and
    $1.5 million in tax year 2007, and in total, a liability
    for potential penalties and interest of $5.5 million and
    $4.4 million has been recorded in tax years 2008 and 2007
    respectively. The Company classifies all tax-related interest
    and penalties as income tax expense.

It is reasonably possible the Company may recognize up to
    $8 - $12 million of currently unrecognized tax
    benefits over the next 12 months, pertaining primarily to
    expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions.

The Company files U.S., state, and foreign income tax returns in
    jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Tax years
    2005 and forward remain subject to federal examination while tax
    years 2005 and forward generally remain subject to examination
    by most state tax authorities. In significant foreign
    jurisdictions, tax years 2003 and forward generally remain
    subject to examination by their respective tax authorities.

S.
    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

COMMITMENTS

The Company has non-cancelable
    operating lease agreements, principally related to facilities,
    vehicles, machinery and equipment. Minimum payments have not
    been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $3.8 million
    due in the future under non-cancelable subleases. In addition,
    the Company is a party to a synthetic lease, which qualifies as
    an operating lease, for one of its major distribution centers.



Rental expense, net of sublease income, for operating leases was
    $66.4 million in 2008, $62.2 million in 2007 and
    $49.9 million in 2006.

Outsourcing and other commitments are comprised of:
    $6.9 million for outsourcing arrangements, primarily
    related to information systems and telecommunications; and
    $20.3 million in marketing obligations.

The Company has numerous assets, predominantly vehicles and
    equipment, under a one-year term U.S. master personal
    property lease. Residual value obligations under this master
    lease were $27.9 million at January 3, 2009 while the
    fair value of the underlying assets was approximately
    $32.1 million. The U.S. master personal property lease
    obligations are not reflected in the future minimum lease
    payments since the initial and remaining term does not exceed
    one year. The Company routinely exercises various lease renewal
    options and from time to time purchases leased assets for fair
    value at the end of lease terms.

The Company is a party to a synthetic lease for one of its major
    distribution centers. The program qualifies as an operating
    lease for accounting purposes, where only the monthly lease cost
    is recorded in earnings and the liability and value of
    underlying assets are off-balance sheet. As of January 3,
    2009, the estimated fair value of assets and remaining
    obligation for the property were $36.0 million and
    $29.9 million respectively.

The Company has guaranteed a portion of the residual value
    arising from its previously mentioned synthetic lease and
    U.S. master personal property lease programs. The lease
    guarantees aggregate $57.8 million while the fair value of
    the underlying assets is estimated at $68.1 million. The related
    assets would be available to satisfy the guarantee obligations
    and therefore it is unlikely the Company will incur any future
    loss associated with these lease guarantees.

The Company has issued $35.1 million in standby letters of
    credit that guarantee future payments which may be required
    under certain insurance programs. Shares of the Company’s
    common stock held by the ESOP were purchased with the proceeds
    of external borrowings in the 1980’s and borrowings from
    the Company in 1991. The external ESOP borrowings are guaranteed
    by the Company and are included in the current maturities of
    long-term debt. Shareowners’ equity reflects a reduction
    for the internal and external borrowings. The Company has sold
    various businesses and properties over many years and provided
    standard indemnification to the purchasers with respect to any
    unknown liabilities, such as environmental, which may arise in
    the future that are attributable to the time of the
    Company’s ownership. No liabilities have been recorded for
    these general indemnifications since there are no identified
    exposures. The Company provides various limited and full
    recourse guarantees to financial institutions that provide
    financing to U.S. and Canadian Mac Tool



distributors for their initial purchase of the inventory and
    truck necessary to function as a distributor. In addition, the
    Company provides a full recourse guarantee to a financial
    institution that extends credit to certain end retail customers
    of its U.S. Mac Tool distributors. The gross amount
    guaranteed in these arrangements is $16.2 million and the
    $15.2 million fair value of the guarantees issued is
    recorded in debt and other liabilities as appropriate in the
    consolidated balance sheet.

The Company provides product and service warranties which vary
    across its businesses. The types of warranties offered generally
    range from one year to limited lifetime, while certain products
    carry no warranty. Further, the Company sometimes incurs
    discretionary costs to service its products in connection with
    product performance issues. Historical warranty and service
    claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations
    recognized. Adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability
    as new information becomes available.

Following is a summary of the warranty liability activity for
    the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007:

T.
    CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings relating to
    environmental issues, employment, product liability,
    workers’ compensation claims and other matters. The Company
    periodically reviews the status of these proceedings with both
    inside and outside counsel, as well as an actuary for risk
    insurance. Management believes that the ultimate disposition of
    these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
    operations or financial condition taken as a whole.

The Company recognizes liabilities for contingent exposures when
    analysis indicates it is both probable that an asset has been
    impaired or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    impairment or loss can reasonably be estimated. When a range of
    probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most
    likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of
    probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the
    range is accrued.

In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in
    various lawsuits and claims. In addition, the Company is a party
    to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory
    agencies relating to environmental remediation. Also, the
    Company, along with many other companies, has been named as a
    potentially responsible party (“PRP”) in a number of
    administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste
    sites, including 15 active Superfund sites. Current laws
    potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each PRP.
    In assessing its potential liability at these sites, the Company
    has considered the following: whether responsibility is being
    disputed, the terms of existing agreements, experience at
    similar sites, and the Company’s volumetric contribution at
    these sites.

The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental
    investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability
    recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts
    with respect to each individual site and includes such factors
    as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations,
    and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The
    liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for
    recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and
    remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded
    are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
    technical and legal information that becomes available. As of
    January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, the Company had
    reserves of $28.8 million and $30.1 million,
    respectively, for remediation activities associated with
    Company-owned properties, as well as for Superfund sites, for
    losses that are probable and estimable. Of the 2008 amount,
    $7.1 million is classified as current and
    $21.7 million as long-term which is expected to be paid
    over the next



ten years. The range of environmental remediation costs that is
    reasonably possible is $19.1 million to $51.3 million
    which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be
    liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns.
    Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with
    policy.

The environmental liability for certain sites that have cash
    payments beyond the current year that are fixed or reliably
    determinable have been discounted using a rate of 3.9% to 4.4%,
    depending on the expected timing of disbursements. The
    discounted and undiscounted amount of the liability relative to
    these sites is $5.7 million and $7.3 million,
    respectively. The payments relative to these sites are expected
    to be $0.8 million in 2009, $1.7 million in 2010,
    $1.0 million in 2011, $0.3 million in 2012,
    $0.3 million in 2013 and $3.2 million thereafter.

The amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is
    based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically
    and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
    information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred
    in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the
    inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject
    to the imprecision in estimating future contingent liability
    costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to
    pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts
    recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or liquidity.

U.
    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On July 25, 2008, the Company sold its CST/berger laser
    leveling and measuring business to Robert Bosch Tool
    Corporation. The Company received cash proceeds of
    $196.7 million and recorded an $83.9 million after-tax
    gain as a result of the sale. Additionally, the Company sold
    three other smaller businesses for total cash proceeds of
    $7.9 million and a total after-tax loss of
    $0.3 million. Total goodwill allocated to the disposal of
    these businesses was $28.6 million. The divestures of these
    businesses were made pursuant to the Company’s growth
    strategy which entails a reduction of risk associated with
    certain large customer concentrations and better utilization of
    resources to increase shareowner value.

CST/berger, which was formally in the Company’s CDIY
    segment, manufactures and distributes surveying accessories as
    well as building and construction instruments primarily in the
    Americas and Europe. Two of the small businesses that were sold
    were part of the Security segment, while the third minor
    business was part of the Industrial segment.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets”, the results of operations of CST/berger and the
    three small businesses have been reported as discontinued
    operations. The operating results of the four divested
    businesses are summarized as follows:
