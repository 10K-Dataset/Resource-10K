1(b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

Financial information regarding the Company's business
segments is incorporated herein by reference to the material captioned
"Business Segment Results" in Item 7 and Note
P Business Segment and Geographic Area of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.

1(c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF
BUSINESS

The Company's operations are classified
into two business segments: Tools and Doors.

Tools

The Tools segment manufactures and markets carpenters,
mechanics, pneumatic and hydraulic tools as well as tool sets. These
products are sold to customers and distributed directly to retailers
(including home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail
lumber yards) as well as through third party distributors.

Carpenters tools include hand tools such as measuring
instruments, planes, hammers, knives and blades, screwdrivers, saws,
chisels, boring tools, masonry, tile and drywall tools, as well as
electronic stud sensors, levels, alignment tools and elevation
measuring systems. The Company markets its carpenters tools under the
Stanley®, FatMax®, MaxGrip

TM

, Powerlock®,
IntelliTools

TM

, Dynagrip®, and Goldblatt®
brands.

Mechanics tools include consumer, industrial and
professional mechanics hand tools, including wrenches, sockets,
electronic diagnostic tools, tool boxes and high-density industrial
storage and retrieval systems. Mechanics tools are marketed under the
Stanley®, Proto®, Mac®, Husky®, Jensen®,
Vidmar®, ZAG® and Blackhawk

TM

by Proto ®
brands.

Pneumatic tools include Bostitch® fastening
tools and fasteners (nails and staples) used for construction,
remodeling, furniture making, pallet manufacturing and consumer use and
pneumatic air tools marketed under the Stanley® brand (these are
high performance, precision assembly tools, controllers and systems for
tightening threaded fasteners used chiefly by vehicle
manufacturers).

Hydraulic tools include Stanley®
hand-held hydraulic tools used by contractors, utilities, railroads and
public works as well as LaBounty® mounted demolition hammers and
compactors designed to work on skid steer loaders, mini-excavators,
backhoes and large excavators.

Doors

The Doors
segment manufactures and markets automatic doors, as well as closet
doors and systems, home decor, door locking systems, commercial and
consumer hardware, security access control


systems and patient monitoring devices.
Products in the Doors segment include mirrored closet doors and closet
organizing systems, automatic doors as well as related door hardware
products ranging from hinges, hasps, bolts and latches to shelf
brackets and lock sets. Door products are marketed under the
Stanley®, Magic-Door®
Stanley-Acmetrack,
Monarch, Acme®, WanderGuard® ,
StanVision and BEST® brands and are sold
directly to end users and retailers as well as through third party
distributors.

Competition

The Company competes
on the basis of its reputation for product quality, its well-known
brands, its commitment to customer service and strong customer
relationships, the breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on
product innovation.

The Company encounters active
competition in all of its businesses from both larger and smaller
companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that
produce different products appropriate for the same uses. The Company
has a large number of competitors; however, aside from a small number
of competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware
business, who produce a range of products somewhat comparable to the
Company's, the majority of its competitors compete only with
respect to one or more individual products or product lines within a
particular line. The Company believes that it is one of the largest
manufacturers of hand tools in the world featuring a broader line than
any other toolmaker. The Company also believes that it is a leader in
the manufacture and sale of pneumatic fastening tools and related
fasteners to the construction, furniture and pallet industries as well
as a leading manufacturer of hand-held hydraulic tools used for heavy
construction, railroads, utilities and public works. In the Doors
segment, the Company believes that it is a U.S. leader in commercial
hardware products, mirrored closet doors and hardware for sliding,
folding and pocket doors and the U.S. leader in the manufacture, sale
and installation of automatic sliding and swing powered doors.

Customers

A substantial portion of the
Company's products are sold through home centers and mass
merchant distribution channels in the U.S. In 2003, approximately
16% of the Company's consolidated sales from continuing
operations in the Tools and Doors segments collectively were to one
customer. Because a consolidation of retailers in the home center and
mass merchant distribution channel is occurring, these customers
constitute a growing percent of the Company's sales and are
important to the Company's operating results. While this
consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these
large retailers provide the Company with opportunities for growth, the
increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a
certain degree of exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of this
one customer as well as certain of the other larger home centers as
customers would have a material adverse effect on each of the
Company's business segments until either such customers were
replaced or the Company made the necessary adjustments to compensate
for the loss of business.

Despite the trend toward
customer consolidation, the Company has a diversified customer base and
is seeking to broaden its customer base further in each business
segment by identifying and seeking new channels and customers that it
does not currently serve.

Raw Materials

The
Company's products are manufactured of steel and other metals,
wood and plastic. The raw materials required are available from a
number of sources at competitive prices and the Company has multi-year
contracts with many of its key suppliers. The Company has experienced
no difficulties in obtaining supplies in recent periods. Certain
commodity prices, particularly steel, are expected to increase in 2004,
but the Company does not anticipate difficulties with respect to
adequate supplies of raw materials.

Backlog

At
March 6, 2004, the Company had approximately $287 million in unfilled
orders compared with $168 million in unfilled orders at March 1, 2003.
All of these orders are reasonably expected to be


filled within the current fiscal year. Most
customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a result, the
Company produces primarily for inventory, rather than to fill specific
orders.

Patents and Trademarks

Neither business
segment is dependent, to any significant degree, on patents, licenses,
franchises or concessions and the loss of these patents, licenses,
franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on
either business segment. The Company owns numerous patents, none of
which are material to the Company's operations as a whole. These
patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. The Company
holds licenses, franchises and concessions, none of which individually
or in the aggregate is material to the Company's operations as a
whole. These licenses, franchises and concessions vary in duration from
one to 20 years.

The Company has numerous trademarks that
are used in its businesses worldwide. The STANLEY® and STANLEY in a
notched rectangle design trademarks are material to both business
segments. These well-known trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality
and value and are among the world's most trusted brand names. The
Company's tagline, "Make Something
Great" is the centerpiece of the
brand strategy for both segments. In the Tools segment, the
Bostitch®, Powerlock®, Tape Rule Case Design (Powerlock),
FatMax®, LaBounty®, MAC®, Proto®, Jensen®,
Goldblatt®, Husky®, Vidmar® and Zag® trademarks are
also material to the business. In the Doors segment, the BEST®
trademark is material to the business. The terms of these trademarks
vary from one to 20 years, with most trademarks being renewable
indefinitely for like terms.

Environmental Regulations

The Company is subject to various environmental laws and
regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries where it has operations.
Future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent
and will likely increase the Company's expenditures related to
environmental matters.

The Company is a party to a number
of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to
environmental remediation. Additionally, the Company, along with many
other companies, has been named as a potentially responsible party
("PRP") in a number of administrative
proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites, including ten
active Superfund sites.

Current laws potentially impose
joint and several liabilities upon each PRP. In assessing its potential
liability at these sites, the Company has considered the following: the
solvency of the other PRP's, whether responsibility is being
disputed, the terms of existing agreements, experience at similar
sites, and the fact that its volumetric contribution, if any, at these
sites is relatively small.

The Company's policy is
to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for
identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of
liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available
facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as
existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior
experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities
recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from
insurance or third parties. As assessments and remediation progress at
individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and
adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that
becomes available. As of January 3, 2004, the Company had reserves of
approximately $11.5 million, primarily for remediation activities
associated with Company-owned properties as well as for Superfund
sites, for losses that are probable and estimable.

The
amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on
estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to
reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes
available. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from
the estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating
environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating
future environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it
may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of
the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.


Employees

At January 3,
2004, the Company had approximately 13,500 employees, nearly 6,200 of
whom were employed in the U.S. Approximately 1,100 U.S. employees are
covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 14
different local labor unions who are, in turn, affiliated with
approximately 6 different international labor unions. The majority of
the Company's hourly-paid and weekly-paid employees outside the
U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The
Company's labor agreements in the U.S. expire in 2004, 2005, 2006
and 2007. With the exception of an eleven day strike in New Britain and
Farmington, Connecticut, there have been no significant interruptions
or curtailments of the Company's operations in recent years due
to labor disputes. The Company believes that its relationship with its
employees is good.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

The Company is a worldwide
producer of tools and door products for professional, industrial, and
consumer use. The Tools segment manufactures and markets carpenters,
mechanics, pneumatic and hydraulic tools as well as tool sets and tool
storage units. The Doors segment manufactures and markets automatic
doors, as well as closet doors and systems, home décor, door
locking systems, commercial and consumer hardware, security access
control systems and patient monitoring devices.

The Company has
embarked on a growth strategy which will likely alter its portfolio of
businesses in the future. This growth strategy encompasses acquisitions
and the reduction of risk associated with certain large customer
concentrations. The Company believes this strategy will improve the
overall profitability of operations. In 2003, acquisitions, primarily
Best Access which was completed in November 2002, had a significant
favorable impact on the Company. Additionally, the Company entered into
a definitive agreement during December 2003 to sell its residential
entry door business, and, therefore, this business has been reported as
a discontinued operation for all periods. The entry door business
contributed $0.13, $0.17, and $0.12 of diluted earnings per share in
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. As discussed in Note V Subsequent
Events of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15
of the Form 10-K, in the first quarter of 2004 the sale of the entry
door business, the acquisition of Chicago Steel Tape Co., and tender
offers for Blick plc and Frisco Bay Industries Ltd. were completed. The
three acquisitions are expected to offset the financial impact
associated with the sale of the entry door business.

The Company
announced restructuring plans ("Operation
15") in April 2003 to improve the profitability of certain
businesses. The restructuring was completed in 2003 and included a
workforce reduction of over 1,000 people, the exit from the Mac Tools
retail channel ("MacDirect"), and the
impairment of certain fixed assets and inventories related primarily to
the future consolidation of two distribution facilities. In the second
quarter of 2003, the Company recognized $8 million in charges related
to compensation payable to the former Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, John M. Trani, pertaining to his retirement effective December
31, 2003. These retirement costs were comprised of severance and
pension as specified in an employment contract entered into in
2000.

During 2003, the strengthening of the euro and other
foreign currencies had a significant favorable impact on the
translation of foreign currency-denominated operating results into U.S.
dollars. It is estimated that the favorable impact of foreign currency
translation contributed $0.13 of diluted earnings per share in
2003.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net sales from continuing
operations were $2,678 million for 2003, as compared to $2,384 million
in 2002, a 12% increase. Acquisitions contributed $266 million,
or an 11% increase of net sales. Organic sales volume declined
primarily due to the termination of the MacDirect program combined with
industrial and consumer channel customers inventory corrections in the
first half of 2003. These declines were partially offset by strong
fourth quarter 2003 demand in the U.S. Hand Tools and Mechanics Tools
businesses, and expanding service operations and share gains at
national accounts in the Access Technologies business. Overall, organic
sales volume declined 2%, offset by favorable foreign currency
translation of 3% due primarily to the European currencies.

Net sales from continuing operations were $2,384 million for 2002
which were relatively flat as compared to $2,394 million in 2001. Sales
in 2002 increased 2% from acquisitions, and 1% from the
translation of foreign currencies, which strengthened against the U.S.
dollar. Organic sales declined 3% principally due to the
negative impact of the Mechanics Tools plant consolidation, continued
overall price erosion, and ongoing weakness in industrial markets.

During 2003, the Company recorded $109 million of pre-tax
restructuring costs, impairment charges, and other exit costs in
connection with Operation 15. Certain expenses totaling $8 million
related to


the retirement of the Company's former
Chairman and CEO were recorded in addition to Operation 15 related
charges. A summary of the pre-tax charges recorded in 2003 related to
these matters is as follows:

These
charges were classified within the 2003 Consolidated Statement of
Operations as follows: (i)  Cost of sales — $20 million;
(ii) SG&A and Provision for doubtful accounts — $37 million;
(iii)  Other-net — $10 million; and (iv) Restructuring and
asset impairment charges — $53 million.

During 2002, the
Company reported a second quarter U.S. pension settlement pre-tax gain
of $18 million. Also in the second quarter, the Company incurred $8
million in severance and related expenses associated with selling,
general and administrative cost reductions. In the third quarter, the
Company reported a $6 million income tax credit related to a favorable
foreign tax development. In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded
$22 million in non-cash charges for increased inventory and receivable
loss provisions and for specific manufacturing equipment impairments
related to the following: (1) a reassessment of Mac Tools inventory and
accounts receivable valuations, as a result of a new retail control
system; (2) an inventory valuation adjustment in Fastening Systems
associated with cost estimation process improvements; and (3)
impairment of certain fixed assets related primarily to the Wichita
Falls and Dallas, Texas plants consolidation. Also in the fourth
quarter the Company recorded $5.6 million of accounting corrections.
These corrections relate primarily to expense capitalization and
depreciation. Other significant credits in 2002 include $11 million in
environmental income arising from a settlement with an insurance
carrier recognized in the third and fourth quarters. These credits and
charges were classified within the 2002 Consolidated Statement of
Operations as follows: (i) Net sales — $1 million charge; (ii)
Cost of sales — $17 million charge; (iii) SG&A expenses
— $10 million charge; (iv) Other-net — $21 million credit;
and (v) Income taxes — $6 million credit.

During 2001, the
Company recorded charges related to restructuring initiatives totaling
$72 million ($18 million incurred in the first quarter and $54 million
incurred in the fourth quarter). These costs consisted primarily of
severance and asset impairments as the Company continued to rationalize
its cost structure and reduce employment. In addition, the Company
incurred certain other significant credits and charges during 2001. In
the first quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax $29 million pension
curtailment gain pertaining to its U.S. pension plan. Also in the first
quarter, the Company recorded $11 million of charges related to several
business repositionings. The repositionings were principally in the
Tools segment and related to the continuing movement of production,
permanent reduction of the overhead cost structure of its manufacturing
system, and a series of initiatives at Mac Tools. In the third quarter,
the Company recorded a charge of $5 million for severance costs
incurred due to lower sales volumes and the continuing weakness in the
industrial markets. Also in the third quarter, the Company recorded $3
million in credits for tax benefits. In the fourth quarter, the Company
recorded a charge of $6 million for the disposition of inventories
associated principally


with  discontinued manufacturing plants
and stock-keeping-units (SKUs). These credits and charges were
classified within the 2001 Consolidated Statement of Operations as
follows: (i) Net sales — $1 million charge; (ii) Cost of sales
— $12 million charge; (iii) SG&A expenses — $8 million
charge; (iv) Other-net — $28 million credit; (v)
Restructuring and asset impairments — $72 million charge; and
(vi) Income taxes — $3 million credit.

The Company
reported gross profit from continuing operations of $893 million, or
33.3% of net sales, in 2003, compared to $790 million, or
33.1% of net sales, in 2002. Excluding the $128 million
favorable impact of acquisitions, gross profit declined slightly as
compared with 2002 primarily due to reduced organic sales volume
mentioned previously, inventory losses related to the exit of
MacDirect, the impairment of inventories related to the future
consolidation of two distribution facilities, and higher retirement
plan costs. These negatives were partially offset by favorable material
and other productivity variances. The Company anticipates significant
commodity inflation in 2004, particularly for steel materials, which is
expected to be offset by other productivity improvements.

In
2002, the Company reported gross profit from continuing operations of
$790 million, or 33.1% of net sales compared to $861 million or
36.0% of net sales in 2001. The decline in 2002 gross profit is
attributed to the following matters: (i) the costs associated with the
consolidation of two Mechanics Tools manufacturing plants, related
production inefficiencies and sales declines due to related plant
supply chain problems; (ii) consumer business price erosion due to the
continued customer mix shift towards home centers and mass merchants;
(iii) Fastening Systems price erosion associated with intensified
generic nail competition as well as a strategy shift to large
distributors and away from smaller customers; (iv) a reduction in
Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) related inventory benefit in 2002 versus
2001; (v) increased inventory loss provisions; (vi) and lower
retirement plan income. These issues were offset, to some extent, by
favorable material and other productivity variances, as well as
acquisitions which contributed approximately $22 million to gross
profit in 2002. Included in gross profit for 2002 were $13 million of
charges related to MacDirect and Fastening Systems inventories. Gross
profit in 2001 included $13 million of charges related to business
repositioning initiatives within the Tools segment and the disposition
of inventories principally from discontinued manufacturing plants and
SKUs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)
from continuing operations, inclusive of the provision for doubtful
accounts, were $638 million, or 23.8% of net sales in 2003,
compared to $526 million, or 22.1% of net sales, in the prior
year. The increase relates to $70 million of incremental expenses from
acquisitions, $25 million of receivable losses associated with the
MacDirect exit, $8 million of costs related to the retirement of the
Company's CEO, higher retirement plan costs, and the negative
impact from foreign currency translation.

SG&A expenses from
continuing operations were $526 million or 22.1% of net sales in
2002 compared to $553 million or 23.1% of net sales in 2001. The
Company reduced spending in many functions, particularly selling
expenses in Mac Tools as a result of lower retail distributor
headcount. There was a $12 million decline in the provision for
doubtful accounts mainly attributable to a decrease in Mac Tools
provisions due to lower sales as compared with 2001 and the mix shift
from retail to wholesale sales which involve reduced credit risk. These
favorable items more than offset a decrease in retirement plan income
in 2002. Included in SG&A for 2002 is $10 million in charges from
severance and related expenses ($8 million) and Mac Tools receivable
losses ($2 million). SG&A expenses in 2001 included $8 million in
charges from business repositioning and additional severance charges
apart from the restructuring initiatives.

Net interest expense
from continuing operations for 2003 was $28 million, an increase of $4
million from $24 million in 2002. This increase was from higher
borrowings primarily for acquisitions, partially offset by lower
interest rates. Net interest expense from continuing operations for
2002 was $24 million, down slightly from $26 million in 2001. The
decrease was a result of lower interest rates and weighted average debt
levels in 2002.

Other-net from continuing operations was $40
million in expense for 2003 compared to $9 million in income for 2002.
The increase is primarily the result of an $18 million gain in 2002
from the U.S. pension settlement, $12 million of higher losses in 2003
related to the Company's MacAdvantage


financing program, a $6 million loss on the
sale of the Mac Tools distributor receivable portfolio in 2003,
increased intangible amortization expense of $10 million in 2003
associated with acquisitions, and $11 million in income from an
environmental settlement with an insurance carrier in 2002, which was
offset by a $2 million increase in other environmental expense.

Other-net from continuing operations was $9 million in income for
2002 and 2001, however, there were some significant charges and credits
that were recorded in each year. The 2002 amount includes an $18
million gain from the U.S. pension settlement, $8 million in fixed
asset impairment losses, and $11 million in income from an
environmental settlement with an insurance carrier, which was offset by
a $2 million increase in other environmental expense. The 2001 amount
includes a $29 million U.S. pension plan curtailment gain and a charge
of $2 million related to Mac Tools business repositionings. There was
no goodwill amortization expense in 2002, due to adoption of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 "Goodwill
and Intangible Assets", while goodwill amortization was $8
million in 2001.

The Company's effective income tax rate
from continuing operations for 2003 was 27% as compared to
32% for 2002 and 33% for 2001. The tax rate decreases
reflect the continued benefit of a higher percentage of taxable income
in countries with lower statutory rates, primarily in Europe, Israel,
and the Far East. The 2003 effective income tax rate was affected
further by the tax benefit from the Operation 15 charges which were
predominately U.S. based. The 2003 and 2002 income taxes reflect
favorable foreign tax developments that reduced income taxes by $2
million and $6 million, respectively. The 2002 favorable development
was offset by the impact of non-deductible excise tax associated with
the termination of the defined benefit pension plan. In addition, the
Company recorded a non-recurring tax benefit in 2001 amounting to $3
million.

Business Segment Results

The Company utilizes
operating profit, which is defined as Net sales minus Cost of sales and
SG&A, inclusive of the Provision for doubtful accounts, and its
percentage of Net sales as measurements to evaluate the profitability
of each segment.

Tools

Tools
sales in 2003 increased 1% as compared to 2002. The sales volume
increased slightly as a result of strong fourth quarter 2003 demand in
the U.S. Hand Tools and Mechanics Tools businesses and favorable
foreign currency translation due primarily to the European currencies,
offset partially by declining sales from the termination of the
MacDirect program, and industrial and consumer channel customers
inventory corrections in the first half of 2003. Tools operating profit
was impacted by the charges previously mentioned totaling $55 million
in 2003 and $28 million in 2002. The remaining $19 million decrease in
operating profit is primarily due to higher retirement plan costs,
shift in business mix, and additional price erosion in 2003.

Tools sales declined 2.7% in 2002 as compared to 2001. The
sales decrease was mainly the result of price erosion and unfavorable
channel mix in several businesses, and the Mechanics Tools plant
consolidation previously mentioned, offset by $23 million in higher
sales from acquisitions. Tools operating profit was impacted by the
charges previously mentioned totaling $28 million in 2002 and $15
million in 2001. The remaining $45 million decline in operating profit
was primarily attributable to the previously detailed Mechanics Tools
domestic plant consolidation and internal product sourcing matters,
price concessions in the consumer and Fastening Systems businesses,
lower Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) related inventory valuation change in
2002 as compared with 2001, and increased inventory loss provisions.
Cost structure improvements including shifting production to low cost
countries and SG&A cost reductions were more than offset by the
above items.


Doors

Doors
sales from continuing operations increased by $274 million in 2003, a
64% increase. Acquisitions, primarily Best Access, contributed
$255 million, or a 59% increase of net sales. The organic sales
volume increased due to expanding service operations and share gains at
national accounts in the Access Technologies business. Acquired
companies contributed $55 million to operating profit in 2003, offset
to some extent by higher retirement plan costs.

Doors sales
increased 11.2% in 2002, primarily due to the Best Access and
Senior Technologies acquisitions. Increases in Hardware and Access
Technologies organic sales were offset by declines in Home Decor.
Operating profit was 12.8% of net sales as compared to
10.8% for 2001. Acquired companies contributed $8 million to
operating profit in 2002. The remaining increase in operating profit
reflects favorable production costs in low cost countries and lower
SG&A expenses. The severance charges related to the Doors segment
were $1 million in 2002 and $5 million in 2001.

Restructuring
Activities

In 2003, the Company recorded $50 million in
restructuring and asset impairment charges for the Operation 15
initiative. These charges consisted of $12 million for severance, $27
million of asset impairments and $11 million of other exit costs
related to the exit from the Company's MacDirect retail channel.
The asset impairments generally relate to assets which are idle mainly
as a result of restructuring initiatives and accordingly their book
value has been written down to fair value. The Company also recorded
$67 million in charges for other exit costs and CEO retirement costs.
These charges include $13 million in impaired inventories related to
the planned closure of a U.S. distribution facility, $8 million in
SG&A for compensation and benefit costs associated with the
CEO's retirement, $3 million in other SG&A charges, and $43
million of costs related to the Company's exit from the MacDirect
retail channel.

In the first quarter of 2003, the Company
recorded $3 million in restructuring reserves for new initiatives,
mainly in the Tools segment, pertaining to the further reduction of its
cost structure, primarily for severance-related obligations.

In
June 2002 and September 2001, $8 million and $5 million in severance
charges were recorded, respectively, as the Company continued to
rationalize its headcount to provide further SG&A expense
reductions. These charges were classified within SG&A expense in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These actions resulted in
the termination of approximately 200 selling and administrative
employees in each year. As of December 28, 2002, no accrual remained as
all of the severance has been expended.

In 2001, the Company
undertook initiatives to reduce its cost structure and executed several
business repositionings intended to improve its competitiveness. These
actions resulted in the closure of 13 facilities and a net employment
reduction of approximately 2,200 production, selling and administrative
people. As a result, the Company recorded $72 million of restructuring
and asset impairment charges. The charges for asset impairments were
primarily related to manufacturing and other assets that were retired
and disposed of as a result of manufacturing facility
closures.


At January 3, 2004, the restructuring and
asset impairment reserve balance was $16 million, which the Company
expects to be fully expended by the end of 2004. A summary of the
Company's restructuring reserves for the years ended December 28,
2002 to January 3, 2004 is as
follows:

As
of January 3, 2004, 86 manufacturing and distribution facilities have
been closed as a result of the restructuring initiatives since 1997. In
2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 1,100, 1,000 and 2,100 employees
have been terminated as a result of restructuring initiatives,
respectively. Severance payments of $18 million, $26 million and $42
million and other exit payments of $10 million, $4 million and $4
million were made in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Write-offs of
impaired assets were $18 million, $6 million and $8 million in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity, Sources and Uses of Capital

The Company's
primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and
borrowings under various credit facilities. The Company has
historically generated strong cash flows from operations. In 2003, cash
flow from operations was $464 million, as compared to $285 million in
2002. The increase is the result of working capital improvements from
receivables of $22 million and inventories of $24 million, cash
proceeds of approximately $40 million from the sale of the Mac Tools
distributor receivable portfolio, income tax payment deferrals and
refunds aggregating $57 million, and $17 million in lower cash payments
related to restructuring and other charges in 2003 versus 2002.

In 2002, cash flows from operations were $285 million as compared to
$222 million in 2001. In 2002, the Company received a gross pension
settlement of $115 million; an ongoing U.S. defined contribution plan
was pre-funded with $29 million, and excise and income taxes totaling
$48 million were paid, providing a net $38 million cash inflow from the
pension settlement. Additionally, the Company renegotiated its payment
practices with a major customer enabling acceleration of accounts
receivable collections by approximately $30 million. Cash payments
related to restructuring and other charges of $42 million in 2002 were
comparable to 2001.

Capital expenditures were $52 million in
2002 as compared to $73 million in 2001. The Company incurred higher
capital expenditures in 2001 for "The Stanley Learning
Center" (a major addition at world headquarters for the
training and development of employees), investment in various plants
including movement of production to low cost countries, and increased
costs for software development and acquisitions as the Company expanded
the infrastructure of its systems.

During 2003, the Company made
$260 million in payments on borrowings. In the second quarter of 2003,
the Company repurchased 3.9 million shares of common stock and agreed
to settle the remainder of its equity hedge through the repurchase of
4.1 million shares over the next four years. The 3.9 million share
repurchase was made with $100 million of cash and increased commercial
paper borrowings while the 4.1 million share repurchase involved $113
million of term debt. These


repurchases of shares under the equity hedge
contract, repayment of debt and currency fluctuation, resulted in a $20
million decrease in the Company's short-term and long-term
borrowings.

In 2002, the Company received $338 million in net
proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, and disbursed $356 million
for business acquisitions. The Company made $154 million in payments on
borrowings. These debt proceeds and repayments, in addition to debt
issuance costs and currency fluctuations, resulted in a $220 million
increase in the Company's short-term and long-term
borrowings.

The Company has unused short (364 day) and long-term
(multi-year) credit arrangements with several banks to borrow up to
$350 million at the lower of prime or money market rates. Of this
amount, $100 million is long-term. In addition, the Company has
short-term lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating $67
million, of which the entire amount was available at January 3, 2004.
Short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal. Of the
long-term and short-term lines, $350 million is available to support
the Company's commercial paper program. In addition to these
lines of credit, the Company maintains a facility designed for the
securitization of certain trade accounts receivable for purposes of
additional liquidity. As of January 3, 2004, the Company's
maximum available funds under this arrangement were $87 million, of
which the Company had utilized $54 million.

The Company also has
numerous assets, predominantly vehicles and equipment, under a one-year
term renewable U.S. master personal property lease. Residual value
obligations, which approximate the fair value of the related assets,
under this master lease were $35 million at January 3, 2004. The
Company does not anticipate any material liabilities associated with
these transactions.

The following summarizes the Company's
significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its
liquidity.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

Included
in the table above are $3 million of unconditional purchase commitments
for the entry door business that were assumed by the buyer upon the
sale of this discontinued operation in March, 2004. Other long-term
obligations primarily relate to deferred compensation commitments to
executives.

OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Short-term
borrowings, long-term debt and lines of credit are explained in detail
within Note I Long Term Debt and Financing Arrangements of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
Operating leases and other commercial commitments are explained in
detail in Note R Commitments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.


The Company believes that its dividend is
an important factor in generating returns for its shareowners. The
Company's stated long term policy is to increase dividends by
approximately one-half the Company's earnings growth rate,
ultimately reaching a dividend payout ratio of 25%. Dividend
increases are considered periodically in light of this policy and other
considerations. Dividends increased 4.0% in 2003, 5.3% in
2002 and 4.4% in 2001. The Company plans to use a significant
portion of free cash flow (operating cash flow less dividends and
capital expenditures) to fund future acquisitions in commercial and
industrial markets.

Market Risk

Market risk is the
potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the
fair value of financial instruments. The Company is exposed to market
risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates. Exposure to foreign currency risk results because the Company,
through its global businesses, enters into transactions and makes
investments denominated in multiple currencies. The Company's
predominant exposures are in European, Canadian and Asian currencies.
Certain cross-currency trade flows arising from sales and procurement
activities are consolidated prior to obtaining risk protection,
primarily purchased options. The Company is thus able to capitalize on
its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting
exposures to reduce the cost of purchasing protection. At times, the
Company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased
options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional
currency denominated receivables and payables, predominately affiliate
transactions. Gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset
the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures, assets and
liabilities being hedged. Management determines the nature and extent
of currency hedging activities, and in certain cases, may elect to
allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged. The Company has
also entered into several cross-currency interest rate swaps, to
provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries
and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service
requirements. Sensitivity to foreign currency exposure risk from these
financial instruments at the end of 2003 would have been immaterial
based on the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical
10% adverse movement in all currencies.

The
Company's exposure to interest rate risk results from its
outstanding debt obligations, short-term investments and derivative
financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio.
The debt portfolio is managed to achieve capital structure targets and
reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed
and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps, caps and
cross-currency interest rate swaps. The Company's primary
exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the
U.S. and Europe and is fairly represented by changes in LIBOR rates. At
January 3, 2004, the result of a hypothetical one percentage point
increase in short-term LIBOR rates would not have resulted in a
material impact on the pre-tax profit of the Company.

Fluctuations in the fair value of the Company's common stock
affect ESOP expense as well as diluted shares outstanding as discussed
in the U.S. Pension and ESOP section of Management Discussion and
Analysis.

The Company has access to financial resources and
borrowing capabilities around the world. There are no material
instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment
requirements due to a change in credit rating, and no significantly
restrictive covenants. The Company believes that its strong financial
position, operating cash flows and borrowing capacity provide the
financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual
dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its businesses, to
make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed
by its growth strategy.

OTHER MATTERS

Environmental

The Company incurs costs related to
environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations
governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously
contaminated sites. Future laws


and regulations are expected to be
increasingly stringent and will likely increase the Company's
expenditures related to routine environmental matters.

The
Company accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and
remediation efforts in accordance with appropriate accounting
guidelines which address probability and the ability to reasonably
estimate future costs. The liabilities are reassessed whenever
circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their
costs can be better estimated. Subject to the imprecision in estimating
future environmental costs, the Company believes that any sum it may
pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts
recorded will not have a materially adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. Refer to Note T
Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 15 of this Form 10-K for further information on environmental
liabilities and related cash flows.

U.S. Pension and
ESOP

In June 2002, the Company recorded an $18 million pre-tax
pension settlement gain in other-net. This involved the termination and
settlement of the primary U.S. salaried employee plan as well as
settlement of most of the liabilities in the ongoing plan for hourly
employees. In addition to the settlement gain, the Company recorded $8
million of operating income related to these plans in 2002, whereas in
2003 the ongoing hourly plan resulted in $2 million of expense.

As detailed in Note M Employee Benefit Plans of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K, the
Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) under which the
ongoing U.S. defined contribution and 401(k) plans are funded. Overall
ESOP expense is affected by the market value of Stanley stock on the
monthly dates when shares are released. In 2003, the market value of
shares released averaged $29.30 per share and the net ESOP expense was
$9 million. In 2002, the market value of shares released averaged
$39.62 per share and the net ESOP expense was negligible.

The
Company provides a 5% guaranteed rate of return on participant
contributions made to the tax deferred savings plan (401K) prior to
July 1998 when all contributions were invested in Stanley common stock.
The value of the shares participants purchased prior to July 1998 along
with the 5% cumulative guaranteed rate of return on Stanley
common stock is known as an Investment Protection Account (IPA).
Beginning in July 1998 the investment options for plan participant
contributions were enhanced to include a variety of investment funds in
addition to the Company's common stock, and there is no
guaranteed rate of return to participants on any contributions made
after that time. The IPA guarantee is included in the actuarial
valuation of the ongoing U.S. pension plan. Payments related to the IPA
guarantees, if they have any value, would be made to participants over
a period of many years generally as they retire. In the event the
market value of Stanley common stock declines, additional costs may be
triggered by the IPA benefit guarantee.

New Accounting
Standards

Refer to Note A Significant Accounting Policies of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form
10-K for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the
potential impact to the Company's consolidated results of
operations and financial position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
ESTIMATES

Preparation of the Company's financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of
the Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note A
Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Management believes
the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the
need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent
uncertainty. The most significant areas involving management estimates
are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from
management's estimates.


Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

Stanley's estimate for its allowance for doubtful
accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods. The
amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine
the total amount reserved. First, the Company evaluates specific
accounts where information indicates the customers may have an
inability to meet financial obligations, such as bankruptcy. In these
cases, the Company uses its judgment, based on the best available facts
and circumstances, to record a specific reserve for those customers
against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to
be collected. These specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as
additional information is received. Second, a reserve is established
for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to
receivables aging categories. These percentages are based on historical
collection and write-off experience.

If circumstances change,
for example the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a
material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its
financial obligation to the Company, estimates of the recoverability of
receivable amounts due could be reduced.

Inventories —
Lower of Cost or Market, Slow Moving and Obsolete

U.S.
inventories are generally valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market.
The calculation of LIFO reserves, and therefore the net inventory
valuation, is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory
components. The Company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of
cost or market, and continually reviews the book value of discontinued
product lines and SKUs to determine that these items are properly
valued. The Company identifies these inventories and assesses the
ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost. If it is
determined that cost is less than market value, then cost is used for
inventory valuation. If market value is less than cost, then the
Company writes down the related inventory to that value. If a write
down to the current market value is necessary, the market value cannot
be greater than the net realizable value, or ceiling (defined as
selling price less costs to complete and dispose), and cannot be lower
than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin, also called
the floor. The Company also continually evaluates the composition of
its inventory and identifies obsolete and/or slow-moving inventories.
Inventory items identified as obsolete and/or slow-moving are evaluated
to determine if reserves are required. If the Company is not able to
achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at
its current value, reserves would have to be adjusted accordingly.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company completed
acquisitions in 2003 and 2002 valued at $23 million and $359 million,
respectively. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are
recorded under the purchase method at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values
assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. The
Company had recorded goodwill of $433 million at January 3, 2004.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to
annual impairment testing. The identification and measurement of
goodwill and unamortized intangibles impairment involves the estimation
of the fair value of reporting units. The estimates of fair value of
reporting units are based on the best information available at the date
of assessment, which primarily incorporate management assumptions about
future cash flows. Future cash flows can be affected by changes in
industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which
anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired
entities. While the Company has not recorded intangibles impairment
losses in several years, it is possible impairments may occur in the
future in the event expected cash flows change significantly.
Specifically, the Specialty Tools and Fastening Systems reporting units
have been experiencing operating margin declines due to the depressed
technology industry and intensified competition, respectively. In
recent quarters, however, Fastening Systems operating margins have
begun to improve. Specialty Tools and Fastening Systems had $73 million
and $38 million, respectively, of recorded goodwill at January 3, 2004.
There is potential for future goodwill impairment losses if Specialty
Tools and Fastening Systems projected


profits and cash flows significantly decline
from current levels. See Note G Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this
Form 10-K for further discussion.

Property, Plant and Equipment
(PP&E)

The Company generally values PP&E at historical
cost less accumulated depreciation. Impairment losses are recorded when
indicators of impairment, such as plant closures, are present and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are
less than the carrying amount. The impairment loss is quantified by
comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average
discounted cash flows, which consider various possible outcomes for the
disposition of the assets (i.e. sale, leasing, etc.). Primarily as a
result of plant rationalization, certain facilities and equipment are
not currently used in operations. The Company has recorded impairment
losses related to unused assets and additional such losses may
potentially occur in the future.

Risk Insurance

To some
extent, the Company self insures for various business exposures. For
domestic workers' compensation and product liability, the Company
generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for catastrophic
losses ("stop loss" insurance). The two risk
areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are
workers' compensation and product liability (liability for
alleged injuries associated with the Company's products).
Actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form
the basis for workers' compensation and product liability loss
reserves recorded. The actuary contemplates the Company's
specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends
among statistical and other factors to determine the range of estimated
reserve required. Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific
reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for
development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet
reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are
quantified by third party administrator specialists (insurance
companies) for workers' compensation and by in-house legal
counsel in consultation with outside attorneys for product liability.
The cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to
occur over approximately 8 to 10 years, and the present value of
expected claim payments is reserved. The Company believes the liability
recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of January 3, 2004 is
adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is
possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate.

Income Taxes

The future tax benefit arising from net
deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is $84 million
at January 3, 2004 and $108 million at December 28, 2002. Management
believes earnings during the periods when the temporary differences
become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future
income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date
of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that
realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. The
valuation allowance as of January 3, 2004 amounted to $21 million.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company
estimates future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing
tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss
carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can
be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and
future taxable income levels. In the event the Company were to
determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its
deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would reduce such
amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that
determination is made. Conversely, if the Company were to determine
that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future
in excess of the net carrying amounts, the Company would decrease the
recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the
period in which that determination is made. See Note Q Income Taxes of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this
Form 10-K for further discussion.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS

The Company's off-balance sheet arrangements
include the following:


Receivable Securitizations

The
Company has agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, pools of accounts
and notes receivables to a Qualified Special Purpose Entity (QSPE),
which qualifies to be accounted for as an unconsolidated subsidiary.
The entity is designed to facilitate the securitization of certain
trade accounts receivable. Assets and related debt off-balance sheet
were both $54 million at January 3, 2004. The Company is responsible
for servicing these accounts while the QSPE bears the risk of
non-collection. The proceeds from sales of eligible receivables to the
QSPE were $21 million in 2003. There were no gains or losses on these
sales.

In 2003 the Company acquired a third party's
interest in a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) which supports the Mac Tools
extended financing programs. As a result, the entity became
non-qualifying and the net assets which consist primarily of notes
receivable of $56.4 million at January 3, 2004 have been consolidated
in the Company's balance sheet. No gains or losses related to
sales to the Company were recorded. During 2003, the Company sold
approximately $40 million of receivables of this portfolio to a third
party.

Synthetic Leases

The Company is a party to
synthetic leasing programs for two of its major distribution centers.
The programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, where
only the monthly lease amount is recorded in the income statement and
the liability and value of underlying assets are off-balance sheet. The
reasons for these programs are primarily to reduce overall cost and to
retain flexibility. As of January 3, 2004, the estimated fair values of
assets and remaining obligations for these two properties were $37
million and $28 million, respectively.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

EQUITY
COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION

Compensation plans under which
the Company's equity securities are authorized for issuance at
January 3, 2004
follow:

(a)

There
is a non-qualified deferred tax savings plan for highly compensated
salaried employees which mirrors the qualified plan provisions but was
not specifically approved by security holders. U.S. employees are
eligible to contribute from 1% to 15% of their salary to
a tax deferred savings plan as described in the Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP) section of Item 15 Note M


Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. The Company contributes an
amount equal to one-half of the employee contribution up to the first
7% of their salary, all of which is invested in Stanley common
stock for qualified employees. The same matching arrangement is
provided for highly compensated salaried employees in the
"non-qualified" plan, except that the
arrangement for these employees is outside of the ESOP, and is not
funded in advance of distributions. Shares of the Company's
common stock may be issued at the time of a distribution from the plan.
The number of securities remaining available for issuance under the
plan at January 3, 2004 is not determinable, since the plan does not
authorize a maximum number of securities.

ITEM
13.    CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

None.

assets, which consist of net notes receivable of $56.4 million at
January 3, 2004, have been consolidated in the Company's balance
sheet. Other-net in the 2003 Consolidated Statement of Operations
includes $24.5 million of financing receivable losses for these
programs, including $9.7 million pertaining to the exit from the Mac
Tools retail channel. The related allowance for doubtful accounts of
$14.8 million at January 3, 2004 for the Mac Tools extended financing

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The
Shareowners

The Stanley Works

We have audited the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Stanley Works and
subsidiaries as of January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, and the
related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Changes in
Shareowners' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended January 3, 2004. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The
Stanley Works and subsidiaries at January 3, 2004 and December 28,
2002, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 3,
2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note G to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, effective December 30, 2001, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries which
require consolidation, after the elimination of intercompany accounts
and transactions. The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday
nearest to December 31. There were 53 weeks in fiscal year 2003 and 52
weeks in fiscal years 2002 and 2001.

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as certain financial
statement disclosures. While management believes that the estimates and
assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are
appropriate, actual results could differ from these estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

For foreign operations with
functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability
accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses
are translated using weighted average exchange rates. Resulting
translation adjustments, as well as gains and losses from certain
intercompany transactions, are reported in a separate component of
shareowners' equity. Translation adjustments for operations in
highly inflationary economies and exchange gains and losses on
transactions are included in earnings, and amounted to net
(gains)/losses for 2003, 2002 and 2001 of $(4.8) million, $0.6 million
and $(3.3) million, respectively.

Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less are considered cash equivalents.

Accounts
Receivable

Trade receivables are stated at gross invoice amount
less discounts, other allowances, returns and provision for
uncollectible accounts. The Company extends long-term credit to
customers to fund the Mac Advantage financing program and also provides
long-term secured financing to Mac Tools wholesale distributors.
Interest on these loans accrues until the loan becomes delinquent,
typically when payments are 120 days past due, at which the time they
are written off. Payments received related to these loans subsequent to
being written off are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for
doubtful accounts. The net activity of the Mac Tools extended financing
programs is classified in Other-net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company
estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts using two methods. First,
a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where
information is available that customers may have an inability to meet
financial obligations. Second, a reserve is determined for all
customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories.
These percentages are based on historical collection and write-off
experience. Actual write offs are charged against the allowance when
internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful, generally when
payments are more than 120 days past due.

Inventories

U.S. inventories, aside from the Best and Home Décor
businesses and recent small acquisitions, are valued at the lower of
Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) cost or market. Other inventories are
generally valued at the lower of First-In, First-Out (FIFO) cost or
market.


Property, Plant and Equipment
(PP&E)

The Company generally values PP&E on the basis
of historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
provided using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. Costs related to maintainance and repairs which do not
prolong the assets useful lives are expensed as incurred. Impairment
losses are recorded on long-lived assets when indicators of impairment
are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated
by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. The
amount of the impairment loss, if any, is quantified by comparing the
carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash
flows, which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of
the assets. Primarily as a result of plant rationalization, certain
facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations, which
has resulted in impairment losses. The following table summarizes
PP&E impairment charges by segment and the classification of these
charges within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents costs in excess
of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired
businesses. Intangible assets acquired are recorded at cost. Goodwill
and other intangible assets were historically amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. As of January
1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets." Under the provisions of this Statement, goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer
subject to amortization but are tested for impairment annually and at
any time where events suggest impairment may have occurred. The
identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangibles
impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting
units, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about future
cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the goodwill of a
reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
loss is recognized for the amount of that excess. Intangible assets
with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful
lives.

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial
instruments are employed to manage risks including foreign currency and
interest rate exposures and are not used for trading or speculative
purposes. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments, such as
interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency options, and foreign
exchange contracts, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically
either in income or in shareowners' equity as a component of
other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative
financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether
it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. Generally,
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value
hedges are recorded in income along with the changes in the fair values
of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk. Gains and losses on
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are
effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently
reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged item when
it occurs. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of
the net investment in foreign operations are reported in other
comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and
for any portion of a hedge that is ineffective, are reported in income.
In the event the forecasted transaction to which a


cash flow hedge relates is no longer likely,
the amount in other comprehensive income is recognized in earnings and
generally the derivative is terminated.

The net interest paid or
received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense.
Gains resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap
agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest
expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the
terminated swap.

At times the Company manages exposure to
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions
through the use of forward exchange contracts or currency options. The
Company may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge
intercompany loans and enter into purchased foreign currency options to
hedge anticipated transactions as it deems appropriate. Gains and
losses on forward exchange contracts are deferred and recognized as
part of the underlying transactions. Changes in the fair value of
options, representing a basket of foreign currencies to hedge
anticipated cross-currency cash flows, are included in cost of
sales.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when
the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership
have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment
of the finished product but sometimes is upon delivery to customer
facilities.

The Best and Access Technologies businesses sell
security related products and automatic doors which include multiple
elements of products and services.  Revenues from multiple
element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned,
consistent with the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables". Amounts allocated to each element are based
on objectively determined fair value. Revenues from multiple element
arrangements were $223 million in 2003, $111 million in 2002 and $89
million in 2001.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense is
based on reported earnings before income taxes. Deferred income taxes
reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and
liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such
amounts recognized for tax purposes, and are measured by applying
enacted tax rates in effect in years in which the differences are
expected to reverse.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings
per share equals net earnings divided by weighted average shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share include the
impact of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method when
the effect is dilutive.

Shipping and Handling Costs

It
is the general practice of the Company to not bill customers for
freight. Shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight
are included in cost of sales. Shipping costs associated with outbound
freight are included as a reduction in net sales and amounted to $114
million, $103 million and $119 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The Company records distribution costs in selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expenses that amounted to $80
million, $68 million and $71 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143
"Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting
and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible, long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is
incurred by capitalizing it as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 in fiscal 2003 had no
impact on the Company.


In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146
"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities." This statement requires costs associated with
exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred and
applies prospectively to such activities that are initiated in fiscal
2003 and beyond. The Company adopted SFAS No. 146 for 2003. This
standard impacted the timing of recognition of costs associated with
exit and disposal activities which are discussed in Note O
Restructuring, Asset Impairments & Other Charges.

In
November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 45
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others" was issued. This Interpretation expands the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual
financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees
that it has issued. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements as
required by the Interpretation as of December 28, 2002. The
Interpretation also requires that a liability for fair value of the
obligation be recorded at the inception of a guarantee, for all
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of
this accounting in fiscal 2003 had no significant impact on the
Company.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46
"Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities." This Interpretation addresses consolidation of
variable interest entities which have equity investment at risk
insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties or
entities with equity investors lacking certain essential
characteristics of controlling financial interest. The original
implementation date in 2003 for this Interpretation was postponed by
action of the FASB and was finally amended in December 2003. Generally,
the implementation of this interpretation by the Company is required
for the Company's quarter ending April 3, 2004. The adoption of
FIN 46 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.

On May 15, 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150
"Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This
Statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as
liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of
the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
This Statement was required to be applied immediately to instruments
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and to all other
instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim
financial reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company
had $213 million notional value Stanley common stock forward contracts
(equity hedges) which were implemented in previous years in an effort
to offset the diluted share count from changes in the stock price. When
the stock price rose, the Company would benefit from the hedge by
partially offsetting the impact of the diluted share count from
in-the-money stock options. These hedges, however, had an opposite
result with a declining stock price. As a risk mitigation initiative
and in conjunction with the new accounting rules under SFAS No. 150,
the Company restructured the $213 million equity hedge contracts. On
April 14, 2003, $100 million of stock was purchased from the equity
hedge counterparties which decreased shares then outstanding by 3.9
million. These transactions were completed using a combination of
borrowings under existing lines of credit and available cash. No open
market purchase of shares occurred. The remaining $113 million in
forward contracts were modified to full physical settlement contracts
with a fixed notional principal of $113 million and 4.1 million of
underlying shares. These contracts are being settled over four years in
equal quarterly installments and do not contain the same dilution
protection (or risk) as the former contracts. The Company has the right
to repurchase all or part of these shares at a cost of $27.73 per share
at any time during the four year period, plus the interest carried on
the debt for the dividends paid on the shares. As a result of adopting
SFAS No. 150, the notional principal balance, $99 million as of January
3, 2004, is recognized as a liability on the balance sheet and the 3.6
million underlying shares are reflected as treasury stock and excluded
from the amount of shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings
per share.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts
for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method
under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees".
Accordingly, no compensation cost is recognized for stock-based
compensation unless the quoted


market price of the stock at the grant date
is in excess of the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock.
Stock-based employee compensation is discussed further in Note K
Capital Stock.

If compensation cost for the Company's
stock-based compensation plans had been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation", the Company's net earnings and
earnings per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts
indicated below:

Pro
forma compensation cost relating to the stock options is recognized
over the vesting period. The vesting periods used for 2003, 2002 and
2001 stock option grants are 2.9 years, 3.9 years and 3.6 years,
respectively. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively: dividend yield of 3.6%, 3.2%
and 2.6%; expected volatility of 25%, 30%, and
40%; risk-free interest rates of 3.3%, 3.2% and
4.8%; and expected lives of 5 years in 2003 and 2002, and 7
years in 2001. The weighted average fair value of stock options granted
in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $5.17, $7.30 and $14.31, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan compensation cost is recognized in the
fourth quarter when the purchase price for the following fiscal year is
established. The fair value of the employees' purchase rights
under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was estimated using the
following assumptions for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively: dividend
yield of 3.9%, 3.3% and 3.0%; expected volatility
of 25%, 30%, and 40%; risk-free interest rates of
1.2%, 1.9% and 2.0%; and expected lives of one
year. The weighted average fair value of those purchase rights granted
in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $6.35, $7.50 and $8.48, respectively.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years' amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In
addition the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operation have
been reclassified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
and the earnings from discontinued operations have been reclassified
within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

In January
2002, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor
Income Statement Characterization of Consideration to a Purchaser of
the Vendor's Products or Services." EITF No. 00-25
requires the reclassification of certain customer promotional payments
previously reported in SG&A expenses as a reduction of revenue, and
prior periods must be restated for comparability of results. Net sales
and SG&A expenses are $14.2 million lower for fiscal year 2001 than
previously published amounts, reflecting reclassification of certain
cooperative advertising expenses.


B.    ACQUISITIONS

On November
25, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of Best Lock
Corporation (Best) for $316.0 million. Best is a global provider of
security access control systems. In 2003, the Company made a $0.6
million additional purchase price payment for Best which was accounted
for as an increase to goodwill.

The Company finalized its
allocation of the purchase price for Best in 2003 to reflect the final
determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and
related deferred tax liabilities. The final allocation of the purchase
price was to the following major balance sheet
categories:

If the
results of operations of Best were included for the entire 2002 and
2001 fiscal years, net sales would have been $220.1 million and $243.3
million higher than the results reported in the 2002 and 2001
Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. Net income and
earnings per share during these periods would not have been
significantly different; however, Best operating results during these
periods are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

In addition to the Best acquisition, the Company acquired three
small businesses at a total cost of $23.4 million in 2003 and five
small businesses at a total cost of $42.7 million in 2002. Purchase
accounting for certain 2003 acquisitions is preliminary, primarily with
respect to identification and valuation of intangibles, and is expected
to be finalized by mid 2004.

The aforementioned acquisitions
were accounted for as purchase transactions and, accordingly, the
operating results have been included in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition. The
acquisitions did not have a material impact on 2003 and 2002
operations.

Included in the acquired liabilities of Best are
$6.4 million in restructuring reserves which were established in
purchase accounting for the planned closure of several Best offices and
synergies in certain centralized functions. The $6.4 million was
comprised of $5.3 million for severance and $1.1 million of other exit
costs primarily related to non-cancelable leases. The Company began
formulating the restructuring plans during the pre-acquisition due
diligence work and these plans include activities initiated by Best
management prior to the acquisition. As of January 3, 2004, all but
$0.7 million of the reserves were expended.

C.    ACCOUNTS
AND NOTES RECEIVABLE


Trade receivables are dispersed among a
large number of retailers, distributors and industrial accounts in many
countries. Adequate provisions have been established to cover
anticipated credit losses.

The Company has agreements to sell,
on a revolving basis, undivided interests in defined pools of notes
receivable to a Qualified Special Purpose Entity (QSPE). The entity is
designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade accounts
receivable and is used as an additional source of liquidity. At January
3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, the defined pools of receivables
amounted to $124.4 million and $133.6 million, respectively. The
proceeds from sales of such eligible receivables, to the QSPE, in
revolving-period securitizations were $21.0 million in 2003 and $11.0
million in 2002, and these amounts have been deducted from receivables
in the January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 Consolidated Balance
Sheets. There were no gains or losses on these sales. The Company is
responsible for servicing and collecting the receivables sold and held
in the QSPE. Any incremental additional costs related to such servicing
and collection efforts are not significant.

In 2003, the Company
acquired a third party's interest in a second Special Purpose
Entity (SPE) which supports the Mac Tools extended financing programs.
As a result, the entity became non-qualifying and the net assets, which
consist of notes receivable of $56.4 million at January 3, 2004, have
been consolidated in the Company's balance sheet. Cash flows
between the Company and the SPE for 2003 totaled $21.0 million,
primarily related to receivable sales, collections on receivables and
servicing fees. During 2003, the Company sold a portion of this
portfolio to a third party for approximately $40 million and recognized
a loss on the sale of approximately $6 million. As of December 28,
2002, this QSPE had $104.5 million of gross receivables and the Company
had $32.4 million in receivables due from the QSPE. There were no gains
or losses on the sale of receivables to the QSPE.

D.    INVENTORIES

Inventories
in the amount of $251.4 million at January 3, 2004 and $304.8 million
at December 28, 2002 were valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market.
If the LIFO method had not been used, inventories would have been $46.9
million higher than reported at January 3, 2004, and $46.1 million
higher than reported at December 28, 2002. The LIFO method is utilized
in determining inventory value as it results in a better matching of
cost and revenues.

E.    ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

At
January 3, 2004, the Company has four properties, valued at $4.9
million, classified as held for sale related to plant rationalization
activities. These assets are all reported within the Tools segment and
consist of real property which is expected to be disposed of throughout
the next year. At December 28, 2002, the Company had five properties
held for sale with a book value of $5.2 million. Two of the properties
held for sale at December 28, 2002 were sold during 2003, and three
continue to be held for sale. In addition to the aforementioned real
properties, the net assets of the entry door business are classified as
held for sale as detailed in Note U Discontinued Operations. Assets
held for sale are carried at the lower of fair value or historical book
value.


F.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND
EQUIPMENT

G.    GOODWILL
AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL In January 2002, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets", which changed the accounting for
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life whereby such
assets are no longer amortized. For these assets, SFAS No. 142 requires
an initial evaluation for impairment upon adoption and annual
evaluations thereafter. The Company performed the initial evaluation
upon adoption and the subsequent evaluations were performed in the
third quarters of 2003 and 2002; none of the evaluations resulted in an
impairment loss. The table below shows comparative pro-forma financial
information as if goodwill had not been amortized for all periods
presented (in millions, except per share
amounts).

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as
follows:


The principal increase in goodwill during
2003 resulted from the completion of the purchase accounting for the
Best acquisition and related allocation of fair value to assets and
liabilities acquired along with the associated deferred taxes on
intangibles. Purchase accounting for certain 2003 acquisitions is
preliminary, primarily with respect to identification and valuation of
intangibles, and is expected to be finalized by mid 2004, and as a
result, goodwill may be adjusted.

Other Intangible
Assets

Other intangible assets, at January 3, 2004 and December
28, 2002 were as follows:

Aggregate
other intangibles amortization expense was $14.0 million, $3.7 million
and $2.7 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Estimated
amortization expense is $13.1 million for 2004, $12.8 million for 2005,
$12.0 million for 2006, $11.3 million for 2007 and $9.5 million for
2008.

During 2003, the Company acquired certain businesses as
discussed in Note B. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company
recorded intangible assets. The purchase accounting, including amounts
attributable to the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, is
preliminary. When the purchase accounting is finalized, these amounts
may be adjusted. The major intangible asset classes associated with
these acquisitions have the following balances at January 3, 2004:


H.    ACCRUED EXPENSES

Accrued
expenses at January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 follow:

I.    LONG-TERM
DEBT AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Long-term debt and financing
arrangements at January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 follow (millions
of dollars):

The
Company has unused committed short-term and long-term credit
arrangements with several U.S. banks to borrow up to $350.0 million at
the lower of prime or money market rates. Of this amount, $100.0
million is long-term. At the Company's option, the $250 million
short term credit lines may be automatically extended to a maturity of
October 2005. Commitment fees range from 0.06% to 0.08%.
In addition, the Company has short-term lines of credit with numerous
foreign banks aggregating $67.0 million, of which the entire amount was
available at January 3, 2004. Short-term arrangements are reviewed
annually for renewal. Of the aggregate $417 million long-term and
short-term lines, $350.0 million is available to support the
Company's commercial paper program. The weighted average interest
rates on short-term borrowings at January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002
were 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively.

To manage
interest costs and foreign exchange risk, the Company maintains a
portfolio of interest rate swap agreements. See Note J Financial
Instruments for more information regarding the Company's interest
rate and currency swap agreements.

Aggregate annual maturities
of long-term debt for each of the years from 2005 to 2008 are $34.5
million, $29.3 million, $240.2 million and $4.8 million, respectively.
Interest paid during 2003, 2002 and 2001 amounted to $32.9 million,
$25.6 million and $33.4 million, respectively.


Included in short-term borrowings on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 28, 2002, are commercial
paper and Extendible Commercial Notes utilized to support working
capital requirements, of $129.0 million.

On November 1, 2002,
the Company issued 5-year and 10-year notes payable of $150.0 million
and $200.0 million, respectively. The proceeds from these notes were
used to acquire Best Lock Corporation and for general corporate
purposes.

In June 2003, $113.0 million in Stanley common stock
equity hedge forward contracts were modified to full physical
settlement contracts with a fixed notional principal of $113.0 million
and 4.1 million of underlying shares. These contracts are being settled
with required cash payments over four years in equal quarterly
installments. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 150, the remaining
notional principal balance of $98.9 million as of January 3, 2004, is
recognized as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the 3.6
million underlying shares are excluded from the amount of shares used
to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share. The $98.9 million
liability represents the amount that would be paid if settlement were
to occur as of January 3, 2004. Changes in the value of the shares of
Stanley common stock have no effect on any future settlement
amounts.

J.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
Company's objectives in using debt related financial instruments
are to obtain the lowest cost source of funds within an acceptable
range of variable to fixed-rate debt proportions and to minimize the
foreign exchange risk of obligations. To meet these objectives the
Company enters into interest rate swap and currency swap
agreements.

The Company uses purchased currency options and
forward exchange contracts to reduce exchange risks arising from
cross-border cash flows expected to occur over the next one year
period. In addition, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts
to hedge inter-company loans and royalty payments. The objective of
these practices is to minimize the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on operating results. At January 3, 2004 and December 28,
2002, the Company had forward contracts hedging inter-company loans
totaling $11.2 million and $12.7 million, respectively and they are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. At January 3, 2004 and December 28,
2002, currency options hedged anticipated transactions totaling $118.0
million and $128.1 million, respectively. The forward contracts and
options are denominated in Canadian dollars, Australian dollars,
Taiwanese dollars, Japanese Yen, Thailand Baht, Great Britain Pound,
Israeli Shekels, Polish Zloty and Euro and generally mature within the
next one year period. The gains and losses recorded on these
transactions are not material to the Company's Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Company entered into two interest rate
swap arrangements in March, 2003. These interest rate swaps are fixed
to floating rate arrangements with the floating rate based on the 3
month LIBOR rate. These swaps are fair value hedges for a portion of
the $150 million five year and $200 million ten year notes issued in
November of 2002. The notional values of the hedges are $75 million and
$100 million with termination dates of November 2007 and November 2012
respectively. There were no gains or losses recorded on these
swaps.

The Company entered into two additional interest rate
swap arrangements in June and October 2003 with notional values of $60
million each. These interest rate swaps are floating to fixed rate
arrangements with a forward start date of March 1, 2004. These swaps
were terminated in November 2003 pursuant to the Company's
decision not to refinance the $120 million of debt maturing in March
2004. The gain associated with the swap termination totaled $2.8
million and is recorded in Other-net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The $120 million of debt has been classified as current in
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In addition, the
Company entered into currency options denominated in the Great Britain
Pound in order to mitigate the currency exposure related to the
proposed transaction of Blick plc, as further discussed in Note V,
Subsequent Events. These options have a notional value of 48.3 million
Great Britain Pounds representing approximately half the purchase price
of Blick plc and expired on January 28, 2004. The fair value of this
option was $1.5 million on January 3, 2004 and is reflected as


a gain in Other-net in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The Company will record an additional $0.4
million gain on the termination of this option in 2004.

The
counterparties to these interest rate and currency financial
instruments are major international financial institutions. The Company
is exposed to credit risk for net exchanges under these agreements, but
not for the notional amounts. The Company considers the risk of default
to be remote.

The carrying values and fair values of the
Company's financial instruments at January 3, 2004 and December
28, 2002 follow:

Generally,
the carrying value of the debt related financial instruments is
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in long-term debt. The fair
values of long-term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow
analysis, based on the Company's marginal borrowing rates. The
fair values of foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements are
based on current settlement values. The carrying amount of cash
equivalents and short-term borrowings approximates fair value.

and 2001 was as follows:

Common
Stock Equity Hedge

The Company previously entered into equity
hedges, in the form of equity forwards on Stanley common shares, to
offset the dilutive effect of in-the-money stock options on earnings
per share and to reduce potential cash outflow for the repurchase of
the Company's stock to offset stock option


exercises. Under the equity hedge contracts,
when the price of Stanley stock appreciated since the last quarterly
interim settlement, the Company received Stanley common shares from the
counterparties. When the price of Stanley stock depreciated since the
last quarterly interim settlement, the Company delivered Stanley common
stock from treasury shares to the counterparties. Interim quarterly
settlements were in shares of common stock, not cash, and were
accounted for within equity. As of December 28, 2002, the equity hedge
contracts had a $213 million notional value with 6.1 million underlying
shares. In April 2003, the Company settled $100 million of the
contracts through a cash repurchase of 3.9 million underlying shares at
that time. In June 2003, the remaining $113 million in Stanley common
stock equity hedge forward contracts were modified to full physical
settlement contracts with a fixed notional principal of $113 million
and 4.1 million of underlying shares as discussed in Note I Long-term
Debt and Financing Arrangements.

Exclusive of final settlement
activity in 2003, aggregate annual settlement activity under the equity
hedge was as follows: 1,896,482 shares of common stock with a market
value of $47.2 million ($66.0 million book value) delivered in 2003,
1,338,708 shares of common stock with a market value of $46.6 million
($41.6 million book value) delivered in 2002 and 1,432,264 shares of
common stock with a market and book value of $67.0 million received in
2001. This annual settlement activity is reflected as issued from
treasury in the table of common stock share activity above.

Common Stock Reserved

Common stock shares reserved for
issuance under various employee and director stock plans at January 3,
2004 and December 28, 2002 follows:

Preferred
Stock Purchase Rights

Each outstanding share of common stock has
one half of a share purchase right. Each purchase right may be
exercised to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $220.00, subject
to adjustment. The rights, which do not have voting rights, expire on
March 10, 2006, and may be redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.01
per right at any time prior to the tenth day following the public
announcement that a person has acquired beneficial ownership of
10% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.

In
the event that the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
combination transaction, provision shall be made so that each holder of
a right (other than a holder who is a 10%-or-more shareowner)
shall have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof, that number of
shares of common stock of the surviving Company having a market value
equal to two times the exercise price of the right. Similarly, if
anyone becomes the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the then
outstanding shares of common stock (except pursuant to an offer for all
outstanding shares of common stock which the independent directors have
deemed to be fair and in the best interest of the Company), provision
will be made so that each holder of a right (other than a holder who is
a 10%-or-more shareowner) shall thereafter have the right to
receive, upon exercise thereof, common stock (or, in certain
circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company)
having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the
right. At January 3, 2004 there were 40,638,411 outstanding rights.
There are 250,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock reserved for issuance in connection with the rights.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has stock-based
compensation plans for salaried employees and non-employee directors of
the Company and its affiliates. The plans provide for discretionary
grants of stock options, restricted stock shares and other stock-based
awards. Stock options are granted at the market price of


the Company's stock on the date of
grant and have a ten-year term. Generally, stock option grants vest
ratably between one and five years from the date of grant.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan enables
substantially all employees in the United States, Canada and Belgium to
subscribe at any time to purchase shares of common stock on a monthly
basis at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the shares
on the first day of the plan year ($25.41 per share for fiscal year
2003 purchases) or 85% of the fair market value of the shares on
the last business day of each month. A maximum of 6,000,000 shares are
authorized for subscription. During 2003, 2002 and 2001 shares totaling
49,743, 119,853, and 273,784, respectively, were issued under the plan
at average prices of $23.41, $31.42 and $17.32 per share,
respectively.

Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan

The
Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (LTSIP) provides for the granting of
awards to senior management employees for achieving Company performance
measures. The Plan is administered by the Compensation and Organization
Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of non-employee
directors. Awards are generally payable in shares of common stock as
directed by the Committee. Shares totaling 45,231, 19,949 and 15,900
were earned in 2003, 2002 and, 2001, respectively. LTSIP expense was
$1.1 million in 2003, $0.5 million in 2002 and $0.5 million in
2001.


L.    ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE
LOSS

Accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of each
fiscal year was as follows:

M.    EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS

Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP)

Substantially all U.S. employees may contribute from
1% to 15% of their salary to a tax deferred savings plan.
Employees elect where to invest their own contributions. The Company
contributes an amount equal to one-half of the employee contribution up
to the first 7% of their salary, all of which is invested in the
Company's common stock. The amounts in 2003, 2002 and 2001 under
this matching arrangement were $5.3 million, $5.7 million and $5.8
million, respectively.

The Company also provides a
non-contributory benefit for U.S. salaried and non-union hourly
employees, called the Cornerstone plan. Under this benefit arrangement,
the Company contributes amounts ranging from 3% to 9% of
employee compensation based on age. Approximately 2,000 U.S. employees
receive an additional average 1.5% contribution actuarially
designed to replace the pension benefits curtailed in 2001.
Contributions under the Cornerstone plan were $13.9 million in 2003,
$12.8 million in 2002 and $12.7 million in 2001. Assets of the
Cornerstone defined contribution plan are invested in equity securities
and bonds.

Shares of the Company's common stock held by
the ESOP were purchased with the proceeds of external borrowings in the
1980's and borrowings from the Company in 1991. The external ESOP
borrowings are guaranteed by the Company and are included in long-term
debt. Shareowners' equity reflects a reduction for the internal
and external borrowings.

Unallocated shares are released from
the trust based on current period debt principal and interest payments
as a percentage of total future debt principal and interest payments.
These released shares along with allocated dividends, dividends on
unallocated shares acquired with the 1991 loan, and shares purchased on
the open market are used to fund employee contributions, employer
contributions and dividends earned on participant account balances.
Dividends on unallocated shares acquired with the 1989 and prior loan
are used only for debt service.

Net ESOP activity recognized is
based on total debt service and share purchase requirements less
employee contributions and dividends on ESOP shares. The
Company's net ESOP activity resulted in expense of $9.2 million
in 2003, $0.1 million in 2002, and $0.1 million in 2001. ESOP expense
is affected by the market value of Stanley common stock on the monthly
dates when shares are released. In 2003, the market value of shares
released averaged $29.30 per share. ESOP expense may vary in the future
in the event the market value of the shares increase or decrease.

Dividends on ESOP shares, which are charged to shareowners'
equity as declared, were $12.4 million in 2003, $12.6 million in 2002
and $13.6 million in 2001. Interest costs incurred by the ESOP on
external debt for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $0.9 million, $1.2 million
and $1.5 million, respectively. Both allocated and unallocated ESOP
shares are treated as outstanding for purposes of computing earnings
per share. As of January  3, 2004, the number of ESOP shares
allocated to participant accounts was 5,137,215 and the number of
unallocated shares was 6,711,139. The fair value of the unallocated
ESOP shares at January 3, 2004 was $248.6 million.


Pension and Other Benefit
Plans

The Company sponsors pension plans covering most domestic
hourly and executive employees, and approximately 2,200 foreign
employees. Benefits are generally based on salary and years of service,
except for collective bargaining employees whose benefits are based on
a stated amount for each year of service.

In 2001, the Company
curtailed the U.S. salaried and non-union hourly plan with respect to
eliminating the impact from future salary increases on benefits,
resulting in a pre-tax curtailment gain of $29.3 million. The Company
recorded an $18.4 million pre-tax gain associated with final settlement
of these pension obligations in June 2002, which reflects a reduction
for excise taxes and other expenses from the $37.2 million actuarially
determined settlement gain reported in the pension expense table
below.

The Company contributes to multi-employer plans for
certain collective bargaining U.S. employees. In addition, various
other defined contribution plans are sponsored worldwide.

The components of net periodic pension cost
are as follows:

The Company provides
medical and dental benefits for certain retired employees in the United
States. In addition, U.S. employees who retire from active service are
eligible for life insurance benefits. Net periodic postretirement
benefit expense was $2.0 million in 2003, $1.5 million in 2002 and $1.8
million in 2001.


The Company generally uses a November 30
measurement date for its pension plans with plan assets and a December
31 measurement date for other plans. The changes in the pension and
other postretirement benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets as
well as amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are
shown below:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans
was $212.0 million at January  3, 2004 and $171.7 million at
December 28, 2002.


Information regarding pension plans in
which accumulated benefit obligations exceed plan assets:

Information regarding pension plans in which
projected benefit obligations (inclusive of anticipated future
compensation increases) exceed plan assets:

The major assumptions used in valuing
pension and post-retirement plan obligations and net cost were as
follows:

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined
considering the returns projected for the various asset classes and the
relative weighting for each asset class as reflected in the target
asset allocation below. In addition the Company considers historical
performance and the opinions of outside actuaries and other
professionals in developing benchmark returns.

Pension Plan
Assets

Plan assets are invested in equity securities, bonds and
other fixed income securities, real estate, money market instruments
and insurance contracts. The Company's weighted-average worldwide
actual asset allocations at January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 by
asset category are as follows:

The
Company's investment strategy for pension plan assets includes
diversification to minimize interest and market risks, and generally
does not involve the use of derivative financial instruments.


Plan assets are rebalanced periodically to
maintain target asset allocations. Maturities of investments are not
necessarily related to the timing of expected future benefit payments,
but adequate liquidity to make immediate and medium term benefit
payments is ensured.

Contributions

The Company's
funding policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts
determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and
future benefits in accordance with federal law and other regulations.
The Company expects to contribute approximately $10 million to its
pension plans and $3 million to its other postretirement benefit plan
in 2004.

Health Care Cost Trends and Medicare Prescription Act
of 2003 Impact

The weighted average annual assumed rate of
increase in the per-capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care
cost trend rate) is assumed to be 11.0% for 2003, reducing
gradually to 5.5% by 2013 and remaining at that level
thereafter. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care
cost trend rate would have the following effects as of January 3,
2004:

In December 2003, the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the
"Act") was signed into law. The Act
introduced a plan sponsor subsidy based on a percentage of a
beneficiary's annual prescription drug benefits, within defined
limits, and the opportuity for a retiree to obtain presciption drug
benefits under Medicare.

Certain employees are covered under
legacy benefit provisions that include prescription drug coverage for
Medicare-eligible retirees. In order to coordinate this coverage with
the Act, the Company plans to complete a strategic review of its
postretirement plans during the two year transitional period provided
in the Act. In accordance with FASB Staff Position FAS 106-1, the
benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost do not reflect any
potential effects of the Act. Since the Company has already taken steps
to limit its postretirement medical benefits, any reductions in
postretirement benefit costs resulting from the Act are not expected to
be material.

N.    OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES

Other-net
is primarily comprised of intangibles amortization expense, gains and
losses on asset dispostions, currency impact, environmental expense,
results from unconsolidated entities, and net expenses related to the
Mac Tools extended financing programs, primarily financing receivable
losses and interest income. Other-net in 2003 includes $9.5 million in
charges related to the exit of the Mac Tools retail channel. Other-net
in 2002 includes a nonrecurring pension settlement gain of $18.4
million and $11.3 million in income from an environmental settlement
with an insurance carrier. There was no goodwill amortization expense
in 2003 and 2002, due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, while goodwill
amortization expense was $7.6 million in 2001. Other-net in 2001
includes a nonrecurring pension curtailment gain of $29.3 million.

Advertising costs, classified in SG&A expenses, are expensed as
incurred and amounted to $24.1 million in 2003, $21.6 million in 2002
and $23.8 million in 2001. Cooperative advertising expense reported as
a deduction in Net sales was $23.3 million in 2003, $18.7 million in
2002 and $14.6 million in 2001.

Research and development costs
were $10.1 million, $8.7 million and $11.8 million for the fiscal years
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

O.    RESTRUCTURING, ASSET
IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER CHARGES

The Company announced
restructuring plans ("Operation 15") in April
2003 to improve the profitability of certain businesses. The
restructuring was completed in 2003 and included a workforce


reduction of over 1,000 people, the exit
from the Mac Tools retail channel
("MacDirect"), and the impairment of certain
fixed assets and inventories related to the future consolidation of two
distribution facilities. In 2003, the Company recorded $50.1 million
restructuring and asset impairment charges for the Operation 15
initiative. These charges consisted of $12.5 million for severance,
$27.0 million of asset impairments and $10.6 million of other exit
costs related to the exit from the Company's MacDirect retail
channel. The asset impairments generally relate to assets which are
idle mainly as a result of the restructuring initiatives and
accordingly their book value has been written off. The Company also
recorded $66.3 million charges for other exit costs and CEO retirement
costs. These charges include $12.6 million in Cost of sales for the
planned closure of a U.S. distribution facility, $7.6 million in
SG&A for compensation and benefit costs associated with the
CEO's retirement, $3.5 million in other SG&A charges, and
$42.6 million in costs related to the Company's exit from the
MacDirect retail channel. The Company anticipates utilizing the
remaining reserves by the end of 2004.

In the first quarter of
2003, the Company recorded $3.1 million in restructuring reserves for
new initiatives, mainly in the Tools segment, pertaining to the further
reduction of its cost structure, primarily for severance-related
obligations.

In 2001, the Company undertook initiatives to
reduce its cost structure and executed several business repositionings
intended to improve its competitiveness. These actions resulted in the
closure of 13 facilities and a net employment reduction of
approximately 2,200 production, selling and administrative people. As a
result, the Company recorded $72.4 million of restructuring and asset
impairment charges. The charges for asset impairments were primarily
related to manufacturing and other assets that were retired and
disposed of as a result of manufacturing facility closures.

In
June 2002 and September 2001, $8.4 million and $4.8 million in
severance charges were recorded, respectively, as the Company continued
to rationalize its headcount to provide further SG&A expense
reductions. These charges were classified within SG&A expense in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These actions resulted in
the termination of approximately 200 selling and administrative
employees in each year. As of December 28, 2002, no accrual remained as
all of the severance has been expended.

At January 3, 2004, the
restructuring and asset impairment reserve balance was $16.1 million,
which the Company expects to be fully expended by the end of third
quarter 2004. A summary of the Company's restructuring reserves
for the years ended December 28, 2002 to January 3, 2004 is as follows
(millions of dollars):

As
of January 3, 2004, 86 manufacturing and distribution facilities have
been closed as a result of the restructuring initiatives since 1997. In
2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 1,100, 1,000 and 2,100 employees had
been terminated as a result of restructuring initiatives, respectively.
Severance payments of $17.9 million, $26.0 million and $41.7 million
and other exit payments of $9.6 million, $4.4 million and $3.4 million
were made in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Write-offs of impaired
assets were $18.3 million, $5.8 million and $7.9 million in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively.


P.    BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC
AREA

The Company operates worldwide in two reportable business
segments: Tools and Doors. The Tools segment includes carpenters,
mechanics, pneumatic and hydraulic tools as well as tool sets. The
Doors segment includes automatic doors, as well as closet doors and
systems, home decor, door locking systems, commercial and consumer
hardware, security access control systems and patient monitoring
devices. The information below excludes the residential entry door
business, which is classified as discontinued operations as disclosed
in Note U Discontinued Operations, unless otherwise noted.

The Company
assesses the performance of its reportable business segments using
operating profit, which follows the same accounting policies as those
described in Note A Significant Accounting Policies. Operating profit
excludes interest income, interest expense, other-net, and income tax
expense. In addition, operating profit excludes restructuring charges
and asset impairments. Corporate and shared expenses are allocated to
each segment. Sales between segments are not material. Segment assets
primarily include accounts receivable, inventory, other current assets,
property, plant and


equipment, intangible assets and other
miscellaneous assets. Corporate assets and unallocated assets are cash,
deferred income taxes and certain other assets. Geographic net sales
and long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic regions based on
the geographic location of each Stanley subsidiary.

Sales to The
Home Depot were approximately 15%, 15% and 14% of
consolidated net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, excluding
the entry door business which is classified as a discontinued operation
as discussed in Note U Discontinued Operations. Inclusive of the entry
door business discontinued operation, sales to The Home Depot
represented 19%, 21%, and 20% of consolidated net
sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For 2003, 2002 and 2001 net
sales to this one customer amounted to 19%, 29% and
26% of segment net sales, respectively, for the Doors segment
and 13%, 13% and 12%, respectively for the Tools
segment.


Q.    INCOME TAXES

Significant
components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities
as of the end of each fiscal year are as follows:

Valuation
allowances reduced the deferred tax asset attributable to foreign and
state loss carryforwards to the amount that, based upon all available
evidence, is more likely than not to be realized. Reversal of the
valuation allowance is contingent upon the recognition of future
taxable income and capital gains in specific foreign countries and
specific states, or changes in circumstances which cause the
recognition of the benefits to become more likely than not. The foreign
and state loss carryforwards expire in various years beginning in 2004.
The overall change in net deferred taxes is primarily attributable to
the non-deductibility of amortization associated with the acquisition
of Best.

The classification of deferred taxes as of January 3,
2004 and December 28, 2002 is as follows:


Income tax expense (benefit)
attributable to continuing operations consisted of the following:

Income
taxes paid during 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $11.2 million, (net of a
$22.1 million U.S. Federal refund), $120.0 million and $41.4 million,
respectively. During 2003, the Company had tax holidays with Thailand
and China. Tax holidays resulted in a $2.5 million reduction in tax
expense in 2003, $2.2 million in 2002, and $4.2 million in 2001. The
tax holiday in China is in place through 2004 and the tax holiday in
Thailand is in place until 2010.

The reconciliation of federal
income tax at the statutory federal rate to income tax at the effective
rate for continuing operations is as follows:

The
components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes
consisted of the following:

The
Company's future effective tax rates could be adversely affected
by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where the
statutory rates are lower. The Company is subject to the examinations
of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. The Company evaluates the likelihood of unfavorable
adjustments arising from the examinations and believes adequate
provisions have been made in the income tax provision. Undistributed
foreign earnings of $214.1 million at January 3, 2004 are considered to
be invested indefinitely or will be


remitted substantially free of additional
tax. Accordingly, no provision has been made for taxes that might be
payable upon remittance of such earnings, nor is it practicable to
determine the amount of this liability.

R.    COMMITMENTS

The Company has noncancelable operating
lease agreements, principally related to facilities, vehicles,
machinery and equipment. Minimum payments have not been reduced by
minimum sublease rentals of $8.4 million due in the future under
noncancelable subleases. In addition, the Company is a party to
synthetic leasing programs which qualify as operating leases, for two
of its major distribution centers. Rental expense, net of sublease
income, for operating leases was $45.2 million in 2003, $36.4 million
in 2002 and $36.8 million in 2001.

The Company has $34.3 million
in commitments for outsourcing arrangements, primarily related to
information systems and telecommunications and $20.7 million of cash
funding commitments pertaining to the Company's U.S. Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Included in material purchases is $2.7
million related to the entry door business, classified as a
discontinued operation as disclosed in Note U Discontinued Operations,
which will be assumed by the buyer, Masonite.

The following
table includes the future commitments due for lease obligations,
materal purchases and outsourcing arrangements.

The Company has numerous assets,
predominantly vehicles and equipment, under a one-year term renewable
U.S. master personal property lease. Residual value obligations, which
approximate the fair value of the related assets, under this master
lease were $35.0 million at January 3, 2004. The U.S. master personal
property lease obligations are not reflected in the future minimum
lease payments since the initial and remaining term does not exceed one
year. The Company routinely exercises various lease renewal options and
from time to time purchases leased assets for fair value at the end of
lease terms.

The Company is party to synthetic leasing programs
for two of its major distribution centers. The programs qualify as
operating leases for accounting purposes, where only the monthly lease
amount is recorded in the income statement and the liability and value
of underlying assets are off-balance sheet. As of January 3, 2004, the
estimated fair values of assets and remaining obligations for these two
properties were $37 million and $28 million, respectively.


S.    GUARANTEES

The Company has sold various businesses and
properties over many years and provided standard indemnification to the
purchasers with respect to any unknown liabilities, such as
environmental, which may arise in the future that are attributable to
the time of Stanley's ownership. The Company has not accrued any
liabilities associated with these general indemnifications since there
are no identified exposures.

The Company provides product and
service warranties which vary across its businesses. The types of
warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime,
while certain products carry no warranty. Further, the Company incurs
discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product
performance issues. Historical warranty and service claim experience
forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized. Adjustments are
recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes
available.

The changes in the carrying amount of product and
service warranties for the year ended January 3, 2004 and December 28,
2002 are as follows:

T.    CONTINGENCIES

The Company is
involved in various legal proceedings relating to environmental issues,
employment, product liability and workers' compensation claims
and other matters. The Company periodically reviews the status of these
proceedings with both inside and outside counsel, as well as an actuary
for risk insurance. Management believes that the ultimate disposition
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on operations
or financial condition taken as a whole.

The Company recognizes
liabilities for contingent exposures when analysis indicates it is both
probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of impairment or loss can reasonably be
estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, the Company
accrues the most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the
range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in
the range is accrued.


In the normal course of business, the
Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims. In addition, the
Company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state
regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation. Also, the
Company, along with many other companies, has been named as a
potentially responsible party (PRP) in a number of administrative
proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites, including ten
active Superfund sites. Current laws potentially impose joint and
several liability upon each PRP. In assessing its potential liability
at these sites, the Company has considered the following: the solvency
of the other PRPs, whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms
of existing agreements, experience at similar sites, and the fact that
the Company's volumetric contribution at these sites is
relatively small.

The Company's policy is to accrue
environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded
is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to
each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology,
presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take
into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties.
As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the
amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As
of January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, the Company had reserves of
$11.5 million and $16.7 million, respectively, primarily for
remediation activities associated with Company-owned properties as well
as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. Of
this amount, $2.8 million is classified as current and $8.7 million as
long-term. The range of environmental remediation costs that is
reasonably possible is $11.5 million to $35.5 million which is subject
to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental
remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded
on those sites in accordance with policy.

The environmental
liability for certain sites that have cash payments that are fixed or
reliably determinable have been discounted using a rate in the range of
2.6% to 5.4%, depending on the timing of cash payments.
The discounted and undiscounted amount of the liability relative to
these sites is $6.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively, as of
January 3, 2004 and $5.5 million and $7.7 million, respectively, as of
December 28, 2002. The payments relative to these sites are expected to
be $2.2 million in 2004, $0.7 million in 2005, $1.0 million in 2006,
$0.3 million in 2007, $0.3 million in 2008 and $3.9 million
thereafter.

The amount recorded for identified contingent
liabilities is based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed
periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred in
future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent
uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject to the
imprecision in estimating future contingent liability costs, the
Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection
with these matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a
materially adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

As previously disclosed in the 2002
Annual Report, the Company's audited Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 28, 2002 include $5.6 million,
or 4¢ per fully diluted share, of accounting corrections related
primarily to expense capitalization and depreciation in fiscal years
1999 through 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2003 the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued a formal order of private investigation in
connection with allegations regarding certain accounting matters. These
allegations, which had previously been raised with the Company
anonymously, were initially researched and evaluated by the
Company's management, internal audit staff and independent
auditors, and subsequently, further investigated by a second
multinational accounting firm, all under the supervision of the audit
committee of the Board of Directors. This resulted in the accounting
corrections referred to above. The Company cooperated fully with the
SEC prior to issuance of the formal order and continues to do so.
Management, the Board of Directors and the Company's independent
auditors concluded that such corrections were immaterial, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, to the December 28, 2002 audited
Consolidated Financial Statements and immaterial to the previously
reported results of the prior years and quarters to which they
relate.


U.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On December 8, 2003, the Company entered into a definitive agreement
to sell its residential entry door business to Masonite International
Corporation. The sale transaction closed on March 2, 2004 and will
result in an after-tax gain of approximately $100 million to be
recognized in 2004. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets", the results of operations of the entry door
business for the current and prior periods have been reported as
discontinued operations. In addition the assets and liabilities of the
business have been reclassified as held for sale in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

The business manufactures and distributes steel
and fiberglass entry doors and components, throughout North America.
Operating results of the entry door business, which were formerly
included in the Doors segment, are summarized as follows:

The entry door business sales
to The Home Depot amounted to 82% of net sales in 2003,
85% in 2002 and 80% in 2001.

Assets and
liabilities of the entry door business as of January 3, 2004 and
December 28, 2002 are as follows:

V.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On January
15, 2004 the Company completed the acquisition of Illinois-based
Chicago Steel Tape Co. and certain related assets and affiliated
companies that are collectively known as CST / Berger. CST / Berger is
a leading designer and manufacturer of laser and optical leveling and
measuring equipment. The Company financed the $62 million cash purchase
with existing cash resources and credit facilities.

The Company
acquired 95% of the common shares of Frisco Bay Industries Ltd.
through a tender offer completed on March 9, 2004, and is now in the
process of acquiring the remaining shares.   Frisco Bay is a
leading Canadian integrator of security solutions, with annual sales of
approximately $40 million.

In 2004, the Company received
more than 99% valid acceptances to its cash offer for the
outstanding shares of Blick plc. The Company expects to complete the
compulsory acquisition of all remaining outstanding Blick plc shares on
or about the end of the first quarter. Blick plc is a leading U.K.
integrator of security systems, communication and time management
solutions to the commercial and industrial sectors with annual sales of
around $120 million. Of the approximately $173 million purchase price,
$151 million was financed with existing cash and credit facilities and
the $22 million balance represents long-term notes payable which
convert to demand notes after December 31, 2004.


In January 2004, the Company obtained a
$150 million line of credit which expires in October 2004. The Company
may elect to use this line of credit to provide liquidity to complete
announced acquisitions or for other purposes.

On December 31,
2003, John M. Trani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, retired.
Effective March 1, 2004, John F. Lundgren was elected Chairman and
CEO.

In the third quarter of 2003, the Company announced that it
had entered into a contract for a $30 million acquisition to be
accompanied by marketing, sourcing and manufacturing cooperation. On
March 1, 2004, the Company determined certain contingencies related to
the transaction will not be resolved. Accordingly, the commitment has
been rescinded.

On March 2, 2004, the Company completed the sale
of its residential entry door business to Masonite International
Corporation for $162 million in cash. The after-tax gain on the
transaction of approximately $100 million will be recognized in the
first quarter of 2004.


**

Changes in previously
reported Net sales, Gross profit and Selling, general and
administrative expenses are due to the reclassification of amounts
related to the discontinued operations of the entry door business. As
described in Note U Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K, the
Company met the requirements to classify its entry door business as a
discontinued operation in December
2003.
