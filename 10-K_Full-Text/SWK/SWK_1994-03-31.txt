          Item 1.   Business

          1(a) General Development of Business.  During 1993, the
      company acquired several businesses for a total of $24.0 million. 
      The most significant of the businesses acquired were Friess & Co.
      KG, a German manufacturer and marketer of paint rollers and
      brushes and Rikkoh-Sha Co. Ltd., a mechanics tools distributor in
      Japan.  On June 30, 1993, the company sold all of the stock of
      Taylor Rental Corporation, franchisor of the nation's largest
      system of general rental centers for do-it-yourselfers and
      commercial customers.

          1(b) Industry Segment Information.  Industry segment
      information on page 15 of Registrant's Annual Report to
      shareholders for the year ended January 1, 1994 is incorporated
      herein by reference.

          1(c) Narrative Description of Business.  Registrant's
      operations can be classified into three industry segments: 
      Tools, Hardware and Specialty Hardware. 

          Tools.  The Tools segment consists of consumer, industrial
      and engineered tools.  Consumer tools includes hand tools such as
      measuring instruments, planes, hammers, knives, wrenches,
      sockets, screwdrivers, saws, chisels, boring tools, masonry, tile
      and drywall tools, paint preparation and paint application tools. 
      Industrial tools includes industrial and mechanics hand tools,
      including STANLEY-PROTO  industrial tools and MAC  mechanics
      tools and high-density industrial storage and retrieval systems. 
      Engineered tools includes air tools, hydraulic tools and STANLEY-
      BOSTITCH  fastening tools and fasteners.

          Hardware.  The hardware segment consists of hardware such as
      hinges, hasps, brackets, bolts, latches, closet hardware and
      organizer systems and other shelving, screen and storm door
      hardware, hardware for sliding, folding and pocket doors,
      residential door hardware, mirrors and mirrored closet doors.  

          Specialty Hardware.  The specialty hardware segment consists
      of residential door systems such as original and replacement
      garage and entry doors, power-operated doors and gates and home
      automation products, including garage door openers, electronic
      controls and other similar products.

          Competition.  The company competes on the basis of its
      manufacturing capabilities, extensive distribution system and
      merchandising service, the breadth of its product lines, its

                                     -1-





      reputation for product quality, its well-known trademarks and its
      electronic data interchange ("EDI") capabilities.  The company
      believes that its significant long-term investments have made it
      an industry leader in the utilization of EDI.

          The company encounters active competition in all of its
      activities from both larger and smaller companies that offer the
      same or similar products and services or that produce different
      products appropriate for the same uses.  In 1993, the company's
      approximately $70 million investment in new equipment and
      advanced business systems resulted in improved manufacturing
      processes and decreased inventories and transaction costs both
      for the company and its customers.

          In the company's consumer hand tool and consumer hardware
      businesses, a small number of competitors produce a range of
      products somewhat comparable to the company's, but the majority
      of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more
      individual products within a particular line.  The company
      believes that it is the largest manufacturer of consumer hand
      tools in the world and that it offers the broadest line of such
      products.  The company believes that its market position in the
      U.S. and Canada for consumer hardware is comparable to or greater
      than that of its major competitors and that it offers the
      broadest line of hinges and home hardware, which represents the
      most important part of its hardware product sales.  

          In the company's industrial hand tool business in the U.S.,
      the company believes that it is a leading manufacturer of high-
      density industrial storage cabinets.  In the company's engineered
      hand tool business in the U.S., the company believes that it is
      the leader in the manufacture and sale of pneumatic fastening
      tools and related fasteners to professional contractors and to
      the furniture and pallet industries as well as the leading
      manufacturer of portable and mounted hydraulic tools.
       
          In the company's non-consumer hardware business in the U.S.,
      the company believes that it is a leading manufacturer of
      residential and architectural hardware products, mirrored closet
      doors and hardware for sliding, folding and pocket doors and
      screen and storm door hardware; and a leading supplier of closet
      rods, supports, brackets and wall mirrors.

          In the company's specialty hardware business, the company
      believes that it is a leader in the U.S. with respect to the
      manufacture and sale of insulated steel residential entry doors, 
      garage door openers and automatic sliding and swinging doors and
      gate openers for commercial and industrial use.
          
          Customers.  A substantial portion of the company's products
      are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution
      channels in the U.S.  A consolidation of retailers in these

                                     -2-





      channels is occurring.  These customers constitute a growing
      percent of the company's sales and are important to the company's
      operating results.  While this consolidation and the geographic
      expansion of these large retailers provide the company with
      opportunities for growth, the increasing size and importance of
      individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to
      potential volume loss.  The loss of certain of the larger home
      centers as customers could have a material adverse effect on each
      of the company's business segments until either such customers
      are replaced or the company makes the necessary adjustments to
      compensate for the loss of business.  The company has addressed
      this issue by strategically focusing on excellence in customer
      service, new product innovations, and distribution channel
      development.

          Raw Materials.  The company's products are manufactured
      primarily of steel and other metals, although some are of wood or
      plastic.  The raw materials required are available from a number
      of sources at competitive prices.  The company does not purchase
      a significant amount of its supplies under long-term contracts, 
      however, it has relationships of long standing with many of its
      suppliers. The company has experienced no difficulties in
      obtaining supplies in recent periods.  

          Backlog.  At February 5, 1994, the company had approximately
      $130 million in unfilled orders compared with $126 million in
      unfilled orders at February 6, 1993.  All these orders are
      reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year.
      Most customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a
      result, the company produces primarily for inventory, rather than
      to fill specific orders.

          Patents and Trademarks.  No segment of Registrant's business
      is dependent, to any significant degree, on patents, licenses,
      franchises or concessions.  The company owns numerous patents,
      none of which are material to the company's operations as a
      whole.  These patents expire from time to time over the next 17
      years.  The company holds licenses, franchises and concessions,
      none of which individually or in the aggregate is material to the
      company's operations as a whole.  These licenses, franchises and
      concessions vary in duration from one to 17 years.

          The company has numerous trademarks that are utilized in its
      businesses worldwide.  The STANLEY  and STANLEY (in a notched
      rectangle)  trademarks are material to all three business
      segments.  These well-known trademarks enjoy a reputation for
      excellence.  In addition, in the Tools segment, the Bostitch ,
      Powerlock , Tape Rule Case Design (Powerlock) , MAC Tools ,
      Proto , and Vidmar  trademarks are material to the business. 

          Environmental Regulations.  The company is subject to various
      environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign

                                     -3-





      countries where it has operations.  Future laws and regulations
      are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely
      increase the company's expenditures related to environmental
      matters.
        
           The company is involved with remedial and other
      environmental compliance activities at some of its current and
      former sites.  Additionally, the company, together with other
      parties, has been named a potentially responsible party ("PRP")
      with respect to nine Superfund sites.  Current laws potentially
      impose joint and several liability upon each PRP.  In assessing
      its potential liability at these sites, the company has
      considered the following: the solvency of the other PRP's,
      whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms of existing
      agreements, experience at similar sites, and the fact that its
      volummetric contribution at these sites is relatively small.
       
           The company's policy is to accrue environmental
      investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it
      is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
      loss can be reasonably estimated.  The amount of liability
      recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts
      with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as
      existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and
      prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites.  The
      amounts recorded do not take into account any claims for
      recoveries from insurance or third parties.  As assessments and
      remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded
      are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
      technical and legal information which becomes available.  As of
      year-end 1993, the company had reserves of $18 million, primarily
      for remediation activities associated with company-owned
      properties as well as for Superfund sites. 

          Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future
      periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent
      uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures.  Subject to
      the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the
      company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in
      connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts
      recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial
      position, results of operations or liquidity.
       
          Power-generating Subsidiary.  Under the General Statutes of
      Connecticut, the company is deemed to be a "holding company" that
      controls an electric company as a result of its being the sole
      shareholder of Farmington River Power Co., a power-generating
      subsidiary of the company since 1916.  Under such statute, no
      organization or person may take any action to acquire control of
      such a holding company without the prior approval of the
      Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control.


                                     -4-





          Employees.  During 1993, the company had an average of 18,988 
      employees, approximately 12,750 of whom were employed in the U.S. 
      Of these U.S. employees, approximately 23% are covered by
      collective bargaining agreements with approximately 12 labor
      unions.  The majority of the company's hourly- and weekly-paid
      employees outside the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining
      agreements.  Approximately 1,200 of the hourly-paid production
      and maintenance employees who are employed by the company's
      operations in New Britain, Connecticut are covered by agreements
      with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
      Workers that expire in May 1994.  The balance of the company's
      labor agreements expire in 1994, 1995 and 1996.  There have been
      no significant interruptions or curtailments of the company's
      operations in recent years due to labor disputes.  The company
      believes that its relationship with its employees is good.

          Item 2. Properties.

          As of January 1, 1994, Registrant and its subsidiaries
      operated facilities for manufacturing and distribution in 22
      states and 21 foreign countries.  The Registrant believes that
      its facilities are suitable and adequate for its business.  The 
      Registrant utilizes approximately 14,126,100 square feet of floor
      space in its business, of which approximately 3,972,067 square
      feet of floor space is leased.

          Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

          3(a) The company is a party to a number of proceedings before
      federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental
      remediation.  Also, the company, along with many other companies,
      has been named as a potentially responsible party in a number of
      administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste
      sites, including nine Superfund sites.  In addition, in the
      normal course of business, the company is involved in various
      lawsuits and claims.  The company does not expect that the
      resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect
      on the company's consolidated financial position or results of
      operations.

          3(b) (i)  On May 22, 1990, a federal grand jury sitting in
      St. Louis, Missouri indicted four manufacturers and five
      individuals, charging each with one count of illegal price fixing
      activities in the sale of architectural hinges.  Architectural
      hinges, which are heavy hinges used for non-residential
      applications, constitute a small portion of the business of one
      division of the company and do not involve a substantial portion

                                     -6-





      of the company's overall business.  

               In addition to the company, the companies indicted were
      The Hager Hinge Company, McKinney Products Company, and Lawrence
      Brothers, Inc.  The individuals named in the indictment were John
      F. Hollfelder (who left the company's employ in 1988), Robert A.
      Haversat and David B. Gibson of McKinney Products Company, and
      John A. Lawrence of Lawrence Brothers, Inc.  Richard G. Martin
      (who left the company's employ in 1992) was also indicted.  On
      October 29, 1992, a jury acquitted Mr. Martin.  The indictment
      charged that between 1986 and 1988 the defendants conspired to
      raise the price of architectural hinges.  On May 16, 1991, the
      company, McKinney Products Company and Lawrence Brothers, Inc.
      entered pleas of nolo contendere with the U.S. District Court for
      the Eastern District of Missouri.  On October 14, 1992, Mr.
      Hollfelder and The Hager Hinge Company pled guilty as a part of
      plea agreements with the government.  On July 13, 1993, the
      company was sentenced to a fine of $6 million, of which $1
      million was to be given to certain educational institutions for
      the purpose of establishing courses and seminars on business
      ethics.    

               (ii)  In July and August 1990, the company was named as
      a defendant in two class actions filed in the California state
      court in San Francisco on behalf of a class of indirect
      purchasers of architectural hinges in California alleging the
      company and others with violations of the California antitrust
      statute.  On December 18, 1991 and February 18, 1992, the
      defendants in these California actions entered into a classwide
      settlement agreement with the plaintiff class representatives. 
      On April 30, 1992, the California state court granted the
      plaintiff's motion for final approval of the class action
      settlements and dismissed the two class actions with prejudice.  
      On December 19, 1991, the company was named as a defendant in a
      third civil action filed in the California state court in Los
      Angeles purporting to sue on behalf of a class of indirect
      purchasers of architectural hinges in California for alleged
      violation of the California antitrust statute.  The plaintiff
      subsequently agreed to participate in, and be bound by, the
      settlement in the San Francisco actions, and to dismiss the Los
      Angeles case voluntarily.  

          3(c) On or about June 21, 1991, a putative class action
      complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District
      of Connecticut naming the company and its directors as
      defendants.  On May 14, 1992, the plaintiffs filed an amended
      complaint, and on or about October 19, 1992, the plaintiffs filed
      a third amended complaint, alleging that (i) the company's proxy
      statement for its 1991 annual meeting violated the federal proxy
      rules by failing to disclose in connection with shareholder
      approval of the company's 1990 Stock Option Plan (the "Stock

      ("Newell") interest in the company and certain discussions
      between Newell and the company's representatives, (ii) the
      director defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the
      company's shareholders by approving the Stock Option Plan and the
      transactions announced on June 7, 1991 solely to thwart a
      combination with Newell, (iii) the director defendants wasted
      corporate assets by, among other things, authorizing the
      prosecution of litigation against Newell, (iv) the director
      defendants wrongfully approved the sale of the company's Common
      Stock to the Employee Stock Ownership Plans ("ESOPs") on June 7,
      1991 without previously disclosing that Newell had made a filing
      under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
      ("Hart-Scott") and (v) the director defendants failed to maximize
      shareholder values by approving transactions that would thwart
      Newell or any other potential acquiror of the company.

               In an opinion and order dated October 26, 1992, the
      court certified the plaintiffs' federal proxy claims to proceed
      on behalf of a class composed of (1) all current shareholders of
      the company, and (2) all company shareholders of record as of
      February 8, 1991 who were entitled to vote at the 1991 Annual
      Meeting of Shareholders or their successors in interest.  The
      court declined to certify the plaintiffs' state law claims
      because these claims were now brought derivatively on behalf of
      the company.

               On June 3, 1993, the court granted final approval to an
      agreement between the parties to settle the class and derivative
      action, and the case was dismissed with prejudice.

          3(d) From time to time Mac Tools, Inc., a wholly owned
      subsidiary of the company ("Mac Tools") has been sued by former
      distributors of Mac Tools alleging breach of contract, breach of
      fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress and
      fraud, and claims based on state unfair trade practices, business
      opportunity and franchise laws, and seeking compensatory and
      punitive damages.  In 1991, a jury in such a suit, awarded the
      plaintiff former distributor compensatory damages of $40,000 and
      punitive damages of $500,000; in 1992, a jury in such a suit,
      awarded $129,000 in compensatory damages and $2.2 million in
      punitive damages.  

               As of the end of 1991 there were 22 such cases pending. 
      During 1992, 38 suits were commenced against Mac Tools and 11
      suits were terminated by settlement, judgment or otherwise.  As
      of the end of 1992, there were 49 such suits pending.  During
      1993, 32 suits were commenced against Mac Tools, Inc. and 17
      suits were terminated by settlement, judgment or otherwise.  As
      of the end of 1993, there were 64 such suits pending.  
         
               The results for 1993 include a fourth quarter charge of
      $15 million to reflect both the late January 1994 settlement of

                                     -8-





      132 filed and threatened lawsuits by former distributors against
      Mac Tools and the accrual of reserves to cover unsettled and
      potential claims.  After these settlements, there were four
      claims outstanding.  The company has taken steps to improve its
      relationship with its distributors and an ombudsman program has
      been established to provide liaison with former distributors. 
      Management believes that these actions will reduce the number and
      size of future settlements and expenses related to this kind of
      litigation and that any such expenses will not have a material
      adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of
      operations or liquidity. 

          3(e) In May 1988, the U.S. Customs Service (the "Customs
      Service") initiated an investigation of possible violations of
      the country-of-origin marking provisions of the U.S. customs laws
      by National Hand Tool Corporation (then a wholly owned subsidiary
      and presently a division of the company) ("NHT").  Section 304 of
      the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. Section 1304, requires that foreign-
      made goods be marked with their country of origin.

               The investigation focused on two types of alleged
      activity that they claim began prior to the company's acquisition
      of NHT in December 1986 and continued until August 1988.  One is
      that NHT personnel are claimed to have removed country-of-origin
      marks from certain hand tools and components (including
      screwdriver shanks, mallets and prybars) that had been imported
      by NHT for assembly and resale.  The other is the alleged failure
      to place foreign origin markings on finished sockets and
      components for socket wrench sets that NHT made from imported
      forgings.  

               On March 2, 1993, the U.S. government instituted an
      action against the company in the United States Court of
      International Trade alleging that NHT had engaged in the
      intentional removal of country-of-origin marks from imported
      screwdrivers, mallets and prybars and failed to place country-of-
      origin markings on forgings that it imported for manufacture into
      sockets and other socket wrench components during the period from
      December 31, 1986 through August 10, 1988.  The suit claimed that
      by these actions the company perpetrated a fraud and effectuated
      the illegal entry of the imported articles into the United States
      in violation of 19 U.S.C. Section 1592, and sought $7,113,951 in civil
      penalties and $592,730 in additional marking duties.  At issue
      were 146 entries, eight of which were of screwdrivers, mallets
      and prybars and 138 of which were of sockets and socket wrench
      parts. 

               The company moved to dismiss this action on various
      grounds, including a failure by Customs to adhere to statutorily
      mandated procedures that are preconditions for judicial actions
      for penalties.  On December 20, 1993, the Court granted the
      company's motion and dismissed the suit, holding that Customs had

                                     -9-





      failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and had denied the
      company a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the
      administrative level.  On February 16, 1994 the U.S. government
      commenced an appeal of this decision.
