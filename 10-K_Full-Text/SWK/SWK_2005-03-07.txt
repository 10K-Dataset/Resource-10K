FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS    Financial information
regarding the Company's business segments is incorporated herein
by reference to the material captioned "Business Segment
Results" in Item 7 and Note P Business Segments and
Geographic Areas of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 15.

1(c)    NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF
BUSINESS

The Company's operations are classified into
three business segments: Consumer Products, Industrial Tools, and
Security Solutions.

Consumer Products

The Consumer
Products segment manufactures and markets hand tools, consumer
mechanics tools and storage units, and hardware. These products are
sold to customers and distributed directly to retailers (including home
centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards) as
well as through third party distributors.

Hand tools include
measuring instruments, planes, hammers, knives and blades,
screwdrivers, saws, chisels, boring tools, masonry, tile and drywall
tools, as well as electronic stud sensors, levels, alignment tools and
elevation measuring systems. The Company markets its hand tools under
the Stanley®, FatMax®, Powerlock®,
IntelliTools

(TM)

and Goldblatt® brands, as well as under
certain retailer's private label brands.

Consumer
mechanics hand tools include wrenches, sockets and tool boxes which are
marketed under the Stanley®, Husky® and ZAG® brands, as
well as under certain retailer's private label brands.

Industrial Tools

The Industrial Tools segment manufactures
and markets professional mechanics tools, pneumatic tools and
fasteners, hydraulic tools and accessories, assembly tools and systems,
and electronic measuring tools. These products are sold to customers
and distributed primarily through third party distributors as well as
through direct sales forces.

Professional mechanics tools
include wrenches, sockets, electronic diagnostic tools, tool boxes and
high-density industrial storage and retrieval systems. Professional
mechanics tools are marketed under the Stanley®, Proto®,
Mac®, Jensen®, Vidmar® and Blackhawk

(TM)

by
Proto® brands.


Pneumatic tools and fasteners include
Bostitch®, Atro® and Stanley ® fastening tools and
fasteners (nails and staples) used for construction, remodeling,
furniture making, pallet manufacturing and other applications involving
the attachment of wooden materials.

Hydraulic tools include
Stanley® hand-held hydraulic tools and accessories used by
contractors, utilities, railroads and public works as well as
LaBounty® mounted demolition hammers and compactors designed to
work on skid steer loaders, mini-excavators, backhoes and large
excavators.

Assembly tools and systems include electric and
pneumatic assembly tools marketed under the Stanley® brand (these
are high performance, precision tools, controllers and systems for
tightening threaded fasteners used chiefly by vehicle
manufacturers).

Electronic measuring tools include laser and
optical leveling and measuring devices utilized primarily by
contractors, surveyors, engineers and other professionals and
do-it-yourself individuals. These products are marketed under the
CST/Berger® and David White® brands.

Security
Solutions

The Security Solutions segment is a provider of
access and security solutions primarily for retailers, educational and
healthcare institutions, government, financial institutions, and
commercial and industrial customers. The company provides an extensive
suite of mechanical and electronic security products and systems, and a
variety of security services. The company manufactures and markets
automatic doors, door locking systems, commercial hardware and security
access control systems. Products in the Security Solutions segment
include security integration systems, software, related installation
and maintenance services, automatic doors, and locking mechanisms.
Security products are marketed under the Stanley®, Blick®,
Frisco Bay®, PAC®, ISR

TM

, WanderGuard® ,
StanVision

TM

and BEST® brands and are sold primarily on
a direct sales basis as well as, in certain instances, through third
party distributors.

Competition

The Company competes on
the basis of its reputation for product quality, its well-known brands,
its commitment to customer service and strong customer relationships,
the breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on product
innovation.

The Company encounters active competition in all of
its businesses from both larger and smaller companies that often offer
the same or similar products and services or that produce different
products appropriate for the same uses. The Company has a large number
of competitors; however, aside from a small number of competitors in
the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware business, who produce a
range of products somewhat comparable to the Company's, the
majority of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more
individual products or product lines within a particular line. The
Company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers of hand
tools in the world featuring a broader line than any other toolmaker.
The Company also believes that it is a leader in the manufacture and
sale of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners to the
construction, furniture and pallet industries as well as a leading
manufacturer of hand-held hydraulic tools used for heavy construction,
railroads, utilities and public works. The Company also believes that
it is among the largest security integration service providers in North
America.

Customers

A substantial portion of the
Company's products in the Consumer Products and Industrial Tools
segments are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution
channels in the U.S. In 2004, sales to The Home Depot were 12%
of the Company's consolidated sales from continuing operations. A
consolidation of retailers both in North America and abroad has
occurred over time. While this consolidation and the domestic and
international expansion of these large retailers provide the Company
with opportunities for growth, the increasing size and importance of
individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential
volume loss. The loss of the customer referred to above as well as
certain of the other larger home centers as customers would have a
material adverse


effect on each of the Company's business
segments until either such customers were replaced or the Company made
the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business.

Despite the trend toward customer consolidation, the Company has a
diversified customer base and has decreased this potential risk over
the past years as sales from continuing operations in markets outside
of the home center and mass merchant distribution channel have grown at
a greater rate through a combination of efforts to broaden the customer
base primarily in the Security Solutions and Industrial Tools
segments.

Raw Materials

The Company's products
are manufactured of steel, aluminum and other metals, as well as wood
and plastic. The raw materials required are available from a number of
sources at competitive prices and the Company has annual contracts with
some of its key suppliers. The Company has occasionally experienced
difficulties in obtaining supplies in recent periods mainly for steel
products. Certain commodity prices, particularly steel, may increase in
2005, but the Company does not anticipate difficulties with respect to
adequate supplies of raw materials.

Backlog

Due to
short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in many of the
Company's businesses, backlog is generally not considered a
significant indicator of future performance. At February 6, 2005, the
Company had approximately $279 million in unfilled orders compared with
$284 million in unfilled orders at March 6, 2004. All of these orders
are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year.
Most customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a result, the
Company produces primarily for inventory, rather than to fill specific
orders.

Patents and Trademarks

No business segment is
dependent, to any significant degree, on patents, licenses, franchises
or concessions and the loss of these patents, licenses, franchises or
concessions would not have a material adverse effect on any of the
business segments. The Company owns numerous patents, none of which are
material to the Company's operations as a whole. These patents
expire at various times over the next 20 years. The Company holds
licenses, franchises and concessions, none of which individually or in
the aggregate is material to the Company's operations as a whole.
These licenses, franchises and concessions vary in duration but
generally run from one to 20 years.

The Company has numerous
trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide. The STANLEY®
and STANLEY in a notched rectangle design trademarks are material to
all three business segments. These well-known trademarks enjoy a
reputation for quality and value and are among the world's most
trusted brand names. The Company's tagline, "Make
Something Great

(TM)

" is the centerpiece of the
brand strategy for all segments. In the Consumer Products and
Industrial Tools segments, the Bostitch®, Powerlock®, Tape Rule
Case Design (Powerlock), FatMax®, LaBounty®, MAC®,
Proto®, Jensen®, Goldblatt®, Husky®, Vidmar®,
CST® and Zag® trademarks are also material to these segments.
In the Security Solutions segment, the BEST®, Blick, Frisco
Bay® and ISR

(TM)

trademarks are also material to this
segment. The terms of these trademarks vary from one to 20 years, with
most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms.

Environmental Regulations

The Company is subject to various
environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries
where it has operations. Future laws and regulations are expected to be
increasingly stringent and will likely increase the Company's
expenditures related to environmental matters.

The Company is a
party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory
agencies relating to environmental remediation. Additionally, the
Company, along with many other companies, has been named as a
potentially responsible party ("PRP") in a
number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of various
waste sites, including ten active Superfund sites.


Current laws potentially impose joint and
several liabilities upon each PRP. In assessing its potential liability
at these sites, the Company has considered the following: the solvency
of the other PRP's, whether responsibility is being disputed, the
terms of existing agreements, experience at similar sites, and the fact
that its volumetric contribution, if any, at these sites is relatively
small.

The Company's policy is to accrue environmental
investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can
be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on
an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each
individual site and includes such factors as existing technology,
presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take
into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties.
As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the
amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As
of January 1, 2005, the Company had reserves of approximately $13.6
million, primarily for remediation activities associated with
Company-owned properties as well as for Superfund sites, for losses
that are probable and estimable.

The amount recorded for
identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates. Amounts
recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
technical and legal information that becomes available. Actual costs to
be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the
inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject
to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the
Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection
with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have
a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

Employees

At
January 1, 2005, the Company had approximately 14,100 employees, nearly
7,500 of whom were employed in the U.S. Approximately 765 U.S.
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated
with 14 different local labor unions who are, in turn, affiliated with
approximately 6 different international labor unions. The majority of
the Company's hourly-paid and weekly-paid employees outside the
U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The
Company's labor agreements in the U.S. expire in 2005, 2006, 2007
and 2008. With the exception of an eleven day strike in New Britain and
Farmington, Connecticut, in 2003 there have been no significant
interruptions or curtailments of the Company's operations in
recent years due to labor disputes. The Company believes that its
relationship with its employees is very good.

BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

The Company has continued to focus on a profitable
growth strategy and to alter its portfolio of businesses. This strategy
encompasses acquisitions and the reduction of risk associated with
certain large customer concentrations. The Company believes this
strategy will improve the overall profitability of operations over the
long term. Over the next several years the Company anticipates more
acquisitions will be made, particularly in the Industrial Tools and
Security Solutions segments. The following events/matters (including
acquisitions and divestitures related to this strategy) had a
significant impact on the Company's financial performance in 2004
and 2003:

•

In 2004, the
acquisitions of Blick plc, CST/Berger, Frisco Bay Industries Ltd., ISR
Solutions Inc., and one small security business were completed at the
total cost of $322 million. Blick is a leading U.K. integrator of
security systems, communication and time management solutions for the
commercial and industrial sectors. CST/Berger is a designer and
manufacturer of laser and optical leveling and measuring equipment.
Frisco Bay is a leading Canadian provider of security systems and
equipment for financial institutions, government agencies and major
corporations. ISR is a North American electronic security integrator
providing the U.S. federal government and commercial customers with
access security systems design, installation and maintenance
services.

•

The Company sold its
Home Décor business during the fourth quarter of 2004 for $87
million, and, therefore, this business was reported as a discontinued
operation for all periods. The after-tax gain recorded on this
transaction was $24 million. The Home Décor business contributed
$0.13, $0.07, and $0.15 of diluted earnings per share in 2004, 2003,
and 2002, respectively. Additionally, a small German business with
annual sales of approximately $20  million, which manufactures
primarily European private label paint rollers, was included in
discontinued operations. The EPS impact of this business to the Company
prior to divestiture was nominal.

•

The Company experienced an
unfavorable impact from unusually high levels of commodity price
inflation (particularly steel) in 2004 and actively pursued price
increases across its channels. These price increase efforts gradually
gained acceptance throughout the year with the Company's
customers. The effect of commodity inflation, and freight cost
increases, was $75 million in 2004, of which approximately 60%
was offset with related price increases to customers. Steel cost and
other inflation impacts, partially offset by price increases, will


continue to have a substantial impact on the
Company in 2005 and potentially beyond. The Company estimates the
carryover impact in 2005 of this inflation at $40-45 million, of which
approximately 80-85% will be offset with the aforementioned
price increase carryover impact. These 2005 estimates assume no change
in existing commodity price levels or the related customer price
levels.

•

The Company acquired
several businesses, primarily Best Access which was completed in
November 2002, which had a significant favorable impact on the
Company's 2003 performance. The total cost of these acquisitions
was $340 million.

•

The Company
entered into a definitive agreement during December 2003 to sell its
Residential Entry Door business and, therefore, this business was
reported as a discontinued operation for all periods. The $161 million
sale was completed in the first quarter of 2004 and the after-tax gain
recorded was $95 million. The Residential Entry Door business
contributed $0.13 and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share in 2003, and
2002, respectively. The impact in 2004 aside from the gain on the sale
was nominal.

•

The Company
announced restructuring plans in April 2003 to improve the
profitability of certain struggling businesses ("Operation
15"). The restructuring was completed in 2003 and included
a workforce reduction of over 1,000 people, the exit from the Mac Tools
retail channel ("MacDirect"), and the
impairment of certain fixed assets and inventories related primarily to
the future consolidation of two distribution facilities.

•

The Company recognized $8 million
in charges related to compensation payable to the former Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, John M. Trani, pertaining to his retirement
effective December 31, 2003. These retirement costs were comprised of
severance and pension as specified in an employment contract entered
into in 2000.

In 2004, the Company implemented a change to its
segment reporting in response to the divestiture and acquisition
activity which arose from the aforementioned strategy. The
Company's operations are now classified into three business
segments: Consumer Products, Industrial Tools, and Security Solutions.
The Consumer Products segment manufactures and markets hand tools,
consumer mechanics tools and storage units, and hardware. These
products are sold to customers and distributed directly to retailers
(including home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail
lumber yards). The Industrial Tools segment manufactures and markets
professional mechanic tools and storage systems, pneumatic tools and
fasteners, assembly tool systems and specialty tools, hydraulic tools
and electronic leveling tools. These products are sold to customers and
distributed either directly or through third party distributors. The
Security Solutions segment manufactures and markets automatic doors,
door locking systems, commercial hardware and security access control
systems, primarily through various direct sales forces.

During
2004 and 2003, the strengthening of the Euro and other foreign
currencies had a significant favorable impact on the translation of
foreign currency-denominated operating results into U.S. dollars. It is
estimated that the favorable impact of foreign currency translation,
including acquired companies, contributed $0.12 and $0.13 of continuing
operations diluted earnings per share in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S.
dollar may have a significant impact on future earnings.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company has provided below a
summary of its operating results at the consolidated level, followed by
an overview of its business segment performance.

Net
Sales:

Net sales from continuing operations were $3,043
million in 2004, as compared to $2,531 million in 2003, a 20%
increase. Excluding 2004 acquisitions, organic sales increased
11% driven by 6% volume growth, improved pricing and
favorable foreign currency impact. The volume growth is due to:
increased industrial tool demand from favorable market conditions;
improved order fulfillment and execution in several businesses; strong
consumer hand and mechanics tool demand from home center and mass
merchant customers; and increased Security revenues primarily due to
share gains in


automated door products. The 2004 net sales
volume performance was significant considering the Company had a
52-week 2004 reporting period versus a 53-week reporting period last
year. Favorable foreign currency translation, primarily European,
increased net sales by 2%. The impact of pricing resulted in a
net sales increase of 3%, mainly as a result of the Company
actively pursuing price increases to offset commodity inflation. Other
pricing actions associated with more effective price management
routines resulted in an additional $20-$25 million of benefit.

Net sales from continuing operations were $2,531 million for 2003,
as compared to $2,234 million in 2002, a 13% increase.
Acquisitions contributed $266 million, or a 12% increase of net
sales. Overall, organic sales volume declined 2%, offset by
favorable foreign currency translation of 3% due primarily to
the movement in European currencies. Organic sales volume declined
mainly due to the termination of the MacDirect program under the
Operation 15 initiative combined with customer inventory corrections in
the industrial and consumer channels in the first half of 2003. These
sales declines were partially offset by strong fourth quarter 2003
demand in U.S. hand and mechanics tools, and expanding service
operations and share gains at national accounts in the automated doors
operation.

Significant Charges and Credits:

In 2004,
the Company recorded $4 million of pre-tax restructuring costs in
connection with specific personnel actions to streamline/reposition
certain organizations, $4  million of impairment charges
primarily associated with a 2004 information system strategy decision,
and a $2 million provision for recent litigation. Additionally, an $8
million credit to income taxes was recorded as a result of favorable
resolutions of tax audits, increased utilization of foreign net
operating loss carry forwards and specific acquisition tax-planning
activities.

In 2003, the Company recorded $108 million of
pre-tax restructuring costs, impairment charges, and other exit costs
in connection with the Operation 15 initiative. Certain expenses
totaling $8 million related to the retirement of the Company's
former Chairman and CEO were recorded in addition to Operation 15
charges. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded $3 million
in restructuring reserves for initiatives pertaining to the further
reduction of its cost structure, primarily for severance-related
obligations. A summary of the pre-tax charges recorded in 2003 related
to these matters is as
follows:

These
charges were classified within the 2003 Consolidated Statement of
Operations as follows: (i)  Cost of sales — $20 million;
(ii) SG&A and Provision for doubtful accounts — $37 million;
(iii)  Other-net — $10 million; and (iv) Restructuring and
asset impairment charges — $52 million. Additionally, the 2003
income taxes reflect favorable foreign tax developments that resulted
in a credit of $2 million.

In 2002, the Company reported a
second quarter U.S. pension settlement pre-tax gain of $18 million.
Also in the second quarter, the Company incurred $8 million in
severance and related expenses associated with selling, general and
administrative cost reductions. In the third quarter, the Company
reported a $6 million credit to income taxes related to a favorable
foreign tax development. In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded
$22 million in non-cash charges for increased inventory and


receivable loss provisions and for specific
manufacturing equipment impairments related to the following: (1) a
reassessment of Mac Tools inventory and accounts receivable valuations,
as a result of a then new retail control system; (2) an inventory
valuation adjustment in Fastening Systems associated with cost
estimation process improvements; and (3) impairment of certain fixed
assets related primarily to the Wichita Falls and Dallas, Texas plants
consolidation. Also in the fourth quarter the Company recorded $5.6
million of accounting corrections. These corrections relate primarily
to expense capitalization and depreciation. Other significant credits
in 2002 include $11 million in environmental income arising from a
settlement with an insurance carrier recognized in the third and fourth
quarters. These credits and charges were classified within the 2002
Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows: (i) Net sales —
$1 million charge; (ii) Cost of sales — $17 million charge; (iii)
SG&A expenses — $10 million charge; (iv) Other-net —
$21 million credit; and (v) Income taxes — $6  million
credit.

Gross Profit:

The Company reported gross
profit from continuing operations of $1,112 million, or 36% of
net sales, in 2004, compared to $858 million, or 34% of net
sales, in the prior year. The businesses acquired increased gross
profit by $105 million. The remaining $149 million improvement was
primarily attributed to increased sales volume discussed previously,
gross profit rate improvement, and $20 million of inventory losses
recorded in 2003 related to the termination of the MacDirect
distribution model and the planned consolidation of two major
distribution facilities in conjunction with Operation 15. The gross
profit rate improvement was attributable to the carryover benefit of
2003 restructuring programs, volume leverage, favorable pricing and
improved product mix. These benefits were partially offset by higher
steel costs and other inflation. The Company experienced a significant
impact from unusually high levels of commodity price inflation
(particularly steel) in 2004. The Company has actively pursued price
increases in many business channels to partially offset this negative
impact. The effect of commodity inflation and freight increases was $75
million in 2004, of which approximately 60% was offset with
related price increases to customers. Steel cost and other inflation
increases, partially offset by price increases, will continue to have a
substantial impact on the Company in 2005 and potentially beyond.

The Company reported gross profit from continuing operations of $858
million, or 34% of net sales, in 2003, compared to $748 million,
or 33% of net sales, in 2002. Excluding the $128 million
favorable impact of acquisitions, gross profit declined slightly as
compared with 2002 primarily due to organic sales volume declines
discussed previously, $20 million of inventory losses recorded in
conjunction with Operation 15, and higher retirement plan costs. These
negatives were partially offset by favorable material and other
efficiency variances.

SG&A expenses

:    Selling,
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations,
inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts, were $694 million, or
23% of net sales in 2004, compared to $616 million, or
24% of net sales, in the prior year. The increase of $78 million
was primarily attributed to acquired businesses that increased costs by
$62 million, higher business portfolio SG&A spending levels in
connection with the strong organic net sales increase, increased
funding for brand support, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs, and foreign
currency translation. Additional factors impacting this comparison were
accounts receivable losses of $25 million which related to the exiting
of the MacDirect distribution model and $8 million of costs pertaining
to the retirement of the Company's former CEO which were both
recorded in 2003.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
from continuing operations, inclusive of the provision for doubtful
accounts, were $616 million, or 24% of net sales in 2003,
compared to $505 million, or 23% of net sales, in the prior
year. The increase relates to $70 million of incremental expenses from
acquisitions, $25 million of receivable losses associated with the
MacDirect exit, $8 million of costs related to the retirement of the
Company's former CEO, higher retirement plan costs, and the
negative impact from foreign currency translation.

Interest
and Other-net:

Net interest expense from continuing operations
in 2004 was $34 million, an increase of $6 million over 2003. The 2003
net interest expense from continuing operations represents a $4 million
increase from the $24 million in 2002. The three year trend of
increases was driven by higher borrowings due to the acquisitions
discussed previously, partially offset by lower interest rates.


Other-net from continuing operations
represented $47 million of expense in 2004, an increase of nearly $8
million from expense of $39 million in 2003. The increase is primarily
the result of increased intangible amortization expense of $10 million
associated with recent acquisitions. Additionally, there was a
significant cost increase and decrease which offset one another –
a $10 million increase in currency losses from 2003 levels was offset
by reduced losses on the MacAdvantage finance program in 2004 versus
2003.

Other-net from continuing operations was $39 million in
expense for 2003 compared to $9 million in income for 2002. The
increase in costs is primarily the result of an $18 million gain in
2002 from the U.S. pension settlement, $12 million of higher losses in
2003 related to the Company's MacAdvantage financing program, a
$6 million loss on the sale of the Mac Tools distributor receivable
portfolio (an Operation 15 initiative) in 2003, increased intangible
amortization expense of $10 million in 2003 associated with
acquisitions, and $11 million in income from an environmental
settlement with an insurance carrier in 2002, which was slightly offset
by a $2 million increase in other environmental expense.

Income Taxes

:    The Company's effective income tax
rate from continuing operations for 2004 was 27% as compared to
26% for 2003 and 31% for 2002.

The tax rate for
the past two years reflects the continued benefit of a higher
percentage of taxable income in countries with lower statutory rates,
primarily in Europe and the Far East. Additionally, an $8 million
credit to income taxes was recorded in 2004 as a result of favorable
resolutions of tax audits, increased utilization of foreign net
operating loss carry forwards and specific acquisition tax-planning
activities. The 2003 effective income tax rate was affected further by
the tax benefit from the Operation 15 charges which were predominately
U.S. based. Additionally, the 2003 and 2002 income taxes reflect
favorable foreign tax developments that reduced income taxes by $2
million and $6 million, respectively. The 2002 favorable development
was offset by the impact of non-deductible excise tax associated with
the termination of a defined benefit pension plan.

Business
Segment Results

:    The Company utilizes operating profit, which
is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and SG&A, inclusive of
the provision for doubtful accounts, and its percentage of net sales as
measurements to evaluate the profitability of each segment. Segment
operating profit excludes interest income, interest expense, other-net,
restructuring charges and asset impairments, as well as income tax
expense.

Consumer
Products net sales from continuing operations in 2004 represented a
12% increase from 2003, driven by the aforementioned strength in
home center and mass merchant channels in the U.S. and favorable
currency impacts in Europe. Of this 12% increase, volume
represented 7% which was driven by growth in hand tools,
consumer mechanics tools and storage units as a result of improved
order fulfillment, increased brand support, and higher market demand,
which was partially offset by volume declines in hardware products.
Currency represented 4% and pricing 1% of the net sales
increase. Operating margin improved 70 basis points primarily due to
improved operating leverage from higher sales volumes, pricing and
favorable product mix; however these factors were partially offset by
the previously mentioned commodity cost inflation (primarily steel and
resin), increased brand support and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs.
Additionally, 2003 consumer products operating profit was impacted by
$3 million in Operation 15 charges previously mentioned.

Consumer Products net sales from continuing operations in 2003
increased 5% as compared to 2002. The sales increased primarily
from favorable foreign currency translation due mainly to European
currencies. The volume increased slightly as a result of strong fourth
quarter 2003 demand in the U.S. Hand Tools business which was offset
partially by consumer channel customers inventory corrections in the
first half of 2003. Consumer products operating profit was impacted by
the charges previously mentioned totaling $3 million in 2003 and $6
million in 2002. The remaining $16 million increase in


operating profit is primarily due to improved
shift in business mix and favorable material and productivity
variances, partially offset by higher retirement plan costs and further
price erosion in 2003 versus
2002.

Industrial
Tools net sales increased 18% from 2003. Excluding the
CST/Berger acquisition, organic sales increased 12%. Volume
represented 6% of the organic sales increase; and price and
currency were 4% and 2%, respectively. This organic
volume improvement was the result of better economic conditions,
improved management execution in several businesses and improved order
fulfillment related to industrial mechanic tool, assembly tool,
specialty tool, and hydraulic tool products. Mac Tools net sales
decreased 4% as sluggish market conditions impacted this
business in the fourth quarter of 2004 combined with traditional
distributor additions and higher route average sales only partially
offsetting the anticipated decline from last year's MacDirect
exit. The majority of the price increase was due to the Company's
actions in response to commodity inflation as previously discussed. The
significant improvement in the 2004 operating profit and margin rate is
the result of charges in 2003 totaling $52 million mainly from
receivable and inventory losses associated with the MacDirect exit, as
well as higher sales volume, substantial improvement in the margin
performances of Mac Tools and industrial mechanics tools as a result of
the carryover benefits from prior year restructuring programs, and the
acquisition of CST/Berger. These favorable factors were partially
offset by the previously mentioned commodity cost inflation, as
approximately two-thirds of the total company's commodity
inflation (net of price recovery) impacted this segment, and
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs.

Industrial Tools net sales in
2003 decreased 1% as compared to 2002. The sales volume
decreased as a result of declining sales from the termination of the
MacDirect program under the Operation 15 initiative and industrial
channel customers inventory corrections in the first half of 2003,
offset partially by strong fourth quarter 2003 demand in the U.S.
mechanics tools business and favorable foreign currency translation due
primarily to the European currencies. Industrial Tools operating profit
was impacted by the charges previously mentioned totaling $52 million
in 2003 and $21 million in 2002. The remaining $21 million decrease in
2003 operating profit is primarily due to significant price erosion and
lack of manufacturing productivity (primarily in the fastening
business), unfavorable shifts in business mix, and higher retirement
plan
costs.

Security
Solutions sales increased 43% in 2004. Excluding the
acquisitions (primarily Blick plc, Frisco Bay Industries Ltd., and ISR
Solutions Inc.), organic sales increased 6%. Sales volume
represented 4% of the organic increase and price was 2%.
The organic volume improvement was due to strength in the supply and
service of automatic commercial door systems in access technologies.
Best Access sales volume was virtually unchanged compared to 2003
levels while incoming orders increased, reflecting a shift in mix
toward longer order cycle electronic access systems. The operating
profit increase is primarily attributed to the impact of 2004
acquisitions. Operating margin was relatively flat versus 2003,
primarily attributable to favorable business mix and pricing actions
with customers; these favorable impacts were offset by increased
commodity inflation, field productivity issues at Best Access,
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs and key strategic consulting
expenditures.

Security Solutions sales increased by $262 million
in 2003. Excluding the impact of acquisitions (primarily Best Access)
totaling $255 million, Security Solutions organic sales increased
3% and volume generated the majority of this increase. The
organic volume improvement was due to strength


in the supply and service of automatic
commercial door systems in access technologies, partially offset by
market share declines in the commercial hardware product line.
Operating profit increased significantly primarily as a result of
acquisitions.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES

In the fourth
quarter of 2004, the Company recorded $8 million of restructuring and
asset impairment charges — $4 million of restructuring costs in
connection with specific personnel actions to streamline/reposition
certain organizations primarily in the consumer and industrial
segments; and $4 million of asset impairment charges primarily
associated with a 2004 information system strategy decision.

In
2003, the Company recorded $49 million in restructuring and asset
impairment charges for the Operation 15 initiative. These charges
consisted of $12 million for severance, $26 million of asset
impairments and $11 million of other exit costs related to the exit
from the Company's MacDirect retail channel. The asset
impairments generally relate to assets which are idle mainly as a
result of restructuring initiatives and accordingly their book value
has been written down to fair value.

In 2003, the Company also
recorded $3 million in restructuring charges for initiatives pertaining
to the further reduction of its cost structure, primarily for
severance-related obligations. As of January 3, 2004, no accrual
remained as all of the severance had been expended.

At January
1, 2005, the restructuring and asset impairment reserve balance was $5
million, which the Company expects to be fully expended by the end of
2005. A summary of the Company's restructuring reserves for the
years ended January 3, 2004 to January 1, 2005 is as follows:

For
the three years ended January 1, 2005, 21 facilities have been closed
as a result of restructuring initiatives. In 2004, 2003 and 2002,
approximately 160, 1,100 and 1,000 employees have been terminated as a
result of restructuring initiatives, respectively. Severance payments
of $4 million, $18 million and $26 million and other exit costs of $4
million, $10 million and $4 million were made in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Write-offs of impaired assets were $11 million, $18
million and $6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Integration of certain acquisitions requires reduction of redundant
personnel, closure of facilities, and other restructuring actions
related to the acquired businesses. In such cases, a restructuring
accrual is recorded for actions identified in integration strategy
plans initially developed by the Company as of the acquisition date,
with a resulting increase to goodwill. As integration strategies are
executed, the Company monitors the previously established restructuring
accruals and makes adjustments to such accruals to the extent actual
expenditures differ from the estimated accruals. Adjustments recorded
to previously established restructuring accruals until the time
integration plans are fully executed, not to exceed one year from date
of original acquisition, are reflected in the final goodwill amount
included in the purchase price allocation. Adjustments made subsequent
to the finalization of integration


strategies, or after one year from the date
of original acquisition, are reflected in the Company's results
of operations. The Company recorded $5 million in restructuring
reserves, primarily for severance, in connection with its first quarter
2004 acquisitions. Restructuring reserves pertaining to the 2002 Best
acquisition were $6 million, comprised of $5 million for severance and
$1  million in exit costs primarily for non-cancelable leases.
All but $0.3 million of these acquisition related reserves were
expended by January 1, 2005.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity, Sources and Uses of Capital:

The
Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from
operations and borrowings under various credit facilities.

The
Company has historically generated strong cash flows from operations.
In 2004, cash flow from operations was $372 million, as compared to
$464 million in 2003. Working capital improvements were $45 million
higher in 2003 as compared with 2004. In addition, in 2003 there were
favorable impacts of $57 million for income tax deferrals and refunds,
as well as approximately $40 million in cash proceeds from the sale of
the Mac Tools distributor financing portfolio which did not reoccur in
2004. These items were partially offset by improved net earnings from
continuing operations and lower cash payments related to restructuring
and other charges in 2004 versus 2003.

In 2003, cash flow from
operations was $464 million, as compared to $285 million in 2002. The
increase is the result of working capital improvements of $32 million
as compared to 2002 improvements, primarily from receivables and
inventories, cash proceeds of approximately $40 million from the sale
of the Mac Tools distributor financing portfolio, income tax payment
deferrals and refunds aggregating $57 million, and $17 million in lower
cash payments related to restructuring and other charges in 2003 versus
2002.

Capital expenditures were $55 million in 2004, $39 million
in 2003, and $52 million in 2002. The Company incurred higher capital
expenditures in 2004 for investment in various plants including
manufacturing productivity projects, movement of production to low cost
countries, and increased costs for software development and
acquisitions as the Company continues to improve the infrastructure of
its systems.

Free cash flow, as defined in the table below, was
$317 million in 2004 and $425 million in 2003, considerably exceeding
net earnings from continuing operations in a period of continued strong
sales volume growth. The Company believes free cash flow is an
important measure of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund
future growth and provide a return to the shareowners.

The
Company received net proceeds from sales of the Residential Entry Door
and Home Décor businesses of $205 million in 2004, and disbursed
$301 million for business acquisitions. Additionally, as a result of
the previously mentioned strong free cash flow from operations, the
Company made $133 million in net payments on borrowings resulting in a
2004 year end 32.4% debt to capital ratio. This ratio was
43.6% at the end of 2003. The Company believes it has achieved
its deleveraging goals and is well-positioned for capitalizing on
future acquisition opportunities.

During 2003, the Company made
$260 million in payments on borrowings. In the second quarter 2003, the
Company repurchased 3.9 million shares of common stock and agreed to
settle the remainder of its equity hedge through the repurchase of 4.1
million shares over the next four years. The 3.9 million share
repurchase was made with $100 million of cash and increased commercial
paper borrowings while the 4.1 million share repurchase involved $113
million of term debt. No open market purchase


of shares occurred. These repurchases of
shares under the equity hedge contract, repayment of debt and currency
fluctuation, resulted in a $20 million decrease in the Company's
short-term and long-term borrowings.

In 2002, the Company
received $338 million in net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt,
and disbursed $356 million for business acquisitions. The Company made
$154 million in payments on borrowings.

In 2004, the Company
took advantage of favorable market conditions by refinancing its 364
day and long term (multi-year) credit arrangements, creating a long
term credit facility with several U.S. banks to borrow up to $400
million at the lower of prime or money market rates. This long term
credit facility matures in October 2009. In addition, the Company has
short-term lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating $161
million, of which $120 million was available at January 1, 2005.
Short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal. Of the $561
million aggregate credit lines, $400 million is available to support
the Company's commercial paper program. In addition to these
lines of credit, the Company maintains a facility designed for the
securitization of certain trade accounts receivable for purposes of
additional liquidity. As of January 1, 2005, the Company's
maximum available funds under this arrangement were $122 million, of
which $12 million was utilized.

In 2003, the Company filed a
Shelf Registration in the amount of $900 million.   This filing
represents a prospectus which, if accompanied by a prospectus
supplement, would allow the Company to offer, issue and sell, together
or separately, debt, equity and other securities.

The Company
also has numerous assets, predominantly vehicles and equipment, under a
one-year term renewable U.S. master personal property lease. Residual
value obligations, which approximate the fair value of the related
assets, under this master lease were $24 million at January 1, 2005.
The Company does not anticipate any material liabilities associated
with these transactions.

Contractual
Obligations:

The following summarizes the Company's
significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its
liquidity.

Other
Commercial
Commitments:


Short-term borrowings, long-term debt and
lines of credit are explained in detail within Note I Long Term Debt
and Financing Arrangements; and operating leases and other commercial
commitments are explained in detail in Note R Commitments and
Guarantees of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 15.

The Company believes that its dividend is an important
factor in generating returns for the shareowners. The Company's
long term policy is to increase dividends by up to one-half of the
Company's earnings growth rate, ultimately reaching a payout
ratio of 25% of net earnings. Dividend increases are determined
periodically in light of this policy and other considerations.
Dividends increased 4.9% in 2004, 4.0% in 2003 and
5.3% in 2002. The Company plans to use a significant portion of
free cash flow after dividends (operating cash flow less dividends and
capital expenditures) to fund future acquisitions in commercial and
industrial markets.

MARKET RISK

Market risk is the
potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the
fair value of financial instruments. The Company is exposed to market
risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates. Exposure to foreign currency risk results because the Company,
through its global businesses, enters into transactions and makes
investments denominated in multiple currencies. The Company's
predominant exposures are in European, Canadian and Asian currencies,
including the Chinese RMB. Certain cross-currency trade flows arising
from sales and procurement activities are consolidated and netted prior
to obtaining risk protection, primarily purchased options. The Company
is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking
advantage of naturally offsetting exposures to reduce the cost of
purchasing protection. At times, the Company also enters into forward
exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and
cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and
payables, predominately affiliate transactions. Gains and losses from
these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying
net exposures, assets and liabilities being hedged. Management
determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities, and in
certain cases, may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain
unhedged. The Company has also entered into several cross-currency
interest rate swaps, to provide a partial hedge of the net investments
in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations
to debt service requirements. Sensitivity to foreign currency exposure
risk from these financial instruments at the end of 2004 would have
been immaterial based on the potential loss in fair value from a
hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all currencies. The Company
generally does not hedge commodity price exposures.

The
Company's exposure to interest rate risk results from its
outstanding debt obligations, short-term investments, and derivative
financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio.
The debt portfolio is managed to achieve capital structure targets and
reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed
and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and
cross-currency swaps. The Company's primary exposure to interest
rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the U.S. and Europe and
is fairly represented by changes in LIBOR rates. At January 1, 2005,
the result of a hypothetical two percentage point increase in
short-term LIBOR rates would not have resulted in a material impact on
the pre-tax profit of the Company.

Fluctuations in the fair
value of the Company's common stock affect ESOP expense as
discussed in the U.S. Pension and ESOP section of Management Discussion
and Analysis.

Sales to The Home Depot amounted to 12% of
2004 consolidated net sales from continuing operations. The Company has
other significant customers, particularly home centers and major
retailers, though individually there are no others that exceed
10% of consolidated sales. The loss or material reduction of
business from any such significant customer could have a material
adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and cash
flows, until either such customers were replaced or the Company made
the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business.

The Company has access to financial resources and borrowing
capabilities around the world. There are no material instruments within
the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a
change in credit rating, and no significantly restrictive covenants.
The Company believes that its


strong financial position, operating cash
flows and borrowing capacity provide the financial flexibility
necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments, to invest
in the routine needs of its businesses, to make strategic acquisitions
and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy.

OTHER MATTERS

Income Taxes

:    In October 2004,
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the
"Act") was signed into law. The Act creates a
temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed
foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent dividends received
deduction. As of January 1, 2005, the Company has not provided for U.S.
income and foreign withholding taxes on $324 million of undistributed
foreign earnings that are considered to be invested indefinitely
outside the United States. The Company may elect to repatriate some
amount up to $324 million resulting in recognition of a tax liability
of up to $42 million. The Company is awaiting the issuance of further
regulatory guidance and statutory corrections with respect to certain
provisions in the Act in order to determine the amounts it may
repatriate, and expects to be in a position to finalize its assessment
during 2005.

Environmental:

The Company incurs costs
related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and
regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of
previously contaminated sites. Future laws and regulations are expected
to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the
Company's expenditures related to routine environmental
matters.

The Company accrues for anticipated costs associated
with investigatory and remediation efforts in accordance with
appropriate accounting guidelines which address probability and the
ability to reasonably estimate future costs. The liabilities are
reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation
efforts and their costs can be better estimated. Subject to the
imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company
believes that any sum it may pay in connection with environmental
matters in excess of the amounts recorded will not have a materially
adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or
liquidity. Refer to Note S Contingencies of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further information on
environmental liabilities and related cash flows.

U.S.
Pension and ESOP

:    In 2002, the Company recorded an $18 million
pre-tax pension settlement gain in Other-net. This involved the
termination and settlement of the primary U.S. salaried employee plan
as well as settlement of most of the liabilities in the ongoing plan
for hourly employees. In addition to the settlement gain, the Company
recorded $8 million of operating income related to these plans in 2002,
whereas in 2003 and 2004 the ongoing hourly plan resulted in
approximately $2 million of expense.

As detailed in Note M
Employee Benefit Plans of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 15, the Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP) under which the ongoing U.S. defined contribution and (401K)
plans are funded. Overall ESOP expense is affected by the market value
of Stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released. In
2004, the market value of shares released averaged $43.20 per share and
the net ESOP expense was $2 million. In 2003, the market value of
shares released averaged $29.30 per share and the net ESOP expense was
$9 million. ESOP expense may vary in the future as the market value of
the Company's common stock fluctuates.

The Company
provides a 5% guaranteed rate of return on participant
contributions made to the tax deferred savings plan (401K) prior to
July 1998 when all contributions were invested in Stanley common stock.
The value of the shares participants purchased prior to July 1998 along
with the 5% cumulative guaranteed rate of return on Stanley
common stock is known as an Investment Protection Account (IPA).
Beginning in July 1998 the investment options for plan participant
contributions were enhanced to include a variety of investment funds in
addition to the Company's common stock, and there is no
guaranteed rate of return to participants on any contributions made
after that time. The IPA guarantee is included in the actuarial
valuation of the ongoing U.S. pension plan. Payments related to the IPA
guarantees, if they have any value, would be made to participants over
a period of many years generally as they retire. In the event the
market value of Stanley common stock declines


below $43.59 (which is the stock price at
which there was a settlement of this liability) additional costs may be
triggered by the IPA benefit guarantee.

NEW ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

Refer to Note A Significant Accounting Policies of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for a
discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to
the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial
position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Preparation of
the Company's financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Significant accounting policies
used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are
described in Note A Significant Accounting Policies in Item 15.
Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because
of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result
primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters
with inherent uncertainty. The most significant areas involving
management estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas
could differ from management's estimates.

Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts

:    Stanley's estimate for its allowance
for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two
methods. The amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined
to determine the total amount reserved. First, the Company evaluates
specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an
inability to meet financial obligations, such as bankruptcy. In these
cases, the Company uses its judgment, based on the best available facts
and circumstances, to record a specific reserve for those customers
against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to
be collected. These specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as
additional information is received. Second, a reserve is established
for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to
receivables aging categories. These percentages are based on historical
collection and write-off experience. If circumstances change, for
example the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a material
adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its
financial obligation to the Company, estimates of the recoverability of
receivable amounts due could be reduced.

Inventories –
Lower of Cost or Market, Slow Moving and Obsolete

:    U.S.
inventories are predominantly valued at the lower of LIFO cost or
market. The calculation of LIFO reserves, and therefore the net
inventory valuation, is affected by inflation and deflation in
inventory components. The Company ensures all inventory is valued at
the lower of cost or market, and continually reviews the book value of
discontinued product lines and stock-keeping-units (SKUs) to determine
that these items are properly valued. The Company also continually
evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete
and/or slow-moving inventories. Inventory items identified as obsolete
and/or slow-moving are evaluated to determine if reserves are required.
The Company identifies these inventories and assesses the ability to
dispose of them at a price greater than cost. If it is determined that
cost is less than market value, then cost is used for inventory
valuation. If market value is less than cost, then the Company writes
down the related inventory to that value. If a write down to the
current market value is necessary, the market value cannot be greater
than the net realizable value, or ceiling (defined as selling price
less costs to sell and dispose), and cannot be lower than the net
realizable value less a normal profit margin, also called the floor. If
the Company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net
realizable value of inventory at its current value, reserves would have
to be adjusted accordingly.

Goodwill and Intangible
Assets

:    The Company completed acquisitions in 2004 and 2003
valued at $322 million and $23 million, respectively. The assets and
liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase
method at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill
represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying
net assets of acquired businesses. The Company had recorded goodwill of
$640 million and $79 million of indefinite-lived tradenames at January
1, 2005.


In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not
amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. The
identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangibles
impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting
units. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the
best information available at the date of assessment, which primarily
incorporate management assumptions about future cash flows. Future cash
flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or
the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are
realized with newly acquired entities. While the Company has not
recorded intangibles impairment losses in several years, it is possible
impairments may occur in the future in the event expected cash flows
change significantly. Specifically, the Specialty Tools and Fastening
Systems reporting units had experienced operating profit and margin
rate declines in 2003 and 2002 due to the depressed technology industry
and intensified competition, respectively. In 2004, however, both
Fastening Systems and Specialty Tools operating profits and margin
rates increased due to improved market conditions and strong execution
by management. Specialty Tools and Fastening Systems had $73 million
and $41 million, respectively, of recorded goodwill at January 1, 2005.
There is potential for future goodwill and intangible impairment losses
if projected profits and cash flows significantly decline from current
estimates. See Note G Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other
Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 15 for further discussion.

Property, Plant and
Equipment (PP&E)

:    The Company generally values PP&E at
historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Impairment losses are
recorded when indicators of impairment, such as plant closures, are
present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by
those assets are less than the carrying amount. The impairment loss is
quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the
weighted average discounted cash flows, which consider various possible
outcomes for the disposition of the assets (i.e. sale, leasing, etc.).
Primarily as a result of plant rationalization, certain facilities and
equipment are not currently used in operations. The Company has
recorded impairment losses related to unused assets and additional such
losses may occur in the future.

Risk Insurance

:    To
some extent, the Company self insures for various business exposures.
For domestic workers' compensation and product liability, the
Company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe
losses ("stop loss" insurance). The two risk
areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are
workers' compensation and product liability (liability for
alleged injuries associated with the Company's products).
Actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form
the basis for workers' compensation and product liability loss
reserves recorded. The actuary contemplates the Company's
specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends
among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserve
required. Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves
for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development
of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims.
The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by
third party administrator specialists (insurance companies) for
workers' compensation and by in-house legal counsel in
consultation with outside attorneys for product liability. The cash
outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over
approximately 8 to 10 years, and the present value of expected future
claim payments is reserved. The Company believes the liability recorded
for such risk insurance reserves as of January 1, 2005 is adequate, but
due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the
ultimate costs will differ from this estimate.

Income
Taxes

:    The future tax benefit arising from net deductible
temporary differences and tax carryforwards is $56 million at January
1, 2005 and $84 million at January 3, 2004. The Company believes
earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become
deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax
benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax
carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that
realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. The
valuation allowance as of January 1, 2005 amounted to $37
million.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the
Company estimates future taxable income, considering the feasibility of
ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss


carryforwards. Valuation allowances related
to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes
to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event
the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all
or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable
amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that
determination is made. By contrast, if the Company were to determine
that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in
excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded
valuation allowance through a favorable earnings adjustment in the
period in which that determination is made.

The Company
periodically assess its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years
still under audit based on the most current available information. When
it is deemed probable that an adjustment will be asserted, the Company
accrues its best estimate of the tax liability, inclusive of related
interest charges. See Note Q Income Taxes of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further
discussion.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The
Company's off-balance sheet arrangements include the
following:

Receivable Securitizations

:    The Company
has agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, pools of accounts and
notes receivables to a Qualified Special Purpose Entity (QSPE), which
qualifies to be accounted for as an unconsolidated subsidiary. The
entity is designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade
accounts receivable. Assets and related debt off-balance sheet were
both $12 million at January 1, 2005. The Company is responsible for
servicing these accounts while the QSPE bears the risk of
non-collection. There were no sales of eligible receivables in 2004, as
the securitization was reduced by $42 million during the year.

In 2003 the Company acquired a third party's interest in a
Special Purpose Entity (SPE) which supported the Mac Tools extended
financing programs. As a result, the entity became non-qualifying and
the net assets which consisted primarily of notes receivable of $56.4
million at January 3, 2004 were consolidated in the Company's
balance sheet. No gains or losses related to sales to the SPE were
recorded. During 2003, the Company sold $39 million of receivables in
this portfolio to a third party. In 2004, the majority of the remaining
portfolio was sold without recourse for $50 million, and the SPE was
dissolved. The Company has outsourced both of the Mac Tools extended
financing programs to third parties and has thus reduced its exposure
to future credit losses.

Synthetic Leases

:    The
Company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for two of its major
distribution centers. The programs qualify as operating leases for
accounting purposes, such that only the monthly rent expense is
recorded in the Statement of Operations and the liability and value of
the underlying assets are off-balance sheet. These lease programs are
utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility. As
of January 1, 2005, the estimated fair value of assets and remaining
obligations for these two properties were $50 million and $42 million,
respectively.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE
SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain statements
contained in this Annual Report to shareowners, including the
statements regarding the Company's ability: (i) to improve the
overall profitability of the Company's operations; (ii) to limit
the carryover impact of steel cost and other inflation increases in
2005 to $40-45 million and to offset 80-85% of that impact
through the carryover impact of price increases; (iii) to capitalize on
future acquisition opportunities and fund other initiatives; (iv) to
invest in the routine needs of its business; and (v) to continue its
record of annual dividend payments and to increase such dividends are
forward looking and are based on current expectations and involve
inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors listed below and
other factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could
cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from current
expectations.

The Company's ability to achieve the results
described above (the "Results") is dependent
on: (i)  the success of the Company's efforts to
efficiently and promptly integrate its recently announced (as well


as future) acquisitions; (ii) the success of
the Company's efforts to hold freight costs, steel and other
commodity costs down; (iii) the success of the Company's efforts
to sustain or increase prices in order to, among other things, offset
the impact of steel cost and other inflation increases; (iv) continued
improvements in productivity and cost reductions; (v) the
identification of overhead cost reduction opportunities and effective
execution of the same; (vi) the Company's successful settlement
of routine tax audits; (vii) the ability of the Company to generate
earnings sufficient to realize future income tax benefits during
periods when temporary differences become deductible; (viii) the
continued ability of the Company to access credit markets under
satisfactory terms; and (ix) satisfactory payment terms under which the
Company buys and sells goods, materials and products.

The
Company's ability to deliver the Results also is dependent upon:
(i) the continued success of the Company's marketing and sales
efforts, including the Company's ability to recruit and retain an
adequate sales force; (ii) the continued success of The Home Depot,
Lowe's and Wal-Mart sales initiatives as well as other programs
to stimulate demand for company products; (iii) the success of
recruiting programs and other efforts to maintain or expand overall Mac
Tools truck count versus prior years; (iv) the ability of the sales
force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and
achieve adequate customer coverage; (v) the ability of the Company to
fulfill increasing demand for its products; (vi) the ability to
continue successfully managing and defending claims and litigation; and
(vii) the absence or mitigation of increased pricing pressures from
customers and competitors and the ability to defend market share in the
face of price competition.

The Company's ability to
achieve the Results will also be affected by external factors. These
external factors include pricing pressure and other changes within
competitive markets, the continued consolidation of customers
particularly in consumer channels, inventory management pressures on
the Company's customers, increasing competition, changes in
trade, monetary, tax and fiscal policies and laws, inflation, currency
exchange fluctuations, the impact of dollar/foreign currency exchange
and interest rates on the competitiveness of products and the
Company's debt program, the strength of the US economy and the
impact of events that cause or may cause disruption in the
company's distribution and sales networks such as war, terrorist
activities, political unrest and recessionary or expansive trends in
the economies of the world in which the Company operates.

Unless
required by applicable federal securities laws, the Company undertakes
no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the
date hereof.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

The management of The Stanley Works is
responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with generally


accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of The Stanley
Works' internal control over financial reporting as of
January  1, 2005. In making its assessment, management has
utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control
– Integrated Framework. Management concluded that based on its
assessment, The Stanley Works' internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of January 1, 2005. Management's
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of ISR
Solutions, Inc., a company acquired in December 2004, with total assets
of approximately $50 million as reflected in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet and a nominal earnings impact. Ernst  & Young LLP, the
auditor of the financial statements included in this annual report on
Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on management's
assessment of internal controls, a copy of which appears on page
33.

There has been no change in The Stanley Works'
internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter
ended January 1, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, The Stanley Works' internal control
over financial reporting.

Within the 90-day period prior to the
filing of this report, under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman and its Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's
Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and its Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material
information relating to the Company (including its consolidated
subsidiaries) required to be included in its periodic Securities
Exchange Commission filings. There have been no significant changes in
the Company's internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation.

EQUITY
COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION

Compensation plans under
which the Company's equity securities are authorized for issuance
at January 1, 2005
follow:

(a)

There
is a non-qualified deferred tax savings plan for highly compensated
salaried employees which mirrors the qualified plan provisions but was
not specifically approved by security holders. U.S. employees are
eligible to contribute from 1% to 15% of their salary to
a tax deferred savings plan as described in the Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP) section of Item 15 Note M Employee Benefit Plans
to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. The Company
contributes an amount equal to one-half of the employee contribution up
to the first 7% of their salary, of which fifty-percent is
invested in Stanley common stock for qualified employees. The
investment of the remaining fifty-percent is controlled by the employee
participating in the plan. The same matching arrangement is provided
for highly compensated salaried employees in the
"non-qualified" plan, except that the
arrangement for these employees is outside of the ESOP, and is not
funded in advance of distributions. Shares of the Company's
common stock may be issued at the time of a distribution from the plan.
The number of securities remaining available for issuance under the
plan at January 1, 2005 is not determinable, since the plan does not
authorize a maximum number of securities.

ITEM
13.    CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

None.


ITEM 14.    PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES
AND SERVICES

The information required by Item 9(e) of
Schedule 14A is incorporated herein by reference to the information set

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareowners
of The Stanley Works

We have audited
management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,
that The Stanley Works maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January 1, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). The Stanley Works' management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of
the company's internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated
in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting; management's assessment of and conclusion on
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not
include the internal controls of ISR Solutions, Inc., a company
acquired in December 2004, which is included in the 2004 consolidated
financial statements of The Stanley Works and constituted total assets
of approximately $50 million at January 1, 2005 and an immaterial
impact on net earnings for the year then ended.

In our
opinion, management's assessment that The Stanley Works'
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
January 1, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, The Stanley Works'
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January 1, 2005 based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Stanley Works and
subsidiaries as of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareowners'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended January 1, 2005 and our report dated February 25, 2005 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareowners
of The Stanley Works

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of The Stanley Works and subsidiaries as of
January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareowners' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
January 1, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of The Stanley Works and
subsidiaries at January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 1, 2005, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness
of The Stanley Work's internal control over financial reporting
as of January 1, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated February 25, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.    SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Presentation

The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries which require consolidation, after the
elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The
Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to December
31. There were 52 weeks in fiscal year 2004, 53 weeks in fiscal year
2003 and 52 weeks in fiscal year 2002.

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as certain financial
statement disclosures. While management believes that the estimates and
assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are
appropriate, actual results could differ from these estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

For foreign operations with
functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability
accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses
are translated using weighted average exchange rates. Resulting
translation adjustments, as well as gains and losses from certain
intercompany transactions, are reported in a separate component of
shareowners' equity. Exchange gains and losses on transactions
are included in earnings, and amounted to net (gains)/losses for 2004,
2003 and 2002 of $ 4.3 million, $(6.2) million and $0.7 million,
respectively.

Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less are
considered cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable

Trade
receivables are stated at gross invoice amount less discounts, other
allowances and provision for uncollectible accounts. The Company had
extended long-term credit to customers to fund the Mac Advantage
financing program and also provided long-term secured financing to Mac
Tools wholesale distributors. However by the end of 2004 both Mac Tools
extended financing programs were outsourced and the majority of the
related portfolios sold, resulting in lower credit risk. The Blick
business offers extended equipment financing leases to its customers,
and credit losses on this lease portfolio are insignificant. Interest
on these loans and leases accrues until they become delinquent,
typically when payments are 120 days past due, at which time they are
written off. Payments received related to these loans and leases
subsequent to being written off are recorded as recoveries to the
allowance for doubtful accounts. The net activity of the Mac Tools
extended financing programs is classified in Other-net in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

The Company estimates its allowance for doubtful
accounts using two methods. First, a specific reserve is established
for individual accounts where information is available that customers
may have an inability to meet financial obligations. Second, a reserve
is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied
to aging categories. These percentages are based on historical
collection and write-off experience. Actual write offs are charged
against the allowance when internal collection efforts have been
unsuccessful, generally when payments are more than 120 days past
due.

Inventories

U.S. inventories, aside from Best,
CST/Berger and certain other small businesses, are valued at the lower
of Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) cost or market. Other inventories are
generally valued at the lower of First-In, First-Out (FIFO) cost or
market.


Property, Plant and Equipment
(PP&E)

The Company generally values PP&E, including
capitalized software, on the basis of historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
provided using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of
the estimated useful life or the term of the lease. Costs related to
maintenance and repairs which do not prolong the assets useful lives
are expensed as incurred. Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived
assets when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted
cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the
assets' carrying amount. The amount of the impairment loss, if
any, is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to
the weighted average discounted cash flows, which consider various
possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets. Primarily as a
result of plant rationalization, certain facilities and equipment are
not currently used in operations, which has resulted in impairment
losses. The following table summarizes the property, plant and
equipment impairment charges by segment and the classification of these
charges within the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

Goodwill, Customer Relationships and
Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents costs in excess of
fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired
businesses. Intangible assets acquired are recorded at cost. Goodwill
and other intangible assets were historically amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. As of January
1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets." Under the provisions of this Statement, goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer
subject to amortization but are tested for impairment annually and at
any time when events suggest impairment may have occurred. The
identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangibles
impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting
units, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about future
cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the goodwill of a
reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
loss would be recognized for the amount of that excess. Intangible
assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful
lives.

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial
instruments are employed to manage risks including foreign currency and
interest rate exposures and are not used for trading or speculative
purposes. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments, such as
interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency options, and foreign
exchange contracts, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically
either in earnings or in shareowners' equity as a component of
other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative
financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether
it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Generally,
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value
hedges are recorded in earnings along with the changes in the fair
value of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk. Gains and
losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent
they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and
subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the
hedged


item when it occurs. In the event the
forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates is no longer
likely, the amount in other comprehensive income is recognized in
earnings and generally the derivative is terminated. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net investment in
foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive income as part
of the cumulative translation adjustment. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and for any portion of a hedge
that is ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest
paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest
expense. Gains resulting from the early termination of interest rate
swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest
expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the
terminated swap.

At times the Company manages exposure to
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions
through the use of forward exchange contracts or currency options. The
Company may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge
intercompany loans and may enter into purchased foreign currency
options to hedge anticipated transactions as it deems appropriate.
Gains and losses on forward exchange contracts are deferred and
subsequently recognized as part of the underlying transactions. Changes
in the fair value of options which represent a basket of foreign
currencies to hedge anticipated cross-currency cash flows are
recognized in cost of sales.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete and the
risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which
generally occurs upon shipment of the finished product but sometimes is
upon delivery to customer facilities.

Certain Security Solutions
businesses sell security related products and automatic doors which
include multiple elements of products and services. Revenues from
multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned,
consistent with the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables". Amounts allocated to each element are based
on objectively determined fair value. Revenues from multiple element
arrangements were less than 10% of consolidated revenues in all
years.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs, classified
in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, are
expensed as incurred and amounted to $28.3 million in 2004, $23.7
million in 2003 and $21.4 million in 2002. Cooperative advertising
expense reported as a deduction in net sales was $21.9 million in 2004,
$22.0 million in 2003 and $18.2 million in 2002.

Income
Taxes

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before
income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary
differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial
reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes, and
are measured by applying enacted tax rates in effect in years in which
the differences are expected to reverse.

Earnings Per
Share

Basic earnings per share equals net earnings divided by
weighted average shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
per share include the impact of common stock equivalents using the
treasury stock method when the effect is dilutive.

Shipping and
Handling Costs

The Company generally does not bill customers
for freight. Shipping and handling costs associated with inbound
freight are reported in cost of sales. Shipping costs associated with
outbound freight are reported as a reduction of net sales and amounted
to $104 million, $94 million and $86 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Distribution costs are classified in SG&A expenses
and amounted to $77 million, $76 million and $64 million in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.


New Accounting Standards

The
adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have
a material impact on the Company's results of operations and
financial condition:

•

Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45,
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
— An Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and
Rescission of FASB Interpretation
No.34";

•

FASB
Interpretation No. 46R, "Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB No.
51";

•

Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 132R (revised 2003),
"Employer's Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Post-Retirement Benefits — An Amendment of FASB Statements No.
87, 88, and 106."

In 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This
Statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as
liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of
the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
This Statement was required to be applied immediately to instruments
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and to all other
instruments that existed as of the beginning of the first interim
financial reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company
had $213 million in notional value Stanley common stock forward
contracts (equity hedges) which were implemented in previous years in
an effort to offset the diluted share count from changes in the stock
price. When the stock price rose, the Company would benefit from the
hedge by partially offsetting the impact of the diluted share count
from in-the-money stock options. These hedges, however, had an opposite
result with a declining stock price. As a risk mitigation initiative
and in conjunction with the new accounting rules under SFAS No. 150,
the Company restructured the $213 million equity hedge contracts. In
April 2003, $100 million of stock was purchased from the equity hedge
counterparties which decreased shares then outstanding by 3.9 million.
These transactions were completed using a combination of borrowings
under existing lines of credit and available cash. No open market
purchase of shares occurred. The remaining $113 million in forward
contracts were modified to full physical settlement contracts with a
fixed notional principal of $113 million and 4.1 million of underlying
shares. These contracts are being settled over four years in equal
quarterly installments and do not contain the same dilution protection
(or risk) as the former contracts. The Company has the right to
repurchase all or part of these shares at a cost of $27.73 per share at
any time during the four year period, plus the interest carried on the
debt less the dividends paid on the shares. As a result of adopting
SFAS No. 150, the remaining notional principal balance, $71 million as
of January 1, 2005 and $99 million as of January 3, 2004, is recognized
as a liability on the balance sheet and the 2.5 and 3.6 million
underlying shares, respectively, are reflected as treasury stock and
excluded from the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted
earnings per share.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
151 "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter
4" (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and
spoilage. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed
production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are
effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS 151 will
not have a material impact on its results of operations and financial
position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153
"Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29" (SFAS 153). SFAS 153 amends the guidance
in APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions" by replacing the exception from fair value
measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets with
an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS
153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of SFAS 153
are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges


occurring in fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS 153 will not
have a material impact on its results of operations and financial
position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123
(revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS
123R), which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation".
SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"
(APB 25), and amends FASB Statement No. 95, "Statement of
Cash Flows".   The approach to quantifying
stock-based compensation expense in SFAS 123R is similar to SFAS 123.
 However, the revised statement requires all share-based payments
to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
based on their fair values as they are earned by the employees under
the vesting terms. Pro forma disclosure of stock-based compensation
expense, as is the Company's practice under SFAS 123, will not be
permitted after the first half of 2005, since  SFAS 123R must be
adopted no later than the first interim or annual period beginning
after June 15, 2005.   The Company expects to follow the
"modified prospective" method of adoption of
SFAS 123R whereby earnings for prior periods will not be restated as
though stock based compensation had been expensed, rather than the
"modified retrospective" method of adoption
which would entail restatements of previously published
earnings.   The Company plans to adopt SFAS 123R on July 3,
2005.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company
currently accounts for share-based compensation to employees under the
APB 25 intrinsic value method and generally recognizes no compensation
cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of the SFAS
123R fair value method will impact the Company's results of
operations, although it will have no impact on overall financial
position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123R will depend on levels of
share-based compensation granted in the future and the fair value
assigned thereto. The future impact of SFAS 123R is likely to
approximate the pro forma compensation expense reported under SFAS 123
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings
per share in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  As
permitted by SFAS 123, the Company uses the actual forfeitures method
whereby pro forma compensation expense is reduced only when options are
forfeited.   Under SFAS 123R, the estimated forfeiture method is
required such that expected future forfeitures will be reflected as a
reduction of stock-based compensation expense.  However, under
SFAS 123R, reduction of compensation expense is not permitted if a
vested share-based payment is later forfeited, as would occur when an
out-of-the money stock option is surrendered by a resigning
employee.   SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as
a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow, but this
will not have a significant impact on the Company's cash flow
reporting.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company
accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees",
as amended by related interpretations of the FASB. Accordingly, no
compensation cost is recognized for stock-based compensation unless the
quoted market price of the stock at the grant date is in excess of the
amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock. Stock-based employee
compensation is discussed further in Note K Capital Stock.


If compensation cost for the
Company's stock-based compensation plans had been determined
based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with the method
prescribed by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation", the Company's net earnings and
earnings per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts
indicated below:

Pro
forma compensation cost relating to the stock options is recognized
over the vesting period. The weighted average vesting periods used for
2004, 2003 and 2002 stock option grants are 2.5 years, 2.9 years and
3.9 years, respectively. The fair value of each stock option grant was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants
in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively: dividend yield of 2.6%,
3.6% and 3.2%; expected volatility of 20%,
25% and 30%; risk-free interest rates of 3.3% in
2004 and 2003 and 3.2% in 2002; and expected lives of 5 years in
2004, 2003 and 2002. The weighted average fair value of stock options
granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $6.76, $5.17 and $7.30,
respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) compensation
cost is recognized in the fourth quarter when the purchase price for
the following fiscal year is established. The fair value of the
employees' purchase rights under the ESPP was estimated using the
following assumptions for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively: dividend
yield of 3.1%, 3.9% and 3.3%; expected volatility
of 20%, 25% and 30%; risk-free interest rates of
2.2%, 1.2% and 1.9%; and expected lives of one
year. The weighted average fair value of those purchase rights granted
in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $7.03, $6.35 and $7.50, respectively.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years' amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In
addition, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have
been reclassified as held for sale in the 2003 Consolidated Balance
Sheet, and the earnings from discontinued operations have been
reclassified within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

B.    ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Trade
receivables are dispersed among a large number of retailers,
distributors and industrial accounts in many countries. Adequate
reserves have been established to cover anticipated credit losses.

The Company has agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, undivided
interests in defined pools of notes receivable to a Qualified Special
Purpose Entity (QSPE). The entity is designed to facilitate the


securitization of certain trade accounts
receivable and is used as an additional source of liquidity. At January
1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, the defined pools of receivables amounted
to $121.8 million and $124.4 million, respectively. The proceeds from
sales of such eligible receivables to the QSPE in revolving-period
securitizations were $21.0 million in 2003, and in 2004 the
securitization was reduced by $42.3 million. There were no gains or
losses on these sales. The amounts deducted from receivables in the
January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 Consolidated Balance Sheets under
this arrangement were $11.7 million and $54.0 million, respectively.
The Company is responsible for servicing and collecting the receivables
sold and held in the QSPE. Any incremental costs related to such
servicing and collection efforts are not significant.

In 2003,
the Company acquired a third party's interest in a second Special
Purpose Entity (SPE) which supported the Mac Tools extended financing
programs. As a result, the entity became non-qualifying and the net
assets, which consisted of notes receivable of $56.4 million at January
3, 2004, were consolidated in the Company's balance sheet. Cash
flows between the Company and the SPE for 2003 totaled $21.0 million,
primarily related to receivable sales, collections on receivables and
servicing fees. There were no gains or losses on the sale of
receivables to the SPE. During 2003, the Company sold a portion of this
receivable portfolio to a third party for $39 million and recognized a
loss on the sale of $6 million. In 2004, the SPE was dissolved and the
majority of the remaining receivable portfolio was sold for $50
million, with a resulting $0.2 million gain.

C.    INVENTORY

Inventories
in the amount of $240.6 million at January 1, 2005 and $237.4 million
at January 3, 2004 were valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. If
the LIFO method had not been used, inventories would have been $58.4
million higher than reported at January 1, 2005, and $46.9 million
higher than reported at January 3, 2004. The LIFO method is utilized in
determining inventory value as it results in better matching of cost
and revenues.

D.    ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

At January
1, 2005, the Company had three properties, valued at $1.4 million,
classified as held for sale related to plant rationalization
activities. These assets represent $0.6 million, $0.7 million and $0.1
million within the Consumer Products, Industrial Tools and Security
Solutions segments, respectively, and consist of real property which is
expected to be disposed of throughout the next year. At January 3,
2004, the Company had four properties held for sale valued at $4.9
million. Two of the properties held for sale at January 3, 2004 were
sold during 2004, and two continue to be held for sale. In addition to
the aforementioned real properties, the net assets of the Residential
Entry Door, Home Décor and German paint roller
("Friess") businesses, which were sold during
2004, are classified as held for sale at January 3, 2004 as detailed in
Note T Discontinued Operations. Assets held for sale are carried at the
lower of fair value or historical cost.

At January 1, 2005,
$42.9 million in financing lease receivables are classified as held for
sale. These receivables, generated by the Blick business within the
Security Solutions segment, were sold on January 5, 2005, and an
insignificant gain will be recognized thereon in fiscal 2005.


E.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND
EQUIPMENT

Depreciation
and amortization expense associated with property, plant and equipment
(inclusive of discontinued operations depreciation and amortization
expense of $2.5 million in 2004, $4.7 million in 2003, and $4.1 million
in 2002) was as follows:

F.    ACQUISITIONS

The Company completed fourteen acquisitions during 2004, 2003 and
2002. These businesses were acquired pursuant to the Company's
growth strategy, including the expansion of the security platform, and
reflecting a deliberate reduction of risk associated with certain large
customer concentrations. With the exception of CST/Berger, which is in
the Industrial Tools segment, all of the significant acquisitions and
most of the smaller ones expanded the Security Solutions segment. The
acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141),
"Business Combinations" and their results are
included in the Company's consolidated operating results from the
respective acquisition dates. All of the acquisitions have resulted in
the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill arises because the purchase price
paid reflects numerous factors including the strategic fit and expected
synergies these targets bring to existing operations, the competitive
nature of the bidding process and the prevailing market value for
comparable companies.

SFAS 141 requires all identifiable assets
and liabilities acquired to be reported at fair value and the excess is
recorded as goodwill. The Company obtains information during due
diligence and from other sources which forms the basis for the initial
allocation of purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets and
liabilities acquired. In the months following an acquisition, the
Company generally obtains independent intangible asset valuation
reports, asset appraisals and other data in order to finalize the fair
values assigned to acquired assets and liabilities.

Integration
of certain acquisitions requires reduction of redundant personnel,
closure of facilities, and other restructuring actions related to the
acquired businesses. In such cases, a restructuring accrual is recorded
for actions identified in integration strategy plans initially
developed by the Company as of the acquisition date, with a resulting
increase to goodwill. As integration strategies are executed, the
Company monitors the previously established restructuring accruals and
makes adjustments to such accruals to the extent actual expenditures
differ from the estimated accruals. Adjustments recorded to previously
established restructuring accruals until the time integration plans are
fully executed, not to exceed one year from date of original
acquisition, are reflected in the final goodwill amount included in the
purchase price allocation. Adjustments made subsequent to the
finalization of integration


strategies, or after one year from the date
of original acquisition, are reflected in the Company's results
of operations. The Company recorded $4.7 million in restructuring
reserves, primarily for severance, in connection with its first quarter
2004 acquisitions. Restructuring reserves pertaining to the 2002 Best
acquisition were $6.4 million, comprised of $5.3 million for severance
and $1.1 million in exit costs primarily for non-cancelable leases. All
but $0.3 million of these acquisition related reserves were expended by
January 1, 2005.

The Company effectively acquired Blick plc
(Blick) on January 20, 2004 by which date 86% of the outstanding
share capital was purchased, and all remaining shares were acquired
shortly thereafter. The final purchase price for Blick was $177
million, and $22 million of this is reflected as current debt since it
is expected to be paid in 2005. Blick is a leading U.K. integrator of
security systems, communication and time management solutions for the
commercial and industrial sectors. On March 9, 2004, the Company
acquired Frisco Bay Industries Ltd. (Frisco Bay) for $39 million. A
small number of Frisco Bay shares remained outstanding at the end of
the first quarter and these shares were all acquired in the second
quarter. Frisco Bay is a leading Canadian provider of security systems
and equipment for financial institutions, government agencies and major
industrial corporations. On January 15, 2004, the Company completed the
acquisition of Chicago Steel Tape Co. and affiliates (CST / Berger) for
$64 million. CST / Berger is a leading designer and manufacturer of
laser and optical leveling and measuring equipment. On December 13,
2004, the Company completed the acquisition of ISR Solutions, Inc.
(ISR), a North American electronic security integrator, and on November
8, 2004, a small automatic door distributor and installer was acquired;
the purchase price for these fourth quarter acquisitions was $42
million.

The total purchase price of $321.7 million for the 2004
acquisitions reflects transaction costs and is net of cash acquired.
Amounts allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
based on estimates of fair value. Adjustments to reflect the fair value
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are substantially
complete for Blick, Frisco Bay and CST/Berger. However the purchase
accounting for the fourth quarter acquisitions is preliminary, mainly
with respect to intangible asset valuations, related deferred taxes,
and fixed asset appraisals. For the 2004 acquisitions, $180.6 million
in goodwill was acquired in the Security Solutions segment and $20.5
million in the Industrial Tools segment.

The following table
summarizes the estimated fair values of major assets acquired and
liabilities assumed for the 2004 acquisitions in the aggregate:

$23
million of the total amount of goodwill associated with the 2004
acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes.


Other Intangible Assets

The
amounts allocated to intangible assets for the 2004 acquisitions are as
follows:

In 2003, the
Company acquired three small businesses at a total cost of $23.4
million. Purchase accounting for all of these acquisitions has been
finalized. The acquisitions did not have a material pro forma impact on
2003 and 2002 operations.

On November 25, 2002, the Company
completed the acquisition of Best Lock Corporation (Best) for $316.0
million. Best is a global provider of security access control systems
and is reported in the Security Solutions segment. In 2003, the Company
made a $0.6 million additional purchase price payment for Best which
was accounted for as an increase to goodwill. The Company finalized its
allocation of the purchase price for Best in 2003 to reflect the final
determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.

Pro Forma Earnings for Significant Acquisitions

The
information for 2004 and 2003 set forth below reflects the pro forma
consolidated results as if the 2004 acquisitions had occurred at the
beginning of 2003. The information for 2002 reflects the pro forma
results as if the Best acquisition had been consummated at the
beginning of that year. Operating results for the acquisitions during
these pre-acquisition periods are not necessarily indicative of future
results. Included in the pro forma 2002 results are $11.0 million in
after-tax restructuring and other nonrecurring charges incurred by Best
in the pre-acquisition period.

G.    GOODWILL,
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

Under SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets", goodwill and intangible assets
with an indefinite life are not amortized. For these assets, SFAS No.
142 requires evaluation for impairment annually or more frequently when
impairment indicators are present. The Company performed the impairment
evaluations in the third quarter each year; none of the evaluations
indicated an impairment loss.


The changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill by segment are as follows:

The
increase in goodwill is mainly a result of 2004 acquisitions. Purchase
accounting for certain 2004 acquisitions is preliminary, primarily with
respect to identification and valuation of intangible assets and
appraisals of fixed assets, and is expected to be finalized by mid
2005. As a result, goodwill may be adjusted.

Other Intangible
Assets

Other intangible assets at January 1, 2005 and January
3, 2004 were as follows:

Aggregate
other intangible assets amortization expense was $23.7 million, $14.0
million and $3.7 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Future
estimated amortization expense is $26.5 million for 2005, $24.0 million
for 2006, $22.5 million for 2007, $20.4 million for 2008 and $16.1
million for 2009.

H.    ACCRUED EXPENSES

Accrued
expenses at January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 follow:


I.    LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCING
ARRANGEMENTS

Long-term debt and financing arrangements at
January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 follow:

In
2004, the Company took advantage of favorable market conditions by
refinancing its 364 day and long term (multi-year) credit arrangements,
creating a long-term credit facility with several U.S. banks to borrow
up to $400.0 million at the lower of prime or money market rates. This
long-term credit facility matures in October 2009. The commitment fee
is 0.07%. In addition, the Company has short-term lines of
credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating $160.6 million, of which
$120.1 million was available at January 1, 2005. Short-term
arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal. Of the aggregate $560.6
million long-term and short-term lines, $400.0 million is available to
support the Company's commercial paper program. The weighted
average interest rates on short-term borrowings at January 1, 2005 and
January 3, 2004 were 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively.

To manage interest costs and foreign exchange risk, the Company
maintains a portfolio of interest rate swap agreements. See Note J
Financial Instruments for more information regarding the
Company's interest rate and currency swap agreements.

Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt for each of the years
from 2005 to 2009 are $55.4 million, $29.3 million, $240.2 million,
$2.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Interest paid during 2004,
2003 and 2002 amounted to $39.0 million, $32.9 million and $25.6
million, respectively.

Included in Short-term borrowings on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004,
are commercial paper and extendible commercial notes utilized to
support working capital requirements, of $12.1 million and zero,
respectively.

In March 2004, the Company repaid $120 million of
long-term debt which matured on March 1, 2004 with commercial paper
borrowings. CST/Berger, Blick, Frisco Bay and ISR were acquired using a
combination of cash on hand, commercial paper borrowings, and proceeds
from the sales of businesses. The company assumed $29 million of debt
in the Blick and Frisco Bay acquisitions. In addition, as of January 1,
2005, the remaining $22.8 million Blick purchase obligation is
reflected in the current portion of long-term debt.

In June
2003, $113.0 million in the Company's common stock equity hedge
forward contracts were modified to full physical settlement contracts
with a fixed notional principal of $113.0 million and 4.1 million of
underlying shares. These contracts are being settled with required cash
payments over four years in equal quarterly installments. As a result
of adopting SFAS No. 150, the remaining notional principal balance of
$70.6 and $98.9 million as of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004,
respectively, has been recognized as debt on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and the 2.5 million and 3.6 million underlying shares,
respectively, are excluded from the number of shares used to calculate
basic and


diluted earnings per share. The $70.6
million liability represents the amount that would be paid if
settlement were to occur as of January 1, 2005. Changes in the value of
the shares of the Company's common stock have no effect on any
future settlement amounts.

J.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company's objectives in using debt related financial
instruments are to obtain the lowest cost source of funds within a
targeted range of variable to fixed-rate debt proportions and to
minimize the foreign exchange risk of obligations. To meet these risk
management objectives, the Company enters into interest rate swap and
currency swap agreements. The Company does not use derivative
instruments for speculative purposes. The Company recognizes
derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and
applies hedge accounting based on the criteria specified in SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" whereby management designates its derivative
instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment
hedges.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses purchased
currency options and forward exchange contracts to reduce exchange
risks arising from cross-border cash flows expected to occur over the
next one year period. In addition, the Company enters into forward
exchange contracts to hedge inter-company activity. The objective of
these practices is to minimize the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on operating results.

At January 1, 2005 and
January 3, 2004, forward contracts hedging inter-company sales and
purchases totaled $78.6 million and $11.2 million, respectively. At
January 3, 2004, currency options hedged anticipated transactions
totaling $118.0 million. The forward contracts and options are
denominated in Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Taiwanese dollars,
Japanese Yen, Thailand Baht, Great Britain Pound, Israeli Shekels,
Polish Zloty, Euro, Danish Krone, New Zealand dollars, South African
Rand, Swiss Franc and Swedish Krona, and generally mature within the
next one year period. The $0.1 million fair value of these derivative
instruments is recorded in Other Assets and Other Liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In March 2004, the Company entered
into a cross currency interest rate swap, to better match the cash
flows related to its Canadian inter-company note receivable with its
cash flows from operations. The Company swapped a Canadian dollar fixed
rate asset resulting from the financing of the Frisco Bay acquisition
into a United States dollar fixed rate asset with a United States
dollar notional value of $25.2 million, and a maturity date of March
2009. At January 1, 2005, the fair value of this currency swap was a
loss of $3.7 million as reflected in Other Liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For derivative instruments that are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the
effective portions of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in
accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of
shareowners' equity and subsequently reclassifies these amounts
into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is
recognized in earnings. The Company immediately reports the ineffective
portion of the gain or loss, if any, in Other-net in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The gains and losses recorded on these
transactions are not material to the Company's Consolidated
Financial Statements. The $7.2 million reported for cash flow hedge
effectiveness in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be
reclassified to earnings when the hedged transactions occur in the
years 2009 through 2014. The ultimate amount recognized will vary based
on fluctuations of the hedged currencies (Euro, Great Britain Pound and
Canadian dollar) through the maturity dates. During 2004 and 2003, no
cash flow hedges were discontinued for which it was probable that a
forecasted transaction would not occur.

Fair Value Hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair
value hedges, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item,
in earnings in the current period.


In February 2004, the Company entered
into two cross currency interest rate swaps, to better match the cash
flows related to its inter-company notes receivable with its cash flows
from operations. The Company swapped a Great Britain pound floating
rate asset resulting from the financing of the Blick acquisition into a
United States dollar floating rate asset with a notional value of $83.6
million, and a Euro floating rate asset which also arose from the Blick
acquisition into a United States dollar floating rate asset with a
notional value of $39.1 million. Both the Great Britain Pound and Euro
swaps are scheduled to mature in January 2009. At January 1, 2005, the
fair value of these currency swaps was a loss of $8.4 million as
reflected in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Company terminated two interest rate swap arrangements in March
2004. These interest rate swaps were fixed to floating rate
arrangements and the notional values were $75 million and $100 million
with termination dates of November 2007 and November 2012,
respectively. They were fair value hedges for a portion of the $150
million five year and $200 million ten year notes issued in November
2002. These swaps were executed to manage the cost of funds through an
optimal mix of variable to fixed rate debt. The effect of the
termination of these swaps amounted to a $0.3 million gain which will
be amortized over the remaining lives of the five year and ten year
notes issued in November 2002.

In December 2003, the Company
entered into a currency option denominated in the Great Britain Pound
in order to mitigate the currency exposure related to the acquisition
of Blick. These options had a notional value of 48.3 million Great
Britain Pounds representing approximately half the purchase price of
Blick and expired on January 28, 2004. The fair value of this option
was $1.5 million on January 3, 2004 and is reflected as a gain in
Other-net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2003. The
Company recorded an additional $0.4 million gain on the expiration of
this option in 2004 in Other-net in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

The Company entered into two additional interest
rate swap arrangements in June and October 2003 with notional values of
$60 million each. These interest rate swaps were floating to fixed rate
arrangements with a forward start date of March 1, 2004. These swaps
were terminated in November 2003 pursuant to a decision that the
Company would not refinance the $120 million of debt maturing in March
2004. The gain associated with the swap terminations totaled $2.8
million and is recorded in Other-net in the 2004 Consolidated Statement
of Operations. The $120 million of debt was repaid in 2004.

Net
Investment Hedge

The Company utilizes net investment hedges to
offset the translation adjustment arising from remeasuring the
Company's investment in the assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses of its foreign subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that
are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the Company
records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument in currency translation adjustment as a separate component
of shareowners' equity. In February 2004, the Company entered
into a cross currency interest rate swap with a United States dollar
notional value of $45.4 million to hedge its net investment in Great
Britain Pound assets. The Company pays Great Britain pounds and
receives United States dollars using fixed interest rates, offsetting
the translation adjustment of its net investment in Great Britain Pound
assets. This swap has a maturity date of February 2014. At January 1,
2005, the fair value of this currency swap was a loss of $3.9 million
and is recorded in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
and the loss/gain on the net investment hedge included in currency
translation adjustment was $3.6 million.

Hedge
Effectiveness

For foreign currency options and forward
contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, the Company
measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the
hedge contract with the cumulative change in the hedged item, both of
which are based on forward rates. Any ineffective portion of the hedge
is recognized in earnings immediately.

For interest rate swaps
designated as cash flow hedges, the Company measures the hedging
effectiveness by offsetting the change in the variable portion of the
interest rate swap with the change in the expected interest flows due
to fluctuations in the LIBOR based interest rate.


Hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial for
2004, 2003 and 2002.

The counterparties to these interest rate
and currency financial instruments are major international financial
institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk for net exchanges
under these agreements, but not for the notional amounts. The risk of
default is considered remote.

The carrying values and fair
values of the Company's financial instruments at January 1, 2005
and January 3, 2004 follow:

Generally,
the carrying value of the debt related financial instruments is
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in long-term debt. The fair
values of long-term debt instruments are estimated using discounted
cash flow analysis, based on the Company's marginal borrowing
rates. The fair values of foreign currency and interest rate swap
agreements are based on current settlement values. The carrying amount
of cash equivalents and short-term borrowings approximates fair
value.

Common stock share activity for 2004, 2003
and 2002 was as follows:

Common
Stock Equity Hedge

The Company previously entered into equity
hedges, in the form of equity forwards on its common shares, to offset
the dilutive effect of in-the-money stock options on earnings per share
and to reduce


potential cash outflow for the repurchase of
the Company's stock to offset stock option exercises. Under the
equity hedge contracts, when the price of the Company's common
stock appreciated since the last quarterly interim settlement, the
Company received its common shares from the counterparties. When the
price of the Company stock depreciated since the last quarterly interim
settlement, the Company delivered its common stock from treasury shares
to the counterparties. Interim quarterly settlements were in shares of
common stock, not cash, and were accounted for within equity. As of
December 28, 2002 the equity hedge contracts had a $213 million
notional value with 6.1 million underlying shares. In April 2003, the
Company settled $100 million of the contracts through a cash repurchase
of 3.9 million underlying shares at that time. In June 2003, the
remaining $113 million in the Company's common stock equity hedge
forward contracts were modified to full physical settlement contracts
with a fixed notional principal of $113 million and 4.1 million of
underlying shares as discussed in Note I Long-term Debt and Financing
Arrangements.

Exclusive of final settlement activity in 2003,
aggregate annual settlement activity under the equity hedge was as
follows: 1,896,482 shares of common stock with a market value of $47.2
million ($66.0 million book value) delivered in 2003 and 1,338,708
shares of common stock with a market value of $46.6 million ($41.6
million book value) delivered in 2002. This annual settlement activity
is reflected as issued from treasury in the table of common stock share
activity above.

Common Stock Reserved

Common stock
shares reserved for issuance under various employee and director stock
plans at January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 follows:

Preferred
Stock Purchase Rights

Each outstanding share of common stock
has one half of a share purchase right. Each purchase right may be
exercised to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $220.00, subject
to adjustment. The rights, which do not have voting rights, expire on
March 10, 2006, and may be redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.01
per right at any time prior to the tenth day following the public
announcement that a person has acquired beneficial ownership of
10% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock. In the
event that the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
combination transaction, provision shall be made so that each holder of
a right (other than a holder who is a 10%-or-more shareowner)
shall have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof, that number of
shares of common stock of the surviving Company having a market value
equal to two times the exercise price of the right. Similarly, if
anyone becomes the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the then
outstanding shares of common stock (except pursuant to an offer for all
outstanding shares of common stock which the independent directors have
deemed to be fair and in the best interest of the Company), provision
will be made so that each holder of a right (other than a holder who is
a 10%-or-more shareowner) shall thereafter have the right to
receive, upon exercise thereof, common stock (or, in certain
circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company)
having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the
right. At January 1, 2005 there were 41,203,532 outstanding rights.
There are 250,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock reserved for issuance in connection with the rights.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has stock-based
compensation plans for salaried employees and non-employee directors of
the Company and its affiliates. The plans provide for discretionary
grants of stock options, restricted stock shares and other stock-based
awards. Stock options are granted at the market price of the
Company's stock on the date of grant and have a ten-year term.
Generally, stock option grants vest ratably between one and five years
from the date of grant.


Stock option amounts and weighted-average
exercise prices follows:

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan enables
substantially all employees in the United States, Canada and Belgium to
subscribe at any time to purchase shares of common stock on a monthly
basis at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the shares
on the first day of the plan year ($26.78 per share for fiscal year
2004 purchases) or 85% of the fair market value of the shares on
the last business day of each month. A maximum of 6,000,000 shares are
authorized for subscription. During 2004, 2003 and 2002 shares totaling
118,544, 49,743 and 119,853, respectively, were issued under the plan
at average prices of $26.78, $23.41 and $31.42 per share,
respectively.

Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan

The
Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (LTSIP) provided for the granting of
awards to senior management employees for achieving Company performance
measures. The Plan was administered by the Compensation and
Organization Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of
non-employee directors. Awards were generally payable in shares of
common stock as directed by the Committee. No awards were earned in
2004, 2003 and 2002 as a non-stock based incentive plan was in place.
Shares delivered that had been earned in earlier years amounted to zero
in 2004, 65,180 in 2003, and 16,556 in 2002.

L.    ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

Accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of each
fiscal year was as follows:


M.    EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)

Substantially all U.S. employees may contribute from 1% to
15% of their salary to a tax deferred savings plan. Employees
elect where to invest their own contributions. The Company contributes
an amount equal to one-half of the employee contribution up to the
first 7% of their salary of which fifty percent is automatically
invested in the Company's common stock. The investment of the
remaining fifty percent of the Company match is controlled by the
employees participating in the plan. The amounts in 2004, 2003 and 2002
under this matching arrangement were $7.3 million, $5.3 million and
$5.7 million, respectively.

Also included in the ESOP is a
non-contributory benefit for U.S. salaried and non-union hourly
employees, called the Cornerstone plan. Under this benefit arrangement,
the Company contributes amounts ranging from 3% to 9% of
employee compensation based on age. Approximately 2,000 U.S. employees
receive an additional average 1.5% contribution actuarially
designed to replace the pension benefits curtailed in 2001.
Contributions under the Cornerstone plan were $12.6 million in 2004,
$13.9 million in 2003 and $12.8 million in 2002. Assets of the
Cornerstone defined contribution plan are invested in equity securities
and bonds.

Shares of the Company's common stock held by
the ESOP were purchased with the proceeds of external borrowings in the
1980's and borrowings from the Company in 1991. The external ESOP
borrowings are guaranteed by the Company and are included in long-term
debt. Shareowners' equity reflects a reduction for the internal
and the external borrowings.

Unallocated shares are released
from the trust based on current period debt principal and interest
payments as a percentage of total future debt principal and interest
payments. These released shares along with allocated dividends,
dividends on unallocated shares acquired with the 1991 loan, and shares
purchased on the open market are used to fund employee contributions,
employer contributions and dividends earned on participant account
balances. Dividends on unallocated shares acquired with the 1989 and
prior loan are used only for debt service.

Net ESOP activity
recognized is based on total debt service and share purchase
requirements less employee contributions and dividends on ESOP shares.
The Company's net ESOP activity resulted in expense of $2.2
million in 2004, $9.2 million in 2003, and $0.1 million in 2002. ESOP
expense is affected by the market value of the Company's common
stock on the monthly dates when shares are released. In 2004, the
market value of shares released averaged $43.20 per share. ESOP expense
may vary in the future as the market value of the Company's
common stock fluctuates.

Dividends on ESOP shares, which are
charged to shareowners' equity as declared, were $12.2 million in
2004, $12.4 million in 2003 and $12.6 million in 2002. Interest costs
incurred by the ESOP on external debt for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $0.7
million, $0.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Both allocated
and unallocated ESOP shares are treated as outstanding for purposes of
computing earnings per share. As of January 1, 2005, the number of ESOP
shares allocated to participant accounts was 4,676,915 and the number
of unallocated shares was 6,275,890. The fair value of the unallocated
ESOP shares at January 1, 2005 was $307.5 million.

Pension and
Other Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors pension plans covering
most domestic hourly and executive employees, and approximately 2,900
foreign employees. Benefits are generally based on salary and years of
service, except for collective bargaining employees whose benefits are
based on a stated amount for each year of service.

The Company
recorded an $18.4 million pre-tax gain associated with the final
settlement of the U.S. salaried and non-union hourly pension
obligations in June 2002, which reflects a reduction for excise taxes
and other expenses from the $37.2 million actuarially determined
settlement gain reported in the following pension expense table.


The Company contributes to multi-employer
plans for certain collective bargaining U.S. employees. In addition,
various other defined contribution plans are sponsored worldwide.

The
components of net periodic pension expense (income) are as follows:

The Company provides medical and dental
benefits for certain retired employees in the United States. In
addition, U.S. employees who retire from active service are eligible
for life insurance benefits. Net periodic postretirement benefit
expense was $1.8 million in 2004, $2.0 million in 2003 and $1.5 million
in 2002.


The Company generally uses a November 30
measurement date for its pension plans with plan assets and a December
31 measurement date for other plans. The changes in the pension and
other postretirement benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets as
well as amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are
shown below:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans
was $275.9 million at January 1, 2005 and $212.0 million at January 3,
2004.


Information regarding pension plans in
which accumulated benefit obligations exceed plan assets follows:

Information
regarding pension plans in which projected benefit obligations
(inclusive of anticipated future compensation increases) exceed plan
assets follows:

The
major assumptions used in valuing pension and post-retirement plan
obligations and net costs were as follows:

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined
considering the returns projected for the various asset classes and the
relative weighting for each asset class as reflected in the target
asset allocation below. In addition the Company considers historical
performance, the opinions of outside actuaries and other data in
developing benchmark returns.

Pension Plan Assets

Plan
assets are invested in equity securities, bonds and other fixed income
securities, real estate, money market instruments and insurance
contracts. The Company's weighted-average worldwide actual asset
allocations at January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 by asset category
are as follows:

The
Company's investment strategy for pension plan assets includes
diversification to minimize interest and market risks, and generally
does not involve the use of derivative financial instruments. Plan
assets are rebalanced periodically to maintain target asset
allocations. Maturities of investments are not necessarily related to
the timing of expected future benefit payments, but adequate liquidity
to make immediate and medium term benefit payments is ensured.


Contributions

The Company's
funding policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts
determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and
future benefits in accordance with federal law and other regulations.
The Company expects to contribute approximately $9 million to its
pension plans and $2 million to its other postretirement benefit plan
in 2005.

Expected Future Benefit Payments

Benefit
payments, inclusive of amounts attributable to estimated future
employee service, are expected to be paid as follows over the next 10
years:

These
benefit payments will be funded through a combination of existing plan
assets and amounts to be contributed in the future by the Company.

Health Care Cost Trends And Medicare Prescription Act Of 2003
Impact

The weighted average annual assumed rate of increase in
the per-capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend
rate) is assumed to be 9.5% for 2004, reducing gradually to
6.00% by 2012 and remaining at that level thereafter. A one
percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate
would have the following effects as of January 1, 2005:

In December
2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003 (the Modernization Act) was signed into law. The Modernization
Act introduced a plan sponsor subsidy based on a percentage of a
beneficiary's annual prescription drug benefits, within defined
limits, and the opportunity for a retiree to obtain prescription drug
benefits under Medicare.

Certain employees are covered under
legacy benefit provisions that include prescription drug coverage for
Medicare-eligible retirees. In order to coordinate this coverage with
the Modernization Act, the Company plans to complete a strategic review
of its postretirement plans during the two year transitional period
provided in the Modernization Act. In accordance with FASB Staff
Position FAS 106-1, the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit
cost do not reflect any potential effects of the Modernization Act.
Since the Company has already taken steps to limit its postretirement
medical benefits, any reductions in postretirement benefit costs
resulting from the Modernization Act are not expected to be
material.

N.    OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES

Other
— net is primarily comprised of intangibles amortization expense,
gains and losses on asset dispositions, currency impact, environmental
expense, results from unconsolidated entities, and net expenses related
to the Mac Tools extended financing programs, mainly financing
receivable losses and interest income. Other-net in 2003 includes $9.5
million in charges related to the exit of the Mac Tools retail channel.
Other-net in 2002 includes a nonrecurring pension settlement gain of
$18.4 million and $11.3 million in income from an environmental
settlement with an insurance carrier.

Research and development
costs were $13.4 million, $8.8 million and $9.8 million for the fiscal
years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

O.    RESTRUCTURING
AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the
Company recorded $7.7 million of restructuring and asset impairment
charges — $4.0 million of restructuring costs in connection with
specific personnel actions to streamline/reposition certain
organizations primarily in the Consumer Products and Industrial Tools
segments; and $3.7 million of impairment charges primarily associated
with a 2004 information system strategy decision.


In 2003, the Company recorded $49.1
million in restructuring and asset impairment charges for the Operation
15 initiative. These charges consisted of $12.2 million for severance,
$26.3 million of asset impairments and $10.6 million of other exit
costs related to the exit from the Company's MacDirect retail
channel. The asset impairments generally relate to assets which are
idle mainly as a result of restructuring initiatives and accordingly
their book value has been written down to fair value.

In the
first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded $3.1 million in
restructuring charges for initiatives pertaining to the further
reduction of its cost structure, primarily for severance-related
obligations. As of January 3, 2004, no accrual remained as all of the
severance had been expended.

At January 1, 2005, the
restructuring and asset impairment reserve balance was $5.3 million,
which the Company expects to be fully expended by the end of 2005. A
summary of the Company's restructuring reserve activity for 2004
follows:

Initiatives

Restructuring
and asset impairment charges by segment were as follows:

For
the three years ended January 1, 2005, 21 facilities have been closed
as a result of restructuring initiatives. In 2004, 2003 and 2002,
approximately 160, 1,100 and 1,000 employees have been terminated as a
result of restructuring initiatives, respectively. Severance payments
of $3.7 million, $17.9 million and $26.0 million and other exit
payments of $4.3 million, $9.6 million and $4.4 million were made in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Write-offs of impaired assets were
$10.5 million, $18.3 million and $5.8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Integration of certain acquisitions requires
reduction of redundant personnel, closure of facilities, and other
restructuring actions related to the acquired businesses. In such
cases, a restructuring accrual is recorded for actions identified in
integration strategy plans initially developed by the Company as of the
acquisition date, with a resulting increase to goodwill. As integration
strategies are executed, the Company monitors the previously
established restructuring accruals and makes adjustments to such
accruals to the extent actual expenditures differ from the estimated
accruals. Adjustments recorded to previously established restructuring
accruals until the time integration plans are fully executed, not to
exceed one year from date of original acquisition, are reflected in the
final goodwill amount included in the purchase price allocation.
Adjustments made subsequent to the finalization of integration
strategies, or after one year from the date of original acquisition,
are reflected in the Company's results of operations. The Company
recorded $4.7 million in restructuring reserves, primarily for
severance, in connection with its first quarter 2004 acquisitions.
Restructuring reserves pertaining to


the 2002 Best acquisition were $6.4 million,
comprised of $5.3 million for severance and $1.1 million in exit costs
primarily for non-cancelable leases. All but $0.3 million of these
acquisition related reserves were expended by January 1,
2005.

P.    BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

The
Company reports the following three segments: Consumer Products,
Industrial Tools and Security Solutions. The Consumer Products segment
includes hand tools, consumer mechanic tools and storage units, and
hardware. Industrial Tools is comprised of Mac Tools, Proto mechanic
tools, pneumatic tools, storage systems, specialty tools, assembly
technologies, hydraulic tools and CST/Berger (measuring tools). The
Security Solutions segment includes access technologies, Best Access,
Blick and Frisco Bay; these businesses manufacture and install
automatic doors, and related hardware and products, as well as
mechanical and electronic lock sets and access controls. The
Company's reportable segments are an aggregation of businesses
that have similar products and services, among other factors. The
information below excludes the Residential Entry Door, Home
Décor and German paint roller businesses, which are classified
as discontinued operations as disclosed in Note T Discontinued
Operations, unless otherwise noted.

Business
Segments


The
Company assesses the performance of its reportable business segments
using operating profit, which follows the same accounting policies as
those described in Note A Significant Accounting Policies. Operating
profit excludes interest income, interest expense, other-net, and
income tax expense. In addition, operating profit excludes
restructuring charges and asset impairments. Corporate and shared
expenses are allocated to each segment. Transactions between segments
are not material. Segment assets primarily include accounts receivable,
inventory, other current assets, property, plant and equipment,
intangible assets and other miscellaneous assets. Corporate assets and
unallocated assets are cash, deferred income taxes and certain other
assets. Geographic net sales and long-lived assets are attributed to
the geographic regions based on the geographic location of each Company
subsidiary.

Sales to The Home Depot were approximately
12%, 13% and 14% of consolidated net sales in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, excluding the discontinued
operations businesses discussed in Note T Discontinued Operations.
Inclusive of the Residential Entry Door, Home Décor and German
paint roller business discontinued operations, sales to The Home Depot
represented 13%, 19%, and 21% of consolidated net
sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For 2004, 2003 and 2002 net
sales to this one customer amounted to 25%, 36% and
36% of segment net sales, respectively, for the Consumer
Products segment, 7%, 6% and 6%, respectively, for
the Industrial Tools segment and 3%, 4% and 8%,
respectively, for the Security Solutions segment.

Areas

Q.    INCOME
TAXES

Significant components of the Company's deferred
tax assets and liabilities as of the end of each fiscal year were as
follows:

Valuation
allowances reduced the deferred tax asset attributable to foreign and
state loss carryforwards to the amount that, based upon all available
evidence, is more likely than not to be realized. Reversal of the
valuation allowance is contingent upon the recognition of future
taxable income and capital gains in specific foreign countries and
specific states, or changes in circumstances which cause the
recognition of the benefits to become more likely than not. The foreign
and state loss carryforwards expire in various years beginning in
2005.


The classification of deferred taxes as
of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 is as follows:

Income
tax expense (benefit) attributable to continuing operations consisted
of the following:

Income
taxes paid during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $125.4 million, $11.2
million (net of a $22.1 million U.S. Federal refund) and $120.0
million, respectively. During 2004, the Company had tax holidays with
China and Thailand. Tax holidays resulted in a $3.0 million reduction
in tax expense in 2004, $2.5 million in 2003, and $2.2 million in 2002.
The tax holiday in China was in place through 2004 and the tax holiday
in Thailand is in place until 2010.

The reconciliation of
federal income tax at the statutory federal rate to income tax at the
effective rate for continuing operations is as follows:

The
components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes
consisted of the following:

The
Company's future effective tax rates could be adversely affected
by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where the
statutory rates are lower. The Company is subject to the examination of
its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. The


Company evaluates the likelihood of
unfavorable adjustments arising from the examinations and believes
adequate provisions have been made in the income tax provision.

Undistributed foreign earnings of $324.1 million at January 1, 2005
are considered to be invested indefinitely or will be remitted
substantially free of additional tax. Accordingly, no provision has
been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such
earnings, nor is it practicable to determine the amount of this
liability.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act creates a temporary
incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign earnings by
providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain
dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is
subject to a number of limitations and, at present significant
uncertainty remains with respect to interpretation of numerous
provisions in the Act. As such, the Company is not yet in a position to
decide on whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign
earnings. It is reasonably possible the Company may repatriate some
amount between $0 and $324.1 million, with the related tax liability
ranging from $0 to $42 million. The amount of additional tax expense
accrued would be reduced if some part of the eligible dividend was
attributable to foreign earnings on which a deferred tax liability has
been previously accrued. The Company is awaiting the issuance of
further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical
corrections with respect to certain provisions in the Act prior to
determining the amounts, if any, it will repatriate and expects to be
in a position to finalize its assessment during 2005.

R.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

Commitments

The
Company has noncancelable operating lease agreements, principally
related to facilities, vehicles, machinery and equipment. Minimum
payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $7.1
million due in the future under noncancelable subleases. In addition,
the Company is a party to synthetic leasing programs which qualify as
operating leases, for two of its major distribution centers. Rental
expense, net of sublease income, for operating leases was $38.7 million
in 2004, $43.0 million in 2003 and $33.8 million in 2002.

Outsourcing and other commitments are comprised of: $20.6 million
for outsourcing arrangements, primarily related to information systems
and telecommunications; $9.4 million in marketing obligations; and $3.6
million of cash funding commitments pertaining to the Company's
U.S. ESOP.

The following table includes the future commitments
for lease obligations, outsourcing and other arrangements.

The
Company has numerous assets, predominantly vehicles and equipment,
under a one-year term renewable U.S. master personal property lease.
Residual value obligations under this master lease were $23.5 million
at January 1, 2005 while the fair value of the underlying assets was
approximately $27 million. The U.S. master personal property lease
obligations are not reflected in the future minimum lease payments
since the initial and remaining term does not exceed one year. The
Company routinely exercises various lease renewal options and from time
to time purchases leased assets for fair value at the end of lease
terms.

The Company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for
two of its major distribution centers. The programs qualify as
operating leases for accounting purposes, where only the monthly lease
cost is recorded in earnings and the liability and value of underlying
assets are off-balance sheet. As of January 1, 2005, the estimated fair
value of assets and remaining obligations for these two properties were
$50.2 million and $42.0 million, respectively.


Guarantees

The
Company has guaranteed the residual value arising from its previously
mentioned synthetic lease and U.S. master personal property lease
programs. The lease guarantees aggregate $65.5 million while the fair
value of the underlying assets is estimated at $77.2 million. The
related assets would be available to satisfy the guarantee obligations
and therefore it is unlikely the Company will incur any future loss
associated with these lease guarantees. The Company has issued $26.5
million in standby letters of credit that guarantee future payments
which may be required under certain insurance programs. Shares of the
Company's common stock held by the ESOP were purchased with the
proceeds of external borrowings in the 1980's and borrowings from
the Company in 1991. The external ESOP borrowings are guaranteed by the
Company and are included in long-term debt. Shareowners' equity
reflects a reduction for the internal and external borrowings.

The Company has sold various businesses and properties over many
years and provided standard indemnification to the purchasers with
respect to any unknown liabilities, such as environmental, which may
arise in the future that are attributable to the time of the
Company's ownership. No liabilities have been recorded for these
general indemnifications since there are no identified exposures.

The Company provides product and service warranties which vary
across its businesses. The types of warranties offered generally range
from one year to limited lifetime, while certain products carry no
warranty. Further, the Company incurs discretionary costs to service
its products in connection with product performance issues. Historical
warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty
obligations recognized. Adjustments are recorded to the warranty
liability as new information becomes available.

The changes in
the carrying amount of product and service warranties for the years
ended January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 are as follows:

S.    CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings relating to
environmental issues, employment, product liability and workers'
compensation claims and other matters. The Company periodically reviews
the status of these proceedings with both inside and outside counsel,
as well as an actuary for


risk insurance. Management believes that the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on operations or financial condition taken as a whole.

The Company recognizes liabilities for contingent exposures when
analysis indicates it is both probable that an asset has been impaired
or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of impairment or
loss can reasonably be estimated. When a range of probable loss can be
estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount. In the event
that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely,
the minimum loss in the range is accrued.

In the normal course
of business, the Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims. In
addition, the Company is a party to a number of proceedings before
federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental
remediation. Also, the Company, along with many other companies, has
been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in a number of
administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites,
including ten active Superfund sites. Current laws potentially impose
joint and several liability upon each PRP. In assessing its potential
liability at these sites, the Company has considered the following: the
solvency of the other PRPs, whether responsibility is being disputed,
the terms of existing agreements, experience at similar sites, and the
fact that the Company's volumetric contribution at these sites is
relatively small.

The Company's policy is to accrue
environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded
is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to
each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology,
presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take
into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties.
As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the
amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect
additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As
of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, the Company had reserves of
$13.6 million and $11.5 million, respectively, primarily for
remediation activities associated with Company-owned properties as well
as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. Of
this amount, $3.7 million is classified as current and $9.9 million as
long-term. The range of environmental remediation costs that is
reasonably possible is $13.6 million to $34.7 million which is subject
to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental
remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded
on those sites in accordance with policy.

The environmental
liability for certain sites that have cash payments that are fixed or
reliably determinable have been discounted using a rate in the range of
4.3% to 5.4%, depending on the timing of cash payments.
The discounted and undiscounted amount of the liability relative to
these sites is $5.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively, as of
January 1, 2005 and $6.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively, as of
January 3, 2004. The payments relative to these sites are expected to
be $0.9 million in 2005, $1.7 million in 2006, $1.0 million in 2007,
$0.3 million in 2008, $0.3 million in 2009 and $4.0 million
thereafter.

The amount recorded for identified contingent
liabilities is based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed
periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred in
future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent
uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject to the
imprecision in estimating future contingent liability costs, the
Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection
with these matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a
materially adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

As previously disclosed in the 2002
Annual Report, the Company's audited Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 28, 2002 include $5.6 million,
or 4¢ per fully diluted share, of accounting corrections related
primarily to expense capitalization and depreciation in fiscal years
1999 through 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2003 the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued a formal order of private investigation in
connection with allegations regarding certain accounting matters. These
allegations, which had previously been raised with the Company
anonymously, were initially researched and evaluated by the
Company's management, internal audit staff and independent


auditors, and subsequently, further
investigated by a second multinational accounting firm, all under the
supervision of the audit committee of the Board of Directors. This
resulted in the accounting corrections referred to above. The Company
has cooperated fully with the SEC throughout the investigation.
Management, the Board of Directors and the Company's independent
auditors concluded that such corrections were immaterial, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, to the December 28, 2002 audited
Consolidated Financial Statements and immaterial to the previously
reported results of the prior years and quarters to which they
relate.

T.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On October 15,
2004, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Home
Décor business to Wellspring Capital Management LLC, a New
York-based private equity investment firm. The $87 million cash sale
transaction closed on December 4, 2004 and resulted in an after-tax
gain of $24 million.

In a definitive agreement effective
December 31, 2004, the Company sold Friess, its German paint roller
business, to Nespoli Groupe SpA for $6.4 million, and an unfavorable
loss of $3.6 million was recognized thereon.

On December 8,
2003, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its
Residential Entry Door business to Masonite International Corporation.
The $161 million cash sale transaction closed on March 2, 2004 and
resulted in an after-tax gain of $95 million.

In accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the results
of operations of the Home Décor, Friess and Residential Entry
Door businesses for the current and prior periods have been reported as
discontinued operations. In addition the assets and liabilities of the
Home Décor, Friess and Residential Entry Door businesses have
been reclassified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
January 3, 2004. The divestures of these businesses were made pursuant
to the Company's growth strategy which entails a reduction of
risk associated with certain large customer concentrations.

The
Home Décor business supplied mirrored closet doors, closet
organization products and wall décor products primarily through
large retailers in North America and Europe. The Friess business
manufactured paint rollers in Germany and sold them into the private
label market in continental Europe. The Residential Entry Door business
manufactured and distributed steel and fiberglass entry doors and
components throughout North America. Operating results of the Home
Décor, Friess and Residential Entry Door businesses, which were
formerly included in the Consumer Products segment, are summarized as
follows:

The
Home Décor, Friess and the Residential Entry Door businesses
sales to The Home Depot amounted to 28% of their net sales in
2004 and 63% in 2003 and 67% in 2002.


Assets and liabilities of the Home
Décor, Friess and Residential Entry Door businesses as of
January 3, 2004 are as follows:

Goodwill
disposed of in these 2004 divestitures amounted to $14.1 million.

Quarterly Results of Operations (unaudited)

**

Changes
in previously reported Net sales, Gross profit and Selling, general and
administrative expenses are due to the reclassification of amounts
related to the discontinued operations of the Residential Entry Door,
Home Décor and Friess businesses as described in Note T
Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
