Our
      Business

GPU
      Business

The
      combination of the programmable GPU with Microsoft’s, DirectX 9.0 high-level
      shading language is known as DirectX 9.0 GPUs. The flexibility and power of
      DirectX 9 GPUs can enhance high-definition, or HD, digital video, image
      processing and editing for digital photographs, as well as bring a “cinematic
      look” to computer graphics. Technology and market leadership in this generation
      of GPUs continues to be a key element of our corporate strategy. The successful
      production launch of our GeForce 6800 and 6600 GPU series in fiscal 2005 led
      to
      our increase in market share from 21% to 67% of the Performance DirectX
      9.0-compatible graphics controller segment, according to

the
      Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2003 and 2004 PC Graphics Reports,
      respectively

.
      In
      fiscal 2006, our strategy was to extend our architectural and technology
      advantage by leading the industry with our second-generation GPU to support
      DirectX 9 Shader Model 3.0 - the GeForce 7800 GPU. By successfully extending
      our
      leadership position in the performance segment with the production release
      of
      the GeForce 7800 in June 2005, we grew our market share from 67% to 79%,
      according to

the
      Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2004 and 2005 PC Graphics Reports,
      respectively

.
      In
      January 2006, we launched and initiated sales of the GeForce 7300 GPU, our
      first
      mainstream version of the GeForce 7 Series. The GeForce 6 and 7 Series desktop
      and notebook GPUs are designed to be compatible with Microsoft’s next generation
      operating system, Microsoft Windows Vista, or Vista, which is scheduled to
      be
      released in the second half of calendar 2006. Vista is expected to mark a
      dramatic improvement in the way the Windows operating system takes advantage
      of
      the PC’s GPU to provide a positive user experience.

The
      NVIDIA Quadro brand has become the benchmark of performance and compatibility
      for the professional industry.  During fiscal 2006, the growth in our
      Quadro professional workstation products was a reflection of the digital
      revolution sweeping nearly every industry, from industrial design, to industrial
      styling, to film, to HD broadcast, to medical imaging and many more. In the
      future, we expect the growth of our professional workstation products to be
      influenced by the demand for HD content creation, HD video editing and HD
      broadcast.


MCP
      Business

The
      NVIDIA nForce family of products represents our MCPs for Advanced Micro Devices,
      Inc., or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel,-based desktop, notebook,
      professional workstations and servers. Our strategy for MCPs aligns with what
      we
      anticipate will drive growth such as multi-core, ever-increasing-speed
      networking and storage technologies, and integration of complex features such
      as
      virtualization, security processing, network processing and more. The In-Stat
      Trendy Chipset for the x86 Processor Report projects strong growth for PC
      chipsets through the end of this decade: from $7.6 billion in 2006 to over
      $10
      billion in 2009.

In
      September 2005, we introduced our first integrated graphics core logic solutions
      in more than two years, the GeForce 6100 Series GPU and NVIDIA nForce 400 Series
      MCP. We offer the industry’s first and only integrated core logic to feature
      DirectX 9.0 and Shader Model 3.0 technology.

We
      also
      offer PureVideo technology, a HD video processor designed to deliver a home
      theater-quality movie watching experience on PCs and media centers. NVIDIA
      is
      now the third largest core logic supplier in the world, according to

the
      Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2005 PC Graphics Report

.
      We are
      the largest supplier of AMD 64 chipsets with 38% segment share. NVIDIA nForce
      MCP unit shipments for AMD64-based CPUs increased over 510% year-over year,
      based on

the
      Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2005 PC Processor Forecast Report

.

Handheld
      GPU Business

Our
      strategy in our Handheld GPU Business is to lead innovation and capitalize
      on
      the emergence of the cellular phone as a versatile consumer lifestyle
      device.

The
      hallmark of every device

in the
      NVIDIA GoForce product family is to provide a high-performance, visually rich
      multimedia experience on cellular phones and handheld devices. These products
      deliver an advanced visual experience by accelerating graphics and video

      life. These technologies enhance visual display capabilities, improve
      connectivity, and minimize chip and system-level power consumption. GoForce
      products can be found in advanced multimedia cellular phones, PDAs, and other
      handheld devices.

Consumer
      Electronics Business

Our
      Consumer Electronics Business is composed of our contractual arrangements
      with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation
      GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s PlayStation3, sales of our
      Xbox-related products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft
      relating to the successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the
      Xbox360, and related devices, and digital media processor products.

During
      the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Microsoft indicated that it would not order
      any more Xbox-related products from us after our second fiscal quarter. As
      a
      result, the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was the last quarter during which
      we
      recognized revenue from the sale of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft.

      mainstream segment with the release of our GeForce 6600 GPU. In August 2005,
      we
      announced that the NVIDIA nForce4 SLI X16 Intel Edition technology featured
      in
      the Dell Dimension XPS 600 desktop PC was immediately available. In September
      2005, we introduced our first motherboard graphics solutions in more than two
      years, the GeForce 6100 Series GPU and NVIDIA nForce 400 Series MCP. We offer
      the industry’s first and only integrated core logic to feature DirectX 9.0 and
      Shader Model 3.0 technology. In January 2006, we announced two new MCPs for
      the
      Intel platform, the NVIDIA nForce4 SLI XE and NVIDIA nForce4 Ultra, both of
      which provide the system-builder and do-it-yourself communities with two new
      lower cost discrete motherboard solutions for Intel PC platforms.

Handheld
      GPUs

.

Our
      Handheld GPU product family, known as GoForce, supports handheld personal
      digital assistants, or PDAs, and multimedia cellular phones.

GoForce.

The
      GoForce family represents our handheld GPUs for a wide range of multimedia
      cellular phones and handheld devices. The GoForce 2100 and GoForce 2150 GPUs
      are
      two of the first handheld GPUs to offer hardware acceleration engines for 2D
      graphics to manufacturers that support liquid crystal display, or LCD, screen
      resolutions up to 320 x 240 pixels. The GoForce 3000 and GoForce 4000 offer
      a
      host of advanced features for cellular phones and PDAs, including support for
      up
      to 3-megapixel image capture, accelerated graphics for gaming, and motion Joint
      Photographic Experts Group, or JPEG, capture and playback. Our
      GoForce 4000, GoForce 4500 and GoForce 4800 handheld GPUs are the first to
      provide programmable 3D shaders, along with high-quality multi-megapixel still
      image and video processing in a single-chip package. Using dedicated hardware
      accelerator engines, the GoForce family delivers high performance multimedia
      applications and drives high-resolution displays, while extending handheld
      battery life through a variety of unique power management techniques. In the
      third quarter of fiscal 2006, Motorola Inc. and Sony Ericsson Mobile
      Communications AB launched Third Generation, or 3G, models of their RAZR and
      Walkman portable phones, respectively, that are both powered by our GoForce
      GPUs.

Consumer
      Electronics.

Our
      Consumer Electronics product group is concentrated in products that support
      video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices.

Playstation3.

In April
      2005, we finalized our definitive agreement with SCE to jointly develop a custom
      GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in
      SCE’s PlayStation3.  In addition, we are licensing software development
      tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities to SCE. We
      have successfully reached many development milestones and we believe that we
      are
      on target to achieve the goals set by SCE under this agreement.

Xbox.

Our
      Xbox
      platform processor supported Microsoft’s initial Xbox video game
      console.

The
      Xbox
      platform processor featured dual-processing architecture, which included our
      GPU
      designed specifically for the Xbox, or XGPU, and our MCP to power the Xbox’s
      graphics, audio and networking capabilities.  We also have a license
      agreement with Microsoft relating to the successor product to their initial
      Xbox
      gaming console, the Xbox360, and related devices. During the first quarter
      of
      fiscal 2006, Microsoft indicated that it would not order any more Xbox-related
      products from us after our second fiscal quarter. As a result, the second
      quarter of fiscal 2006 was the last quarter during which we recognized revenue
      from the sale of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft.

Our
      Strategy

We
      design
      our GPUs, MCPs and handheld GPUs to enable our PC OEMs, ODMs, system builders,

      in
      the processing and transmission of high-bandwidth digital media to develop
      products designed to address the requirements of high-bandwidth concurrent
      multimedia.

Use
      our Intellectual Property and Resources to Enter into License and Development
      Contracts.

During
      fiscal 2006, we entered into license arrangements that require significant
      customization of our intellectual property components and we anticipate that
      we
      will enter into additional agreements during fiscal 2007.

For
      license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual
      property components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the
      percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services
      are
      performed.

For
      example, in April 2005, we finalized our definitive agreement with SCE to
      jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU
      and
      SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s PlayStation3.  Our collaboration with SCE
      includes license fees and royalties for the PlayStation3 and all derivatives,
      including next-generation digital consumer electronics devices.  In
      addition, we are licensing software development tools for creating shaders
      and
      advanced graphics capabilities to SCE.


Sales
      and Marketing

Our
      worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become
      the leading supplier of performance GPUs, MCPs, and handheld GPUs for PCs,
      handheld devices and consumer electronics platforms. Our sales and marketing
      teams work closely with each industry’s respective OEMs, ODMs, system
      integrators, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and industry
      trendsetters, collectively our channel, to define product features, performance,
      price and timing of new products. Members of our sales team have a high level
      of
      technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support a competitive
      and complex design win process. We also employ a highly skilled team of
      application engineers to assist the channel in designing, testing and qualifying
      system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that the depth and
      quality of our design support are key to improving the channel’s time-to-market,
      maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the channel and
      fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation
      of
      our products.

In
      the
      GPU, MCP, and handheld GPU segments we serve, the sales process involves
      achieving key design wins with leading OEMs and major system integrators and
      supporting the product design into high volume production with key ODMs,
      motherboard manufacturers and add-in board manufacturers. These design wins
      in
      turn influence the retail and system integrator channel that is serviced by
      add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to
      work
      with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs,
      ODMs, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and distributors
      each of which has relationships with a broad range of major OEMs and/or strong
      brand name recognition in the retail channel. In the handheld GPU segments
      we
      serve, the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly
      with the leading handheld OEMs and supporting the product design into
      high-volume production. Currently, we sell a significant portion of our digital
      media processors directly to distributors, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers
      and add-in board manufacturers, which then sell boards and systems with our
      products to leading OEMs, retail outlets and to a large number of system
      integrators. Although a small number of our customers represent the majority
      of
      our revenue, their end customers include a large number of OEMs and system
      integrators throughout the world.

As
      a
      result of our channel strategy, our sales are focused on a small number of
      customers. Sales to Edom Technology Co., Ltd., or Edom, accounted for 14% and
      sales to Asustek Computer Inc., or Asustek, accounted for 12% of our total
      revenue for fiscal 2006. Edom is an independent distributor and Asustek is
      a
      CEM.

To
      encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized
      for platforms utilizing our products, we seek to establish and maintain strong
      relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing
      personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss
      our products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical
      problems. Our developer program makes products available to developers prior
      to
      volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles
      that are optimized for our products.

Backlog

Our
      sales
      are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of
      products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject
      to
      revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in
      manufacturing availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by
      short
      lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice
      and
      experience, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is
      non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable
      portion is not significant. We do not believe that a backlog as of any
      particular date is indicative of future results.

Seasonality

Our
      industry is largely focused on the consumer products market. Due to the
      seasonality in this market, we typically expect to see stronger revenue
      performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the
      back-to-school and holiday seasons.


Manufacturing

We
      do not
      directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead we
      utilize what is known as a “fabless” manufacturing strategy for all product-line
      operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of
      the
      manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and
      packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that
      are certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO,
      in
      such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability
      and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the
      significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing
      operations. Our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the
      raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus
      our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and
      customer support.

We
      utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Chartered Semiconductor
      Manufacturing, or Chartered, Semiconductor Manufacturing International
      Corporation, or SMIC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC,
      and United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, to produce our semiconductor
      wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced
      Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, Amkor Technology, King Yuan Electronics
      Co.,
      LTD, or KYEC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., or SPIL, and STATS
      ChipPAC Incorporated to perform assembly, testing and packaging of most of
      our
      products.

We
      typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform
      incoming quality assurance and then ship them to CEMs, distributors, motherboard
      and add-in board manufacturer customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong
      Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on
      our
      design kit and test specifications, and then ship the products to retailers,
      system integrators or OEMs as motherboard and add-in board solutions.

Inventory
      and Working Capital

Our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and
      other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating
      with
      our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on
      a
      product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products
      that are based on this forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually
      purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to
      revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in
      manufacturing availability. We generally maintain substantial inventories of
      our
      products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead
      time
      orders and quick delivery schedules.

Research
      and Development

We
      believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed
      to
      deliver leading 3D graphics, HD video, audio, low power communications, storage,
      and secure networking performance and features is essential to our future
      success. Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently
      developing multiple generations of GPUs, MCPs and Handheld GPUs using
      independent design teams. Our research and development efforts are performed
      within specialized groups consisting of software engineering, hardware
      engineering, very large scale integration design engineering, process
      engineering, architecture and algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline
      designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations
      of products.

A
      critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with
      leaders in the computer aided design, or CAD, industry. We invest significant
      resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders, including
      Cadence Design Systems, Inc., and Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these
      companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that
      forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools
      to
      design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront
      of
      the 3D graphics market and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology
      on a rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design
      schedules of PC OEM and other manufacturers.


We
      have
      substantially increased our engineering and technical resources from fiscal
      2005, and have 1,654 full-time employees engaged in research and development
      as
      of January 29, 2006, compared to 1,231 employees as of January 30, 2005. During
      fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we incurred research and development expenditures
      of
      $352.1 million, $335.1 million and $270.0 million, respectively.

Competition

The
      market for GPUs, MCPs and handheld GPUs is intensely competitive and is
      characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and
      declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive
      factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access
      to
      customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support,
      conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces, or APIs,
      manufacturing capabilities, price of processors and total system costs of add-in
      boards or motherboards. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will
      depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that
      customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes
      of
      our products at acceptable levels of quality. We expect competition to increase
      both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may
      be
      less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features
      not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors
      or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market
      share.

An
      additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide
      or
      intend to provide GPU, MCP, and Handheld GPU solutions. Some of our competitors
      may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources
      than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.
      Our current competitors include the following:

·

suppliers
                of discrete MCPs that incorporate a combination of networking, audio,
                communications and input/output, or I/O, functionality as part of
                their
                existing solutions, such as ATI Technologies, Inc., or ATI, Broadcom
                Corporation, or Broadcom, and
                Intel;

·

suppliers
                of GPUs, including MCPs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality
                as part
                of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Intel, Matrox Electronics
                Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems, Inc., VIA Technologies,
                Inc.,
                and XGI Technology Inc.; and

·

suppliers
                of GPUs or GPU intellectual property for handheld and embedded devices
                that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their
                existing
                solutions, such as ATI, Bitboys, Broadcom, Fujitsu Limited, Imagination
                Technologies Ltd., NEC Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas
                Technology Corp., Seiko-Epson, Texas Instruments Incorporated, and
                Toshiba
                America, Inc.

We
      expect
      substantial competition from Intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling
      platform solutions dominated by Intel products, such as when Intel achieved
      success with its Centrino platform solution. In addition to its current Centrino
      notebook platform initiative, and its announced upcoming desktop initiative
      branded as VIIV, we expect that Intel is now focused on developing and selling
      platform solutions for all segments including professional workstations and
      servers. If Intel continues to pursue these initiatives, we may not be able
      to
      successfully compete in these segments.

If
      and to
      the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise PC,
      notebook, workstation, PDA, cellular phone, and video game console markets,
      we
      may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from
      companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately predict
      if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. If we are
      unable to compete in our current and any new markets, our financial results
      will
      suffer.

Patents
      and Proprietary Rights

We
      rely
      primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee
      and
      third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect
      our
      intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our issued
      patents have expiration dates from September 4, 2007 to September 2, 2024.
      We
      have numerous patents issued and pending in the United States and in foreign
      countries. Our patents and pending patent


applications
      relate to technology used by us in connection with our products, including
      our
      digital media processors. We also rely on international treaties and
      organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. We
      continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular
      innovations and technologies based on such factors as: the commercial
      significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular
      countries and regions; the location in which our products are manufactured;
      our
      strategic technology or product directions in different countries; and the
      degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced
      in different jurisdictions.

Our
      pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved.
      In
      addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages
      or
      may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may
      harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop
      substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to
      our
      trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect
      our
      intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology
      from
      third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors, and expect
      to
      continue to enter into license agreements for future products. These licenses
      may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of
      technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are
      not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer.

Employees

As
      of
      January 29, 2006 we had 2,737 employees, 1,654 of whom were engaged in research
      and development and 1,083 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations
      and administrative positions. None of our employees are covered by collective
      bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationships with our employees
      are
      good.

Financial
      Information by Business Segment and Geographic Data

Our
      Chief
      Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker,
      or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis
      for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
      During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we reorganized our operating segments
      to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to position
      ourselves as the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor
      technologies. We now report financial information for four product-line
      operating segments to our CODM: the GPU Business is composed of products that
      support desktop PCs, notebook PCs and professional workstations; the MCP
      Business is composed of NVIDIA nForce products that operate as a single-chip
      or
      chipset that can off-load system functions, such as audio processing and network
      communications, and perform these operations independently from the host CPU;
      our Handheld GPU Business is composed of products that support handheld personal
      digital assistants, cellular phones and other handheld devices; and our Consumer
      Electronics Business is concentrated in products that support video game
      consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices and is composed of
      revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom
      GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in
      SCE’s PlayStation3, revenue from sales of our Xbox-related
      products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft relating to the
      successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the Xbox360, and related
      devices, and digital media processor products. In addition to these operating
      segments, we have the “All Other” category that includes human resources, legal,
      finance, general administration and corporate marketing expenses, which total
      $121.2 million and $101.5 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, that
      we do not allocate to our other operating segments. “All Other” also includes
      the results of operations of other miscellaneous operating segments that are
      neither individually reportable, nor aggregated with another operating segment.
      Revenue in the “All Other” category is primarily derived from sales of
      memory.  All prior period amounts have been restated to reflect our new
      reporting structure.

Our
      CODM
      does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment
      basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly,
      there is none to be reported.  The accounting policies for segment
      reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.  The information included
      in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is hereby
      incorporated by reference.

ITEM
      1A. RISK FACTORS

In
      evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following

factors
      should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report
      on Form 10-K.  Any one of the following risks could seriously harm our
      business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause
      our
      stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
      to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
      operations.

Risks
      Related to Our Operations

Because
      our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors, our failure
      to
      forecast any change in such factors could adversely affect our gross
      margin.

We
      continue to pursue measures in an effort to improve our gross margin. Our
      gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors, including the mix
      of
      our products sold, average selling prices, introduction of new products, sales
      discounts, unexpected pricing actions by our competitors, the cost of product
      components, and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture
      our products. If we incorrectly forecast the impact of the aforementioned
      factors on our business, we may be unable to take action in time to counteract
      any negative impact on our gross margin. In addition, if we are unable to
      meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts,
      the
      trading price of our common stock may decline.

Our
      failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete
      inventory or, conversely, may result in inadequate inventory levels, either
      of
      which could adversely affect our financial results.

Our
      inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts, which may not
      accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers
      will
      want in the future. In forecasting demand, we must make multiple assumptions
      any
      of which may prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or
      obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our
      inventory and/or a forced reduction in average selling prices, and where our
      gross margin could be adversely affected include:

·

if
                there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;

·

if
                there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of
                rapidly
                changing technology and customer requirements;

·

if
                we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older products
                as our
                newer products are introduced; or

·

if
                our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing actions.

Conversely,
      if we underestimate our customers’ demand for either our older or newer
      products, we may have inadequate manufacturing capability and may not be able
      to
      obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis,
      which could affect our revenue results. Even if we are able to increase
      production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a
      cost
      effective manner. Inability to fill our customers' orders on a timely basis
      could damage our customer relationships, result in lost revenue, cause a loss
      in
      market share or damage our reputation.


Because
      we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand our ability to
      reduce our inventory purchase commitments quickly in response to any revenue
      shortfalls is limited.

Substantially
      all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term
      agreements. As a result, we may commit resources to the production of products
      without having received advance purchase commitments from customers. Any
      inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could
      harm our business. In addition, cancellation or deferral of product orders
      could
      result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross
      margin and restrict our ability to fund operations. We may build inventories
      during periods of anticipated growth. Additionally, because we often sell a
      substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter and,
      therefore, we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month
      of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments
      in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls. We could be subject
      to
      excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory
      write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand, which
      could negatively impact our gross margin and financial results.

We
      are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could negatively
      impact our business.

Our
      performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive
      officers and key employees. None of our executive officers or employees is
      bound
      by an employment agreement, meaning our relationships with our executive
      officers and employees are at will. We do not have “key person” life insurance
      policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our
      executive officers, technical personnel or other key employees, particularly
      Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would harm our
      business. Our success will depend on our ability to identify, hire, train and
      retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Our failure to
      attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm
      our business. The integration of new executives or personnel could disrupt
      our
      ongoing operations.

Failure
      to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and/or new products would
      reduce our gross margin and could adversely affect our ability to compete
      effectively.

Semiconductor
      manufacturing yields are a function both of product design, which is developed
      largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the
      manufacturer. Since low yields may result from either design or process
      technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined or
      resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to
      identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used.
      As a
      result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production
      process. Resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication
      between us and the manufacturer.

Because
      of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our
      manufacturers, any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase
      in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply
      among our customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships, our
      reputation, our revenue and our gross profit. Our wafer manufacturers may be
      unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future.
      Our
      inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers would reduce
      our gross margin. We also face the risk of product recalls or product returns
      resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during
      the manufacturing and testing process. A significant number of product returns
      due to a defect or recall could damage our reputation and result in our
      customers working with our competitors.

To
      stay competitive, we may have to invest more resources in research and
      development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and
      negatively impact our operating results.

If
      new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other
      competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than
      anticipated in research and development efforts, our operating expenses would
      increase. We have substantially increased our engineering and technical
      resources and have 1,654 full-time employees engaged in research and development
      as of January 29, 2006, 1,231 employees as of January 30, 2005 and 1,057
      employees as of January 25, 2004. Research and development expenditures were
      $352.1 million, $335.1 million, and $270.0 million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and
      2004, respectively. If we are required to invest significantly greater


resources
      than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in
      revenue, our operating results would decline. In order to remain competitive,
      we
      anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research
      and
      development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in
      the
      foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of
      products under development as well as hiring additional employees. Research
      and
      development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent
      we
      make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these
      investments may be independent of our level of revenue.

Our
      operating expenses are relatively fixed and we may have limited ability to
      reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls.

Our
      operating expenses, which are comprised of research and development expenses
      and
      sales, general and administrative expenses, represented 24.0% and 26.7% of
      our
      total revenue during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating expenses
      included litigation settlement costs of $14.2 million in fiscal 2006. Since
      we
      often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each
      quarter, we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner
      in response to any revenue shortfalls. If we are unable to reduce operating
      expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls, our financial results
      would be negatively impacted.

Failure
      to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could adversely affect
      our operating results and gross margin.

Our
      strategy is to utilize the most advanced manufacturing process technology
      appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-party
      foundries. Use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield
      problems and higher product cost. Manufacturing process technologies are subject
      to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and
      development. We continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller
      geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs.
      We currently use 0.15 micron, 0.14 micron, 0.13 micron, 0.11 micron, and 90
      nanometer process technologies for our families of GPUs, MCPs and Handheld
      GPUs.

We
      have
      experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past
      and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries
      and increased expense levels. We may face similar difficulties, delays and
      expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry
      processes. Moreover, we are dependent on our relationships with our third-party
      manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully. The
      inability by us or our third-party manufacturers to effectively and efficiently
      transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our
      operating results and our gross margin.

Our
      operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating
      results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the
      trading price of our stock could decline.

Many
      of
      our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict, and our operating
      expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period. It is,
      therefore, difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or
      losses. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results
      could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which
      could
      cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially.
      We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue
      to
      be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue, gross profit
      and results of operations.

Any
      one or more of the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or
      other
      factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net
      income. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results
      of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
      In addition, the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not
      necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or
      a
      full fiscal year.


Risks
      Related to Our Products

If
      we are unable to achieve design wins, our products may not be adopted by our
      target markets and customers either of which could negatively impact our
      financial results.

The
      future success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability
      to
      develop new competitive products for our target markets and customers. We
      believe achieving design wins, which entails having our existing and future
      products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by PC OEMs,
      ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, will aid our future
      success. Our OEM, ODM, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ customers
      typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year,
      typically based on spring and fall design cycles. Accordingly, when our
      customers are making their design decisions, our existing products must have
      competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in
      order
      to be included in new system configurations. This requires that we do the
      following:

·

anticipate
                the features and functionality that customers and consumers will
                demand;

·

incorporate
                those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting
                design requirements of OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard
                manufacturers;

·

price
                our products competitively; and

·

introduce
                products to the market within the limited design cycle for OEMs,
                ODMs, and
                add-in board and motherboard manufacturers.

If
      OEMs,
      ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products
      in their systems, they will typically not use our products in their design
      systems until at least the next design configuration. Therefore, we endeavor
      to
      develop close relationships with our OEMs and ODMs in an attempt to allow us
      to
      better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that our
      products will achieve design wins.

Our
      ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify
      and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated changes
      in
      industry standards could render our products incompatible with products
      developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers, including
      AMD, Intel and Microsoft. Such changes would require us to invest significant
      time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant
      standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry
      standards for a significant period of time, our ability to achieve design wins
      could suffer. If we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new
      customers, we may lose market share and our operating results would be
      negatively impacted.

Achievement
      of design wins may not result in the success of our products and could result
      in
      a loss of market share.

The
      process of being qualified for inclusion in an OEM product can be lengthy and
      could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular
      product feature, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm
      our
      business. Even if we do have design wins for OEM and ODM products, we may not
      be
      able to successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes
      within the appropriate time to meet both the OEM, ODM, add-in board and
      motherboard manufacturers’ design cycles as well as other market demand.
      Additionally, even if we achieve a significant number of design wins, there
      can
      be no assurance that our OEM and ODM customers will actually take the design
      to
      production or that the design will be commercially successful. Furthermore,
      there may be changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays
      in
      the introduction of our customers’ products that could negatively impact the
      success of our products. Any of these factors could result in a loss of market
      share and could negatively impact our financial results.

Our
      business results could be adversely affected if our product development efforts
      are unsuccessful.

We
      have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products.
      Any
      delay in the future or failure of our GPUs or other processors to meet or exceed
      specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business.
      The
      success of our new product introductions will depend on many factors, including
      the following:


·

proper new
                product definition;

·

timely
                completion and introduction of new product designs;

·

the
                ability of third-party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our
                new
                products in a timely manner;

·

dependence
                on third-party subcontractors for assembly, testing and packaging
                of our
                products and in meeting product delivery schedules and maintaining
                product
                quality;

·

the
                quality of any new products;

·

differentiation
                of new products from those of our competitors;

·

market
                acceptance of our products and our customers' products; and

·

availability
                of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory
                products.

A
      critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with
      leaders in the computer aided design, or CAD, industry. We have invested
      significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders, including
      Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these companies
      in the product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these
      relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design,
      simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the
      3D
      graphics, communications and networking segments and develop products that
      utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. We believe this approach
      assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC OEMs and other
      manufacturers. If these relationships are not successful, we may not be able
      to
      develop new products in a timely manner, which could result in a loss of market
      share, a decrease in revenue and a negative impact on our operating results.
      Our
      failure to successfully develop, introduce or achieve market acceptance for
      new
      processors would harm our business.

Our
      failure to identify new market or product opportunities or develop new products
      could harm our business.

As
      our
      GPUs or other processors develop and competition increases, we anticipate that
      product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices
      will decline. In particular, we expect average selling prices and gross margins
      for our processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume
      increases. As a result, we will need to introduce new products and enhancements
      to existing products to maintain or improve overall average selling prices
      and
      gross margins. In order for our processors to achieve high volumes, leading
      PC
      OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our
      processor for design into their products, and then successfully complete the
      designs of their products and sell them. We may be unable to successfully
      identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market new
      products in a timely fashion. In addition, we cannot guarantee that new products
      we develop will be selected for design into PC OEMs’, ODMs’, and add-in board
      and motherboard manufacturers’ products, that any new designs will be
      successfully completed or that any new products will be sold.

As
      the
      complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for our products
      increases, there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with
      the
      performance of our products and that there will be delays in the development,
      introduction or volume shipment of our products. We may experience difficulties
      related to the production of current or future products or other factors that
      may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we develop. In
      addition, we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition
      risks with respect to future products. Failure to achieve any of the foregoing
      with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly
      declining average selling prices, reduced margins and reduced demand for
      products or loss of market share. In addition, technologies developed by others
      may render our processors non-competitive or obsolete or result in our holding
      excess inventory, any of which would harm our business.

We
      could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects.

Products
      as complex as those we offer may contain defects or experience failures when
      introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are
      released. We have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with
      customers’ hardware in some of our products and may experience delays or loss of
      revenue to correct any defects or incompatibilities in the future. Errors in
      new
      products or releases after commencement of


commercial
      shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design
      wins. Our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to
      beginning volume production and distribution. As a result, our products may
      contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and
      distribution. If these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to
      volume production and distribution, we may be required to reimburse customers
      for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field. We may also
      be required to incur additional research and development costs to find and
      correct the defect, which could divert the attention of our management and
      engineers from the development of new products. These costs could be significant
      and could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may also
      suffer a loss of reputation and/or a loss in our market share, either of which
      could materially harm our financial results.

Risks
      Related to Our Partners and Customers

There
      can be no assurance that the PlayStation3 will achieve long term commercial
      success.

In
      April
      2005, we finalized our definitive agreement with SCE to jointly develop a custom
      GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in
      SCE’s PlayStation3. Our collaboration with SCE includes license fees and
      royalties for the PlayStation3 and all derivatives, including next-generation
      digital consumer electronics devices.  In addition, we are licensing
      software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics
      capabilities to SCE. During fiscal 2006, we recognized $49.0 million of
      revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom
      GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in
      SCE’s PlayStation3. Depending on the ultimate success of this next-generation
      platform, we expect to generate, starting in fiscal 2007, revenue ranging from
      $50 million to $100 million annually from license fees and royalties over the
      next five years, with the possibility of additional royalties for several years
      thereafter. There can be no assurance that the PlayStation3 will achieve long
      term commercial success, given the intense competition in the game console
      market. Additionally, we do not have control over the launch date or
      pricing of the Playstation3. As such, we do not have control over when we will
      receive royalties. If we do not receive royalties as we anticipate, our revenue
      and gross margin may be adversely affected.

We
      may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of
      business acquisitions, which could hurt our ability to grow our business,
      develop new products or sell our products.

In
      the
      past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products,
      services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our
      products and services or help expand our distribution channels. We may enter
      into future acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, in order to
      complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market.
      For example, in

February
      2006 we completed the acquisition of ULi Electronics, Inc., or ULi, a leading
      developer of core logic technology, for approximately $53 million paid in cash.

If
      we do
      consider an acquisition, strategic alliance or joint venture, the negotiations
      could divert management’s attention as well as other resources. For any previous
      or future acquisition or investment, including ULi, the following risks could
      impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products, and
      ultimately, could impair our ability to sell our products, which could
      negatively impact our growth or our financial results:

·

difficulty
                in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of
                the
                acquired business with our
                business;

·

disruption
                of our ongoing businesses:

·

difficulty
                in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the
                transaction;

·

diversion
                of management’s attention from our
                business;

·

difficulty
                in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and
                policies;

·

disruption
                of or delays in ongoing research and development
                efforts;

·

diversion
                of capital and other resources;

·

assumption
                of liabilities;

·

diversion
                of resources and unanticipated expenses resulting from litigation
                arising from potential or actual business acquisitions or
                investments;

·

difficulties
                in entering into new markets in which we have limited or no experience
                and
                where competitors in such markets have stronger positions; and

·

impairment
                of relationships with employees and customers, or the loss of any
                of our
                key employees or of our target’s key employees, as a result of the
                integration of new businesses and management personnel.


In
      addition, the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash,
      shares of our common stock, the issuance of convertible debt securities or
      a
      combination of cash, convertible debt and common stock. If we pay all or a
      portion of the purchase price in cash, our cash reserves would be reduced.
      If
      the consideration is paid with shares of our common stock, or convertible
      debentures, the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted. We
      cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future acquisitions, or the effect
      that any such acquisitions might have on our operations or financial
      results.

We
      sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer
      by the loss of any of these customers.

We
      have
      only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated. Sales
      to our two largest customers accounted for approximately 26%, 31%, and 36%
      of
      our revenue during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the first
      quarter of fiscal 2006, Microsoft indicated that it would not order any more
      Xbox-related products from us after our second fiscal quarter. As a result,
      the
      second quarter of fiscal 2006 was the last quarter during which we recognized
      revenue from the sale of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft. Although a
      small number of our other customers represents the majority of our revenue,
      their end customers include a large number of OEMs and system integrators
      throughout the world who, in many cases, specify the graphics supplier. Our
      sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading PC OEMs and major
      system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production
      with key CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers. These design
      wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced
      by
      CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers. Our distribution
      strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent CEMs, ODMs,
      motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and distributors, each
      of
      which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading PC
      OEMs. If we were to lose sales to our PC OEMs, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and
      add-in board manufacturers and were unable to replace the lost sales with sales
      to different customers, or if they were to significantly reduce the number
      of
      products they order from us, our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected
      level in any period, which could harm our financial condition and our results
      of
      operations.

We
      depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products
      and
      these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements,
      which would harm our business.

We
      do not
      manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or
      operate a wafer fabrication facility. Our products require wafers manufactured
      with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques. We utilize
      industry-leading suppliers, such as Chartered, SMIC, TSMC, and UMC to produce
      our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent subcontractors to perform
      assembly, testing and packaging. We depend on these suppliers to allocate to
      us
      a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to
      produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields,
      and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices.
      These manufacturers may be unable to meet our near-term or long-term
      manufacturing or pricing requirements. We obtain manufacturing services on
      a
      purchase order basis. The foundries we use have no obligation to provide us
      with
      any specified minimum quantities of product. Suppliers, such as Chartered,
      SMIC,
      TSMC, and UMC, fabricate wafers for other companies, including some of our
      competitors, and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, reduce
      or
      eliminate deliveries to us, or increase the prices that they charge us on short
      notice. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated
      deliveries, we could lose sales to customers, which would negatively impact
      our
      revenue and our reputation. Because the lead-time needed to establish a
      strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several
      quarters, there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any
      specific product. In addition, the time and effort to qualify a new foundry
      could result in additional expense, diversion of resources or lost sales any
      of
      which would negatively impact our financial results. We believe that long-term
      market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with
      third-party manufacturers we may use to ensure adequate product supply and
      competitive pricing so that we are able to respond to customer demand.


We
      are dependent on third parties located outside of the United States for
      assembly, testing and packaging of our products, which reduces our control
      over
      the delivery and quantity of our products.

Our
      processors are assembled and tested by independent subcontractors, such as
      ASE,
      Amkor Technology Inc., KYEC, SPIL, and STATS ChipPAC Incorporated, all of which
      are located outside of the United States. We do not have long-term agreements
      with any of these subcontractors. As a result of our dependence on third-party
      subcontractors for assembly, testing and packaging of our products, we do not
      directly control product delivery schedules or product quality. Demand for
      qualified independent subcontractors to assemble and test products is high.
      If demand for these subcontractors exceeds the number of qualified
      subcontractors, we may experience capacity constraints, which could result
      in
      product shortages, a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase
      in
      product cost. Any of our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders
      of
      one of our competitors over our orders. Any product shortages, quality assurance
      problems or political instability outside of the United States could increase
      the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing of our products, which could
      cause
      our gross margin to decline. Due to the amount of time typically required to
      qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in the
      shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties
      to
      assemble or test our products or components. Any such delays could result in
      a
      loss of reputation or a decrease in sales to our customers.

We
      rely on third-party vendors to supply software development tools to us for
      the
      development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools
      necessary to develop these products.

In
      the
      design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on
      third-party software development tools. While we currently are not dependent
      on
      any one vendor for the supply of these tools, some or all of these tools may
      not
      be readily available in the future. For example, we have experienced delays
      in
      the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then
      available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features
      and
      functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet
      consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from processors
      in
      the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools that
      are available to us. If the software development tools we use become unavailable
      or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could
      suffer.

Difficulties
      in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against
      income and the deferral of revenue recognition from sales to affected customers,
      which could harm our operating results and financial condition.

Our
      accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse
      changes in our customers' businesses and to downturns in the economy and the
      industry. In addition, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or the
      loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our
      financial condition and results of operations. We continue to work directly
      with
      more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable
      from them. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
      resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This
      allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount
      based on overall estimated exposure. In addition, we purchase credit insurance
      on selected customers’ accounts receivable balances in an effort to further
      mitigate our exposure for such losses. If the financial condition of our
      customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability
      to
      make payments, additional allowances may be required, we may be required to
      defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required
      to pay higher credit insurance premiums, which could adversely affect our
      operating results. We may have to record additional reserves or write-offs
      and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions in the future, which could
      negatively impact our financial results.


Risks
      Related to Our Competition

The
      market for GPU, MCP, and Handheld GPUs is highly competitive and we may be
      unable to compete.

The
      market for GPUs, MCPs and Handheld GPUs is intensely competitive and is
      characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and
      declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive
      factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access
      to
      customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support,
      conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, price of
      processors and total system costs of add-in boards and motherboards. We believe
      that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able
      to
      anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether
      we
      are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels
      of
      quality. We expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and
      new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may
      provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products,
      which could harm our business.

An
      additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide
      or
      intend to provide GPU, MCP, and Handheld GPU solutions. Some of our competitors
      may have or be able to obtain greater marketing, financial, distribution and
      manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer
      or
      technological changes. Our current competitors include the following:

·

suppliers
                of discrete MCPs that incorporate a combination of networking, audio,
                communications and input/output, or I/O, functionality as part of
                their
                existing solutions, such as ATI Technologies, Inc., or ATI, Broadcom
                Corporation, or Broadcom, and
                Intel;

·

suppliers
                of GPUs, including MCPs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality
                as part
                of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Intel, Matrox Electronics
                Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems, Inc., VIA Technologies,
                Inc.,
                and XGI Technology Inc.; and

·

suppliers
                of GPUs or GPU intellectual property for handheld and embedded devices
                that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their
                existing
                solutions, such as ATI, Bitboys, Broadcom, Fujitsu Limited, Imagination
                Technologies Ltd., NEC Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas
                Technology Corp., Seiko-Epson, Texas Instruments Incorporated, and
                Toshiba
                America, Inc.

If
      and to
      the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise PC,
      notebook, workstation, PDA, cellular phone, and video game console markets,
      we
      may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from
      companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately predict
      if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. If we are
      unable to compete in our current and any new markets, our financial results
      will
      suffer.

As
      Intel continues to pursue platform solutions, we may not be able to successfully
      compete.

We
      expect
      substantial competition from Intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling
      platform solutions dominated by Intel products, such as when Intel achieved
      success with its Centrino platform solution. In addition to its current Centrino
      notebook platform initiative, and its announced upcoming desktop initiative
      branded as VIIV, we expect that Intel is now focused on developing and selling
      platform solutions for all segments including professional workstations and
      servers. If Intel continues to pursue these initiatives, we may not be able
      to
      successfully compete in these segments.

Risks
      Related to Market Conditions

We
      are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm
      our
      business.

A
      significant portion of our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled,
      tested and packaged by third-parties located outside of the United States.
      Additionally, we generated 84%, 76% and 75% of our total revenue from sales
      to
      customers outside of the United States and other Americas for fiscal 2006,
      and 2004, respectively. The manufacture, assembly, test and packaging of our
      products outside of the United States and sales to these


customers
      outside of the United States and other Americas subjects us to a number of
      risks
      associated with conducting business outside of the United States and other
      Americas, including, but not limited to:

·

international
                economic and political conditions;

·

unexpected
                changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;

·

labor
                issues in foreign countries;

·

cultural
                differences in the conduct of business;

·

inadequate
                local infrastructure;

·

delays
                resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain
                technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and
                restrictions;

·

transportation
                delays;

·

longer
                payment cycles;

·

difficulty
                in collecting accounts receivable;

·

fluctuations
                in currency exchange rates;

·

imposition
                of additional taxes and penalties;

·

different
                legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property;

·

the
                burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and

·

other
                factors beyond our control, including terrorism, civil unrest, war
                and
                diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Avian
                flu.

If
      sales
      to any of our customers outside of the United States and other Americas are
      delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be
      negatively impacted.

We
      have
      offices outside of the United States, including offices in Taiwan, Japan, Korea,
      China, Hong Kong, India, France, Russia, Germany and England. During fiscal
      2006, we substantially increased our international employee resources from
      employees as of January 30, 2005 to 615 full-time employees as of January 29,
      2006.

On
      February 20, 2006, we completed the acquisition of ULi, a leading developer
      of
      core logic technology, which added approximately $18 to $22 employees to our
      international operations.

Our
      operations in our international locations are subject to many of the risks
      contained in the above list. We intend to continue to expand our international
      operations and to open other international offices. Difficulties with our
      international operations, including finding appropriate staffing and office
      space, may divert management’s attention and other resources any of which could
      negatively impact our operating results.

Currently,
      all of our arrangements with third-party manufacturers and subcontractors
      provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars as are sales to our
      customers located outside of the United States and other Americas. Increases
      in
      the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make
      our products more expensive, which would negatively impact our ability to
      compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar
      relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices
      in order to continue doing business with us. To date, we have not engaged in
      any
      currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations
      in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future.

We
      are dependent on the PC market and the rate of its growth has and may in the
      future have a negative impact on our business.

We
      derive
      the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop
      PC
      and notebook PC markets, including professional workstations. We expect to
      continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products
      for
      use in the desktop PC and notebook PC markets in the next several years. A
      reduction in sales of PCs, or a reduction in the growth rate of PC sales, will
      reduce demand for our products. Moreover, changes in demand could be large
      and
      sudden. Since PC manufacturers often build inventories during periods of
      anticipated growth, they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows
      or
      if they incorrectly forecast product transitions. In these cases, PC
      manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional
      inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed,
      which would have a negative impact on our business.


If
      our products do not continue to be accepted by the

consumer and enterprise PC, notebook, workstation, PDA, cellular phone, and
      video game console markets

or if the demand in these markets for new and innovative products decreases,
      our
      business and operating results would suffer.

Our
      success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our processors for
      3D
      graphics in

consumer
      and enterprise PC, notebook, workstation, PDA, cellular phone, and video game
      console

applications.
      The market for processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes
      rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often caused by the publication
      of
      competitive industry benchmark results, changes in pricing of dynamic
      random-access memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of
      add-in boards, as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new
      technology and product introductions. Only a small number of products have
      achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance, if achieved, is
      difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology
      and
      product introductions. Since the GPU Business is our core business, our
      financial results would suffer if for any reason our current or future GPUs
      do
      not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the PC market. If we are unable
      to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to
      successfully and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet
      the
      requirements of the consumer and enterprise PC, notebook, and workstation
      markets, we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact
      our operating results. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the industry
      will continue to demand new products with improved standards, features or
      performance. If our customers and the market do not continue to demand new
      products with increased performance, features, functionality or standards,
      sales
      of our products could decline.

Our
      failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result
      in
      a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of production, excess
      inventory, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities.

We
      may be
      subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations
      governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain
      substances in electronic products and making producers of those products
      financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal
      of
      those products. For example, the semiconductor industry is moving towards
      becoming compliant with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive,
      or
      RoHS Directive, which will become effective in July 2006. The RoHS Directive
      is
      European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including
      lead. Similarly, the State of California has adopted certain restrictions,
      which
      go into effect in 2007, that restrict the use of certain materials in electronic
      products, that are intended to harmonize with the RoHS directive and other
      states are contemplating similar legislation. China has promulgated use
      restrictions on the same substances as the RoHS directive, but has not yet
      defined either the scope of the affected products or an effective date of any
      such restrictions.

Also,
      we
      could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with the Waste
      Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or WEEE. The WEEE directs members
      of the European Union to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions
      to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially
      responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally
      responsible disposal of certain products sold into the market after August
      15,
      2005 and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced. We
      continue to evaluate the impact of specific registration and compliance
      activities required by WEEE.

It
      is
      possible that unanticipated supply shortages, delays or excess non-compliant
      inventory may occur as a result of such regulations. Failure to comply with
      any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences
      including fines, suspension of production, excess inventory, sales limitations,
      and criminal and civil liabilities.

Hostilities
      involving the United States and/or terrorist attacks could harm our business.

The
      financial, political, economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist
      attacks on the United States in 2001 led to a weakening of the global
      economy. Similar terrorist acts and/or the threat of future outbreak or
      continued escalation of hostilities involving the United States and Iraq or
      other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have
      an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
      In addition, any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt
      our operations or those of our customers, distributors and suppliers, which
      could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
      operations.


Our
      business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our financial
      results.

Our
      business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical
      semiconductor industry, including alternating periods of overcapacity and
      capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing costs and yields, significant
      expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid
      technological change. If we are unable to respond to changes in our industry,
      which can be unpredictable and rapid, in an efficient and timely manner, our
      operating results could suffer. In particular, from time to time, the
      semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged
      downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion
      of
      average selling prices. If we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing
      our manufacturing or operating costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand
      during a downturn, our revenue and earnings will suffer.

Political
      instability in Taiwan and in The People’s Republic of China or elsewhere could
      harm our business.

Because
      of our reliance on foundries and independent contractors located in Taiwan
      and
      The People’s Republic of China, and because we have offices in these locations,
      our business may be harmed by political instability in Taiwan, including the
      worsening of the strained relations between The People’s Republic of China and
      Taiwan. Also if relations between the United States and The People’s Republic of
      China are strained due to foreign relations events. If any of our suppliers
      experienced a substantial disruption in their operations, as a result of a
      natural disaster, political unrest, economic instability, acts of terrorism
      or
      war, equipment failure or other cause, it could harm our business.

We
      are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments
      and in interest rates.

We
      invest
      in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments
      in
      commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of
      corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies.
      These investments are denominated in United States dollars.

We
      account for our investment instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 115. All
      of
      the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and
      floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate
      risk.
      Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due
      to
      a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income
      than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future
      investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
      rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments
      is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if
      forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in
      interest rates. However, because our debt securities are classified as
“available-for-sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in
      interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity.

Risks
      Related to Government Action, Regulatory Action, Intellectual Property, and
      Litigation

Expensing
      employee stock options in future periods will materially and aversely affect
      our
      reported operating results and could adversely affect our competitive position
      as well.

Since
      inception, we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program
      as
      fundamental components of our compensation packages. To date we generally have
      not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold
      pursuant to our employee stock purchase program. We believe that these
      incentives directly motivate our employees and, through the use of vesting,
      encourage our employees to remain with us. In December 2004, the FASB issued
      SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
      Payment,

which
      requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
      stock-based compensation payments. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective
      date of SFAS No. 123(R), which is now effective for annual periods that begin
      after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that we record compensation
      expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan


using
      the
      fair value of those awards. Expensing these incentives in future periods will
      materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the
      stock-based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported
      earnings. We anticipate that our stock-based compensation expense will be
      approximately $18 to $22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and we
      are
      unsure how the market will react to this adverse affect on our operating
      results, which could impact our stock price.

To
      the
      extent that SFAS No. 123(R) makes it more expensive to grant stock options
      or to
      continue to have an employee stock purchase program, we may decide to incur
      increased cash compensation costs. In addition, actions that we may take to
      reduce stock-based compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions
      our competitors may implement may make it difficult to attract, retain and
      motivate employees, which could adversely affect our competitive position as
      well as our business and operating results.

We
      are currently involved in patent litigation, which, if not resolved favorably,
      could require us to pay damages.

We
      are
      currently involved in patent litigation. On October 19, 2004, Opti Incorporated,
      or Opti, filed a complaint for patent infringement against us in the United
      States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Opti asserts that
      unspecified NVIDIA chipsets infringe five United States patents held by Opti.
      Opti seeks unspecified damages for our alleged conduct, attorneys fees and
      triple damages because of our alleged willful infringement of these patents.
      NVIDIA filed a response to this complaint in December 2004. After a case
      management conference in July 2005, discovery began and a trial date has now
      been set for July 2006. A court mandated mediation was held in January 2006
      and
      did not resolve the matter. We believe the claims asserted against us are
      without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously.

In
      August
      2004, a Texas limited partnership named American Video Graphics, LP, or AVG,
      filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various
      corporate defendants, not including NVIDIA, in the United States District Court
      for the Eastern District of Texas. AVG initially asserted that each of the
      approximately thirty defendants sells products that infringe one or more of
      seven separate patents that AVG claims relate generally to graphics processing
      functionality. In November 2004, NVIDIA sought and was granted permission to
      intervene in two of the three pending AVG lawsuits. Our complaint in
      intervention alleged that both of the patents in suit were invalid and that,
      to
      the extent AVG’s claims target NVIDIA products, the asserted patents were not
      infringed.

On
      December 19, 2005, AVG and substantially all of the named defendants and
      intervenors, including NVIDIA, settled all of pending claims; the only surviving
      claims will relate solely to two non-settling defendants. As part of the
      settlement, the defendants and intervenors paid an undisclosed aggregate amount
      to AVG. In exchange, all pending claims between the settling parties were
      dismissed with prejudice, and AVG granted to all settling parties a full release
      of all claims for past damages and a full license for all future sales of
      accused products under all of AVG’s patents, including the patents in suit. In
      addition, as part of the settlement, all settling defendants and intervenors
      fully and finally waived any claims for indemnification they may have had
      against any other settling party.

Our
      defenses against Opti may be unsuccessful. If this case goes forward, or if
      other patent litigation matters involving us arise, we expect that they will
      result in additional legal and other costs, such as those costs associated
      with
      the AVG suit, regardless of the outcome, which could be
      substantial.

Our
      industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual
      property rights and positions which could result in significant
      expense.

The
      semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit
      of
      intellectual property rights and positions, which have resulted in protracted
      and expensive litigation. The graphics processor industry, in particular, has
      been recently characterized by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property
      positions, and we expect our competitors and others will continue to
      aggressively pursue intellectual property positions. The technology that we
      use
      to design and develop our products and that is incorporated into our products
      may be subject to claims that it infringes the patents or intellectual property
      rights of others. Our success is dependent on our ability to


develop
      new products without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property
      rights of others or by licensing the intellectual property of third parties.
      As
      such, we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation into
      our
      products, and expect to continue to enter into license agreements with third
      parties for future products. These licenses may result in royalty payments
      to
      third parties, the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other
      consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially
      reasonable terms, or at all, our competitive position and our business could
      suffer.

Our
      ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our
      intellectual property.

We
      rely
      primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee
      and
      third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect
      our
      intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We have numerous
      patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and in foreign
      countries. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology
      used
      by us in connection with our products, including our processors. We also rely
      on
      international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our
      intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our
      products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in
      Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same
      extent as by the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy
      of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether
      and
      where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies
      based on such factors as the:

·

commercial
                significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in
                particular countries and regions;

·

location
                in which our products are manufactured;

·

our
                strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
                and

·

degree
                to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced
                in
                different jurisdictions.

Our
      pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved.
      In
      addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages
      or
      may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may
      harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop
      substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to
      our
      trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect
      our
      intellectual property could harm our business.

Litigation
      to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to
      enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation
      could result in substantial costs to us.

From
      time
      to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we
      have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third
      parties. We expect that, as the number of issued hardware and software patents
      increases, and as competition in our product lines intensifies, the volume
      of
      intellectual property infringement claims may increase. We may become involved
      in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement
      or
      other intellectual property rights violations by us or by our customers that
      we
      have agreed to indemnify them for certain claims of infringement arising out
      of
      the sale of our products to these customers. In addition, litigation or other
      legal proceedings may be necessary to:

·

assert
                claims of infringement;

·

enforce
                our patents

·

protect
                our trade secrets or know-how; or

·

determine
                the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of
                others.

If
      infringement claims are made against us, we may seek licenses under the
      claimants’ patents or other intellectual property rights. In addition, we or an
      indemnified customer may be required to obtain a license to a third parties’
patents or intellectual property. However, licenses may not be offered to us
      at
      all or on terms acceptable to us, particularly by competitors. If we fail to
      obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used
      in one of our products used by an indemnified customer, we could be subject
      to
      substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and
      sale of one or more of our products either of which could reduce our revenue
      and
      harm our business. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer may increase
      our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating
      results.


Alternatively,
      we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement
      of
      our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights,
      which could be costly. If we have to initiate a claim, our operating expenses
      may increase which could negatively impact our operating results. Additionally,
      if one of our patents is invalidated or found to be unenforceable, we would
      be
      unable to license the patent which could result in a loss of
      revenue.

Regardless
      of the outcome, litigation or negotiations involving intellectual property
      rights can be very costly and can divert management’s attention from other
      matters. We may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits or
      claims. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation
      of
      a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost
      profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief.

Our
      operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected
      tax
      liabilities.

We
      are
      subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United States
      and throughout the world. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we
      operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for
      our
      income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate
      tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are
      reasonable, any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially
      different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions
      and
      accruals:

·

the
                jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;

·

adjustments
                to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;

·

changes
                in available tax credits;

·

changes
                in share-based compensation expense;

·

changes
                in tax laws, the interpretation of tax laws either in the United
                States or
                abroad or the issuance of new interpretative accounting guidance
                related
                to uncertain transactions and calculations where the tax treatment
                was
                previously uncertain; and

·

the
                resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax
                authorities.

Should
      additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above, our operating
      results could be adversely affected.

While
      we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial
      reporting, we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to
      evaluate those internal controls.

Section 404
      of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and
      our
      independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness
      of
      our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. We have
      an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing
      necessary to comply with these requirements. This legislation is relatively
      new
      and neither companies nor accounting firms have significant experience in
      complying with its requirements. As a result, we have incurred, and expect
      to
      continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management
      resources to Section 404 compliance. In the event that our chief executive
      officer, chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting
      firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not
      effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions of us may be
      adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock.

Risks
      Related to our Common Stock

Our
      stock price may continue to experience significant short-term fluctuations.

The
      trading price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly. These price
      fluctuations have been rapid and severe. We believe that our quarterly and
      annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of


factors
      that could harm our revenue, gross profit and results of operations, any of
      which could impact our stock price. Additionally, the price of our common stock
      may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are
      non-company specific, such as the decline in the United States and/or
      international economies, acts of terror against the United States, war or due
      to
      a variety of company specific factors, including quarter to quarter variations
      in our operating results, shortfalls in revenue, gross margin or earnings from
      levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed in these
      risk factors.

Provisions
      in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft
      could delay or prevent a change in control.

Our
      certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make
      it
      more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting
      stock. These provisions include the following:

·

the
                ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock
                without prior stockholder
                approval;

·

the
                prohibition of stockholder action by written consent;

·

a
                classified board of directors; and

·

advance
                notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals.

On
      March
      5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to
      develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft
      and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual
      or
      corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30%
      of
      the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last
      rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other
      factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA.

ITEM
      2. PROPERTIES

Our
      headquarters complex is located on a leased site in Santa Clara, California
      and
      is comprised of five buildings. Additionally, we lease three other buildings
      in
      Santa Clara with one used as warehouse space and the other two used as lab
      space. Outside of Santa Clara, we lease space in Austin and Houston, Texas;
      Berkeley, California; Beaverton, Oregon; Bedford, Massachusetts; Bellevue,
      Washington; Chandler, Arizona; Durham, North Carolina; Greenville, South
      Carolina; Fort Collins, Colorado; and Redmond, Washington. These facilities
      are
      used as design centers and/or sales and administrative offices.

Outside
      of the United States, we lease space in Taipei and Hsin Chu, Taiwan; Tokyo,
      Japan; Seoul, Korea; Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, China; Wanchai, and
      Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong; Bangalore, and Pune, India; Paris, France;

ITEM
      3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

3dfx

On
      December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries
      entered into an agreement to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx.
      The 3dfx asset purchase closed on April 18, 2001.

In
        May
        2002, we were served with a California state court complaint filed by the
        landlord of 3dfx’s San Jose, California commercial real estate lease. In
        December 2002, we were served with a California state court complaint filed
        by
        the landlord of 3dfx’s Austin, Texas commercial real estate lease. The
        landlords’ complaints both assert claims for, among other things, interference
        with contract, successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seek to recover,
        among other things, amounts owed on their leases with 3dfx in the aggregate
        amount of approximately $10 million. In October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter
        bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
        District of California. The landlords’ actions were subsequently removed to the
        United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California and
        consolidated with a complaint filed by the Trustee in the 3dfx bankruptcy
        case
        for purposes of discovery. Upon motion by NVIDIA in 2005, the District Court
        withdrew the reference to the Bankruptcy Court and the landlord actions were
        removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of
        California. On November 10, 2005, the District Court granted NVIDIA's motion
        to
        dismiss the landlords’ respective amended complaints and allowed the landlords
        to have until February 4, 2006 to amend their complaints. The landlords’ refiled
        claims against NVIDIA in early February 2006, and NVIDIA again requested
        the
        District Court to dismiss all such claims made by the landlords. A hearing
        on
        NVIDIA’s new motions to dismiss is set for hearing on April 17, 2006. Discovery
        is stayed pending this hearing and no trial date has been set in these actions.
        We believe the claims asserted against us by the landlords are without merit
        and
        we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously.

In
      March
      2003, we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the
      Bankruptcy Court to represent the interests of the 3dfx bankruptcy estate.
      The
      Trustee’s complaint asserts claims for, among other things, successor liability
      and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us.  On October
      13, 2005, the Court held a hearing on the Trustee’s motion for summary
      adjudication. On December 23, 2005, the Court issued its ruling denying the
      Trustee's Motion for Summary Adjudication in all material respects and holding
      that NVIDIA is prevented from disputing that the value of the 3dfx
      transaction to NVIDIA was less than $108.0 million. The Court
      expressly denied the Trustee's request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets
      conveyed to NVIDIA were at least $108.0 million. In early November 2005, after
      many months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured
      Creditors, or the Creditors’ Committee, reached a conditional settlement of the
      Trustee’s claims against NVIDIA.  This conditional
      settlement, presented as the centerpiece of a proposed Plan of Liquidation
      in the bankruptcy case, is subject to a confirmation process
      through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy
      Court after notice and hearing.

The
      scope
      and schedule for that confirmation process has yet to be determined,
      but

we
      expect
      that hearing to now occur sometime in the next few months. The Trustee has
      advised that he intends to object to the settlement. The settlement with the
      Creditors’ Committee calls for a payment of approximately $30.6 million to the
      3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million relates to various
      administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million relates to the
      satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors
      of
      3dfx. As such, during the three month period ended October 30, 2005, we recorded
      $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional
      purchase price for 3dfx.

The
      Bankruptcy Court, over objection of the Creditors’ Committee and NVIDIA, has
      ordered the discovery portion of the litigation to proceed while the settlement
      is pending approval through the confirmation process. However, no trial date
      has
      been set in the Trustee's action. In addition, following the Trustee’s filing of
      a Form 8-K on behalf of 3dfx, in which the Trustee disclosed the terms of the
      proposed settlement agreement between NVIDIA and the Creditor’s Committee,
      certain shareholders of 3dfx filed a petition with the Bankruptcy Court to
      appoint an official committee to represent the claimed interest’s of 3dfx
      shareholders. That petition was granted and an Equity Holder’s Committee was
      appointed. Counsel for the Equity Holder’s Committee has announced an intention
      to file a competing Plan of Reorganization or Liquidation in the Trustee’s
      case.


Opti
      Incorporated

On
      October 19, 2004, Opti Incorporated, or Opti, filed a complaint for patent
      infringement against NVIDIA in the United States District Court for the Eastern
      District of Texas. Opti asserts that unspecified NVIDIA chipsets infringe five
      U.S. patents held by Opti. Opti seeks unspecified damages for our alleged
      conduct, attorneys’ fees and triple damages for alleged willful infringement by
      NVIDIA. NVIDIA filed a response to this complaint in December 2004. A case
      management conference was held in July 2005 where a trial date was set for
      July
      2006. A court mandated mediation was held in January 2006 and did not resolve
      the matter. Discovery continues, as well as preparation for the Markman hearing
      on claim construction. The Markman hearing is scheduled for April 13, 2006.
      We
      believe the claims asserted against us are without merit and we will continue
      to
      defend ourselves vigorously.

We
      do not
      have sufficient information to determine whether a loss is probable. As such,
      we
      have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for
      such, if any, loss.

American
      Video Graphics

In
      August
      2004, a Texas limited partnership named American Video Graphics, LP, or AVG,
      filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various
      corporate defendants, not including NVIDIA, in the United States District Court
      for the Eastern District of Texas. AVG initially asserted that each of the
      approximately thirty defendants sells products that infringe one or more of
      seven separate patents that AVG claims relate generally to graphics processing
      functionality. In November 2004, NVIDIA sought and was granted permission to
      intervene in two of the three pending AVG lawsuits. Our complaint in
      intervention alleged that both of the patents in suit were invalid and that,
      to
      the extent AVG’s claims target NVIDIA products, the asserted patents were not
      infringed.

On
      December 19, 2005, AVG and substantially all of the named defendants and
      intervenors, including NVIDIA, settled all of pending claims; the only surviving
      claims will relate solely to two non-settling defendants. As part of the
      settlement, the defendants and intervenors paid an undisclosed aggregate amount
      to AVG. In exchange, all pending claims between the settling parties were
      dismissed with prejudice, and AVG granted to all settling parties a full release
      of all claims for past damages and a full license for all future sales of
      accused products under all of AVG’s patents, including the patents in suit. In
      addition, as part of the settlement, all settling defendants and intervenors
      fully and finally waived any claims for indemnification they may have had
      against any other settling party.

We
      are
      subject to other legal proceedings, but we do not believe that the ultimate
      outcome of any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on
      our
      financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, if
      an
      unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the
      possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that
      period.

Issuer
      Purchases of Equity Securities

On
      August
      9, 2004 we announced that our Board of Directors, or the Board, had authorized
      a
      stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject
      to
      certain specifications, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $300.0 million.
      As
      part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into and we may continue
      to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial
      institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front
      payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our
      common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number
      of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of
      the
      term of the agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repurchased
      1.3 million shares of our common stock for $50.0 million under a structured
      share repurchase transaction, which we recorded on the trade date of the
      transaction. Through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we have
      repurchased 8.5 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total
      cost of $213.2 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we entered
      into
      a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common
      stock for $50.0 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first
      fiscal quarter.

On
      March
      6, 2006, we announced that our Board had approved an increase in our
      existing stock repurchase program. We announced a $400 million increase to
      the
      original stock repurchase program we had announced in August 2004. As a result
      of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board of Directors has
      authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of $700 million.
      The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately
      negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase transactions, in
      compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject
      to
      market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program
      does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and
      the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

Overview

Our
      Company

NVIDIA
      Corporation is the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor
      technologies. Our products enhance the end-user experience on consumer and
      professional computing devices. We have four major product-line operating
      segments: graphics processing units, or GPUs, media and communications
      processors, or MCPs, Handheld GPUs, and Consumer Electronics. Our GPU Business
      is composed of products that support desktop personal computers, or PCs,
      notebook PCs and professional workstations; our MCP Business is composed of
      NVIDIA nForce products that operate as a single-chip or chipset that can
      off-load system functions, such as audio processing and network communications,
      and perform these operations independently from the host central processing
      unit, or CPU; our Handheld GPU Business is composed of products that support
      handheld personal digital assistants, cellular phones and other handheld
      devices; and the Consumer Electronics Business is concentrated in products
      that
      support video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices
      and
      is composed of our contractual arrangements with Sony Computer Entertainment,
      or
      SCE, to jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce
      GPU and SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s PlayStation3, sales of our Xbox-related
      products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft relating to the
      successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the Xbox360, and related
      devices, and digital media processor products.

Fiscal
      2006 Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

As
      we
      entered fiscal 2006, we had launched the GeForce 6 Series, nForce 4 MCP, and
      Scalable Link Interface, or SLI, technology, with positive market reception.
      Our
      primary objective during the year was to strengthen the technology leadership
      position of our GPU and MCP businesses, extend the reach of SLI technology
      with
      a broad range of compatible products, applications and games for enthusiasts,
      improve gross margin beyond historical levels, and build new products and market
      initiatives that would be the platform for our continued growth.

GPU
      Business

In
      February 2005, we announced the GeForce Go 6600, a mobile GPU designed
      specifically to deliver advanced multimedia functionality without sacrificing
      portability.  Also in February 2005, we introduced the GeForce Go 6800
      Ultra mobile GPU.

In
      March
      2005, we introduced two new GeForce 6 GPUs: a 512MB version of the GeForce
      Ultra GPU designed for the enthusiast segment, and a new lower-cost AGP version
      of the GeForce 6200 GPU, designed to bring DirectX 9.0 Shader Model 3.0
      technology to the mainstream segment.

In
      June
      2005, we launched and shipped our second generation Shader Model 3.0 GPU, the
      GeForce 7800 GTX, which is designed to address the high-end enthusiast desktop
      PC segment. In August 2005, we launched and shipped our second GeForce 7 GPU,
      the GeForce 7800 GT, which is designed to address the high-end performance
      desktop PC segment.

In
      June
      2005, we made our SLI technology available to users in the mainstream segment
      with the release of our GeForce 6600.


In
      July
      2005, we introduced two new NVIDIA Quadro GPUs, the NVIDIA Quadro FX 4500 and
      the NVIDIA Quadro FX 3450, which are designed for the high-end and mainstream
      professional segments, respectively. Both products support our SLI
      technology.

In
      September 2005, we launched and shipped the new NVIDIA GeForce Go 7800 GTX,
      the
      flagship of the NVIDIA notebook GPU product line.

In
      October 2005, we announced that we will be the exclusive provider of all
      graphics cards offered on the first peripheral component interconnect, or PCI,
      express platform from Apple Computer, Inc., or Apple. In addition, the first
      ever Apple Power Mac will incorporate our NVIDIA Quadro professional-class
      GPU.

In
      November 2005, we introduced and shipped the NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GTX 512 GPU,
      which contains over 302 million transistors and is the industry’s only
      mainstream GPU to incorporate 64-bit HDR. We also announced the immediate
      availability of the NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GS GPU, which is designed for the
      mainstream segment.

In
      January 2006, we shipped the GeForce 7300 GS, our first mainstream version
      of
      the GeForce 7 series. We also introduced three new notebook GPUs - the GeForce
      Go 7800, GeForce Go 7600 and GeForce Go 7400 - all based on our second
      generation Shader Model 3.0 architecture and designed to deliver cutting-edge
      3D, high-definition, or HD, home theatre-quality video and advanced power
      management to the notebook market.

The
      combination of our GeForce 7 and GeForce 6 series of GPUs and our SLI technology
      has created a new class of gaming PCs and professional workstations.  SLI
      technology takes advantage of the increased bandwidth of the PCI Express bus
      architecture to allow two NVIDIA-based graphics cards to operate in a single
      PC
      or professional workstation.

More
      than
      3 million motherboards incorporating SLI technology and 9 million GPUs
      incorporating SLI technology have shipped to date.

In
      the
      upcoming fiscal year, we expect additional growth in our GPU Business. We
      believe that sales of our desktop GPU products will be increased by share gains
      from our anticipated position in the market, Microsoft Windows Vista, or Vista,
      the introduction of HD and Blu-ray video. We expect to extend our technology
      and
      performance leadership. The GeForce 7 and GeForce 6 series of desktop and
      notebook GPUs are designed to be compatible with Vista, which is scheduled
      to be
      released in the second half of calendar 2006. We believe that in the upcoming
      year there will be increased demand for HD video, and that Sony PlayStation3
      will be a key driver of demand for HD and Blu-ray video. We expect HD and
      Blu-ray video to promote increased demand for the video processing
      capabilities of our next generation GPUs.

MCP
      Business

In
      April
      2005, we announced the availability of our NVIDIA nForce4 SLI Intel Corporation,
      or Intel, Edition MCP for Intel platforms.  This line of core-logic
      solutions incorporates a host of new and innovative features that have never
      before been available on the Intel platform and extends the NVIDIA nForce brand
      into new segments.  In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2006,
      we shipped the NVIDIA nForce Professional MCP in its first enterprise server
      platform.

In
      August
      2005, we announced that the NVIDIA nForce4 SLI X16 Intel Edition technology
      featured in the Dell Dimension XPS 600 desktop PC was immediately
      available.

In
      September 2005, we introduced and shipped the NVIDIA nForce 400 MCP and GeForce
      6100 integrated GPU family. This represents the first integrated GPU solution
      to
      support DirectX 9.0 Shader Model 3.0 technology. We expect this integrated
      solution to be an important new growth factor for our GPU and MCP
      businesses.

In
      December 2005, we announced our intent to acquire ULi Electronics, Inc., or
      ULi,
      one of the PC industry’s most highly regarded core logic developers.

On
      February 20, 2006, we completed the acquisition of ULi.

The
      acquisition represents our ongoing investment in ULi’s platform solution
      strategy and is expected to strengthen our sales, marketing, and customer
      engineering presence in Taiwan and China.


In
      January 2006, we shipped the NVIDIA nForce 4 SLI XE and NVIDIA nForce4 Ultra
      Intel MCPs. These products represent our first discrete chipsets targeted at
      mainstream Intel-based motherboards.

Our
      NVIDIA nForce product line has achieved record revenue for six consecutive
      quarters.  We believe that Advanced Micro Devices’ transition to K8, our
      extension into new segments, and our entry into the Intel market with our first
      ever mainstream Intel nForce4 MCPs will make our MCP Business one of our fastest
      growing businesses. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to simultaneously
      innovate using our GPU, MCP, and software knowledge base will allow us to make
      additional platform innovations in the future.

Handheld
      GPU Business

Our
      strategy in the Handheld GPU Business is to lead innovation and capitalize
      on
      the emergence of the mobile phone as a versatile consumer lifestyle
      device.  Our initial focus was on 3G cellular phones.  Through the
      first half of fiscal 2006, our Handheld GPU Business was heavily concentrated
      at
      one original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, and its products did not achieve
      the anticipated level of commercial success.  However, during the third
      quarter of fiscal 2006, Motorola Inc. and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications
      AB
      launched 3G models of their RAZR and Walkman portable phones, respectively,
      that
      are both powered by our GoForce GPUs.

Our
      GoForce handheld GPUs are now shipping in the new Motorola 3G RAZR V3X and
      the
      new Sony Ericsson Walkman phones. Our strategy is to build a new class
      of low power GPUs for multimedia rich devices like 3G cell phones, smart
      phones, and portable media players. We believe that there will be an increase
      in
      demand for mobile video products that deliver compelling and tangible
      improvements to the overall end user experience of these new services, and
      we
      believe that we are well positioned to increase our share of the handheld
      segment in the upcoming year.

Consumer
      Electronics Business

In
      April
      2005, we finalized our definitive agreement with SCE to jointly develop a custom
      GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in
      SCE’s PlayStation3. Our collaboration with SCE includes license fees and
      royalties for the PlayStation3 and all derivatives, including next-generation
      digital consumer electronics devices.  In addition, we are licensing
      software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics
      capabilities to SCE. During fiscal 2006, we recognized $49.0 million of
      revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom
      GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in
      SCE’s PlayStation3. Depending on the ultimate success of this next-generation
      platform, we expect to generate, starting in fiscal 2007, revenue ranging from
      $50 million to $100 million annually from license fees and royalties over the
      next five years with the possibility of additional royalties for several years
      thereafter. We have successfully reached many development milestones and we
      believe that we are on target to achieve the goals set by SCE.

During
      the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Microsoft indicated that it would not order
      any more Xbox-related products from us after our second fiscal quarter. As
      a
      result, the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was the last quarter during which
      we
      recognized revenue from the sale of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft.

Gross
      Margin Improvement

We
      continue to remain intensely focused on improving our gross margin. Beginning
      in
      fiscal 2005, we implemented profit improvement initiatives across our company
      which were designed to improve business and operational processes. During the
      fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, our gross margin was 40.2%, which represents
      an
      increase of 600 basis points from our gross margin of 34.2% for the fourth
      quarter of fiscal 2005. Our gross margin was 38.3% for fiscal 2006, which
      represents an increase of 600 basis points from our gross margin of 32.3% for
      fiscal 2005. We believe that we can continue to improve our gross margin during
      fiscal 2007.


Share-Based
      Payment

Since
      inception, we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program
      as
      fundamental components of our employee compensation packages. To date we
      generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options
      or
      shares sold pursuant to our employee stock purchase program. We believe that
      these incentives directly motivate our employees and, through the use of
      vesting, encourage our employees to remain with us. In December 2004, the
      Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
      Payment

,
      which
      requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
      stock-based compensation payments. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective
      date of SFAS No. 123(R), which is now effective for annual periods that begin
      after June 15, 2005. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
      No.
      107, or SAB No. 107, which includes interpretive guidance for the initial
      implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) allows for either prospective
      recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition. We intend
      to
      adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires
      the
      application of the accounting standard as of January 30, 2006, the first day
      of
      our fiscal 2007. Expensing these incentives in future periods will materially
      and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stock-based
      compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings.
      We
      anticipate that our stock-based compensation expense will be approximately
      $18
      to $22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and we are unsure how the
      market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results, which could
      impact our stock price.

To
      the
      extent that SFAS No. 123(R) makes it more expensive to grant stock options
      or to
      continue to have an employee stock purchase program, we may decide to incur
      increased cash compensation costs. In addition, actions that we may take to
      reduce stock-based compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions
      our competitors may implement may make it difficult to attract, retain and
      motivate employees, which could adversely affect our competitive position as
      well as our business and operating results.

Repatriation
      Legislation

The
      American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or Act, was signed into law on October
      22,
      2004. The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States multinational
      corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the United States
      at a federal effective tax rate of 5.25%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006,
      we repatriated $420 million in foreign earnings under the Act. The net tax
      effect of this distribution was minimal because the current tax cost at a 5.25%
      tax rate was offset by the benefit attributable to reducing our deferred tax
      liability for taxes on earnings previously provided at the statutory rate of
      35%.

Subsequent
      Events

ULI
      Electronics, Inc.

On
      February 20, 2006, we completed the acquisition of ULi Electronics, Inc., a
      leading developer of core logic technology, for approximately $53 million paid
      in cash.

Stock
      Split.

On
      March 6, 2006, we issued a press release announcing that our
      Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of our outstanding shares
      of common stock to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The
      stock split will be effective on or about Thursday, April 6, 2006 for
      stockholders of record at the close of business on Friday, March 17, 2006 and
      will entitle each stockholder to receive one additional share for every
      outstanding share of common stock held. Upon the completion of the stock split,
      NVIDIA will have approximately 360 million shares of common stock
      outstanding.

Stock
      Repurchase.

On
      March
      6, 2006, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase
      in our existing stock repurchase program. We announced a $400 million
      increase to the original stock repurchase program we had announced in August
      2004. As a result of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board of
      Directors has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total
      of
      $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market,
      in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase
      transactions, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule
      10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other
      factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount
      of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.


Critical
      Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s
      discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are
      based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
      in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
      The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
      and
      judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
      cost
      of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going
      basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue
      recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, and goodwill.
      We
      base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
      that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
      which
      form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
      liabilities.

We
      believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant
      judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
      statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these
      critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our
      board
      of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating
      to
      our critical accounting policies and estimates in this report.

Revenue
      Recognition

Product
      Revenue

We
      recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
      exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable
      and
      collection is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase
      order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an
      arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and
      risk
      of loss have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether
      the
      arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably
      assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured,
      we
      defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably
      assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.

Our
      policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related
      cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product.

We
      record
      estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is
      recognized. Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed
      to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target
      markets. We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
      Issue 01-9, or EITF 01-9,

Accounting
      for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of
      the
      Vendor’s Products)

and, as
      such, we accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage
      factor. Unclaimed rebates, which historically have not been significant, are
      reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate. Rebates typically expire
      six
      months from the date of the original sale.

Our
      customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We account
      for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance
      with EITF 01-9. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, OEMs,
      distributors and add-in card partners that are earmarked for market segment
      development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’
activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. If market conditions decline,
      we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs,
      possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such
      programs are offered.

We
      also
      record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for
      estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily
      on
      historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal
      period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales
      return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for
      product returns.


License
      and Development Revenue

For
      license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual
      property components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the
      percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services
      are
      performed. For all license and service arrangements accounted for under the
      percentage-of-completion method, we determine progress to completion based
      on
      actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated
      total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically
      evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to
      complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses on
      contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can
      be
      reasonably estimated. To date, we have not recorded any such losses. Costs
      incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on
      uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue
      recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue
      recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of
      projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used
      to
      estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these
      estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize
      in
      any period.

Accounts
      Receivable

We
      maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses
      resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
      Management determines this allowance, which consists of an amount identified
      for
      specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated
      exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that
      are
      covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. If the financial condition
      of
      our customers, the financial institutions providing letters of credit, or our
      credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of
      their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that
      could
      adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance
      that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future. Our current
      credit insurance agreement expires on December 31, 2007.

As
      of
      January 29, 2006, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $0.6
      million and our gross accounts receivable balance was $330.4 million. Of the
      $330.4 million, $76.1 million was covered by credit insurance and $36.6 million
      was covered by letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers
      were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
      payments, additional allowances may be required and we may have to record
      additional reserves or write-offs on certain sales transactions in the future.
      As a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance, our allowance for
      doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 0.2% and 0.8% during fiscal
      and 2006. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross
      receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which
      balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit. As of January
      29,
      2006, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 0.2% of our
      gross accounts receivable balance. If our allowance for doubtful accounts
      receivable would have been recorded at 0.8% of our gross accounts receivable
      balance, then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at January
      29, 2006 would have been approximately $2.6 million, rather than the actual
      balance of $0.6 million.

Inventories

Inventory
      cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis (which approximates actual cost
      on an average or first-in, first-out basis). We write down our inventory for
      estimated lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal
      to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value
      based upon assumptions about future demand, future product purchase commitments,
      estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions. If actual market
      conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if our
      future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted
      future demand for such products, additional future inventory write-downs may
      be
      required that could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market
      conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margins when products
      are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact
      on
      our gross margin. As of January 29, 2006, our inventory reserve was $48.3
      million. As a percentage of our gross inventory balance, our inventory reserve
      has ranged between 8.8% and 15.9% during fiscal 2005 and 2006. As of January
      29,
      2006, our inventory reserve represented 15.9% of our gross inventory balance.
      Inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory
      has been sold or scrapped.


Income
      Taxes

Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109,

Accounting
      for Income Taxes

,
      establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of
      income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state
      and
      foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable
      or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize
      federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate,
      for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences
      and
      carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax
      assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence
      and
      judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our
      calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on
      certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in
      the
      application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax
      assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality
      to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the
      United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other
      facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential
      United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of
      whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine
      that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability
      is
      less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income
      tax
      benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements,
      accordingly.

As
      of
      January 29, 2006, we had a valuation allowance of $230.7 million. Of the total
      valuation allowance, $182.2 million is attributable to certain net operating
      loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock
      options. The tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit
      carryforwards, if and when realized, will be accounted for as a credit to
      stockholders' equity. Of the remaining valuation allowance at January 29, 2006,
      $19.5 million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in certain
      acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was
      determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to potential utilization
      limitations as a result of ownership changes; and $29.0 million relates to
      certain state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to
      be
      realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent
      realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes
      probable, recognition of these tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to
      zero,
      then reduce other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition
      to
      zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense.
      To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain state
      tax benefits becomes probable, we would recognize an income tax benefit in
      the
      period such asset is more likely than not to be realized.

Goodwill

Our
      impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in
      which the goodwill resides to its carrying value.  For the purposes of
      completing our Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS
      No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

,
      impairment test, we performed our analysis on a reporting unit
      basis.  We utilize a two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment.
      The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value-based
      test.

In
      computing fair value of our reporting units, we use estimates of future
      revenues, costs and cash flows from such units.

The
      second step, if necessary, measures the amount of such an impairment by applying
      fair value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to
      perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of
      each
      fiscal year. We completed our most recent annual impairment test during the
      fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and concluded that there was no impairment.
      However, future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings
      in
      future periods due to the potential for a write-down of goodwill in connection
      with such tests.

Revenue

During
      the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we reorganized our operating segments to
      bring
      all major product groups in line with our strategy to position ourselves as
      the
      worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor technologies. We now report
      financial information for four product-line operating segments to our Chief
      Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker,
      or CODM, as follows: the GPU Business, the MCP Business, the Handheld GPU
      Business, and the Consumer Electronics Business. Revenue in the “All Other”
category is primarily derived from sales of memory.  Please refer to Note
      15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
      information.

Fiscal
      2005 was a 53-week year, compared to fiscal 2006 and 2004 which were 52-week
      years, and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on
      our
      revenue in fiscal 2005. However, we are not able to quantify the effect of
      the
      slightly longer year on our revenue.

Fiscal
      Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005

Revenue
      was $2.4 billion for fiscal 2006, compared to $2.0 billion for fiscal 2005,
      which represents an increase of 18.2%. A discussion of our revenue results
      for
      each of our operating segments is as follows:

GPU
      Business

.
      GPU
      Business revenue increased by 22.6% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2006 compared
      to
      $1.4 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase was the result of increased sales
      of
      our GeForce 6 and GeForce 7 families of desktop GPUs that serve the high-end
      GPU
      segment, offset by a slight decline in sales of our mainstream GPU products.
      In
      addition, sales of our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products and
      notebook products continued to improve due to an increased mix of GeForce
      6-based and GeForce 7-based products, which resulted in an increase in average
      selling prices.

MCP
      Business

.
      MCP
      Business revenue was $352.3 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $175.7 million
      for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 100.6%.  The overall
      increase in MCP Business revenue is primarily due to increased sales of NVIDIA
      nForce4 products, which we began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal
      2005, and an increase in average selling prices. The overall increase was offset
      by a decrease in sales of NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce2
      products.


Handheld
      GPU Business

.
      Handheld GPU Business revenue was $58.7 million for fiscal 2006, compared to
      $45.9 million for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 27.9%.  The
      overall increase in Handheld GPU Business revenue is due to an increase in
      average selling prices of high-end feature phone products and revenue recognized
      as a result of a development contract.

Consumer
      Electronics Business

.
      Consumer Electronics Business revenue was $170.2 million for fiscal 2006,
      compared to $260.0 million for fiscal 2005, which represents a decrease of
      34.5%. The decrease in our Consumer Electronics Business is a result of
      decreased and discontinued sales of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft,
      partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual arrangement with
      SCE. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Microsoft indicated that it would
      not order any more Xbox-related products from us after our second fiscal
      quarter. As a result, the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was the last quarter
      during which we recognized revenue from the sale of our Xbox-related products
      to
      Microsoft. During fiscal 2006, we recognized $49.0 million of revenue from
      our
      contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating
      our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s
      PlayStation3. No such revenue was recognized during our fiscal 2005 as our
      definitive agreement with SCE was not executed until the first quarter of fiscal
      2006.

Fiscal
      Year 2005 vs. Fiscal Year 2004

Revenue
      was $2.0 billion in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2004, which
      represented an increase of 10.3%. Fiscal 2005 was a 53-week year, compared
      to
      fiscal 2004 which was a 52-week year.

GPU
      Business

.
      GPU
      Business revenue increased by 7.1% to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2005 compared
      to
      $1.3 billion for fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily the result of increased
      sales of our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products in fiscal 2005,
      which was due to unit sales volume increases, and an increase in average selling
      prices as a result of increased board sales. Notebook GPU sales increased in
      fiscal 2005 as a result of sales of our GeForce FX Go notebook GPU products
      outpacing the decline in our older notebook GPU product lines during the period.
      Sales of desktop products increased in fiscal 2005 as a result of a significant
      increase in sales of our high-end desktop products, offset by a slight decrease
      in mainstream desktop products. High-end desktop sales increased in fiscal
      primarily due to unit volume increases primarily related to our GeForce 6800
      and
      6600 products. The decrease in mainstream desktop sales in fiscal 2005 was
      mainly due to competitive pricing in the mainstream segment offset by the ramp
      of product sales of our GeForce 6200 with TurboCache technology during the
      fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

MCP
      Business

.
      MCP
      Business revenue increased by 8.1% to $175.7 million for fiscal 2005 compared
      to
      $162.4 million for fiscal 2004. The increase in MCP Business revenue is due
      to
      increased sales of NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 products. NVIDIA nForce4
      products began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. This increase
      was offset by a decrease in sales of NVIDIA nForce2 products.

Handheld
      GPU Business

.
      Handheld GPU Business revenue increased by 409.7% to $45.9 million for fiscal
      2005 compared to $9.0 million for fiscal 2004. The increase in handheld GPU
      sales in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to our acquisition of MediaQ, Inc. in
      the
      third quarter of fiscal 2004, which represented our initial entry into the
      handheld segment and to sales of our GoForce 4000 product.

Consumer
      Electronics Business

.
      Consumer Electronics Business revenue decreased by 7.2% to $260.0 million for
      fiscal 2005 compared to $280.1 million for fiscal 2004. The decrease in our
      Consumer Electronics Business is due to unit sales volume increases offset
      by a
      lower average sales price. Sales of our Xbox products historically fluctuated
      based on the timing of orders from Microsoft.


Concentration
      of Revenue

Revenue
      from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas
      accounted for 84%, 76% and 75% of total revenue for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries
      based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the
      foreign CEMs’, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is
      attributable to end customers in a different location. The increase in the
      percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States
      and
      other Americas for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 and for fiscal 2005
      as
      compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to decreased sales of XGPUs and MCPs
      used in the Microsoft Xbox product, which were billed to Microsoft in the United
      States.

Sales
      to
      our two largest customers accounted for approximately 26%, 31%, and 36% of
      our
      revenue during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Gross
      Profit

Gross
      profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue.
      Cost
      of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from
      subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging,
      manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such
      purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping
      costs.  Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and
      service arrangements. Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue.
      Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of
      products sold.

Our
      gross
      margin was 38.3%, 32.3% and 29.0% for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. A discussion
      of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as
      follows:

Fiscal
      Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005

GPU
      Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to
      fiscal 2005, primarily due to the sale of our GeForce 7 series GPUs and
      increased sales of our GeForce 6 series GPUs, which collectively now account
      for
      approximately 78% of our GPU Business revenue.  Our GeForce 7 and our
      GeForce 6 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our GeForce
      FX
      series GPUs which comprised 53% of our


fiscal
      2005 GPU Business revenue. In addition, average selling prices from our notebook
      GeForce 7 and GeForce 6 series GPU products increased as a larger percentage
      of
      our total notebook revenue during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal
      2005.

MCP
      Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our MCP Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to
      fiscal 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenue from sales of our NVIDIA
      nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 products, which to date have experienced higher
      gross
      margins than previous generations of NVIDIA nForce products.

Handheld
      GPU Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as
      compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the inventory write-off of certain
      handheld products in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.

Consumer
      Electronics Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business increased during fiscal 2006
      as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the reduction of die costs for
      Xbox-related products, and the recognition of revenue from our contractual
      arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating our
      next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s
      PlayStation3

.

Fiscal
      Year 2005 vs. Fiscal Year 2004

GPU
      Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to
      fiscal 2004. Our GeForce FX series of GPU products experienced lower gross
      margins than previous series of GeForce GPU products, such as the GeForce 4
      series. Company-wide efforts were made to drive down cost and improve gross
      margin and, as a result, during fiscal 2005, we were able to improve our gross
      margin. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we realized increased sales of our
      performance GeForce FX desktop GPU products and began shipping our GeForce
      series GPUs, which are among our highest gross margin products. Finally, revenue
      from our NVIDIA Quadro

professional
      workstation products, which typically provide the highest gross margins of
      any
      of our products, increased as a percentage of our total revenue during fiscal
      2005. This increase in our mix of revenue toward higher-margin products led
      to a
      positive impact on our overall gross margin.

MCP
      Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our MCP Business increased during the fiscal 2005 as compared
      fiscal 2004 primarily due to the increase in revenue from sales of our NVIDIA
      nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 products, which to date have experienced higher
      gross
      margins than our previous generations of NVIDIA nForce products.

Handheld
      GPU Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business decreased during fiscal 2005 as
      compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the inventory write-off of certain
      handheld products in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.

Consumer
      Electronics Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business decreased during fiscal 2005
      as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the pricing settlement with
      Microsoft that we announced on February 6, 2003 that related to sales of our
      Xbox related processors. In addition, during fiscal 2005 we realized a lower
      average sales price on our sales of Xbox processors.

Consolidated
      Gross Margin

The
      improvement in our gross margin reflects our continuing focus on delivering
      cost
      effective product architectures, enhancing business processes and delivering
      profitable growth.  We expect gross margin to improve by approximately 0.5%
      to 1.0% during the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

Operating
      Expenses

Research
      and Development

Research
      and development expenses increased by $17.0 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2005
      to
      fiscal 2006 primarily due to a $32.4 million increase in salaries and benefits
      related to 423 additional personnel and a $5.3 million increase in computer
      software and equipment primarily due to increased allocation of information
      technology expenses. Other expenses increased $3.9 million primarily due to
      travel and other employee related expenses associated with the


expansion
      of our international sites. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.1 million
      due to increased purchases of hardware and software equipment and facilities
      increased $0.6 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both
      of
      which were based on the growth in headcount. These increases were offset by
      an
      increase of $26.9 million in license and development project costs, primarily
      related to increased development costs related to our collaboration with SCE
      and
      other engineering costs related to a different development contract. As a
      portion of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and
      development efforts have been focusing their efforts on these development
      projects, the costs associated with these individuals are not charged to
      research and development, but were charged to cost of revenue in our
      consolidated statements of income, or were capitalized on our consolidated
      balance sheets and will be recognized as cost of revenue, on a percentage of
      completion basis.

Research
      and development expenses increased by $65.1 million, or 24%, from fiscal 2004
      to
      fiscal 2005 primarily due to a $36.0 million increase in salaries and benefits
      related to 174 additional personnel and a $10.4 million increase in new product
      development costs related to an overall increase in the number of product
      tape-outs and in prototype materials. Depreciation and amortization increased
      $11.5 million due to emulation hardware and software programs that were
      purchased during fiscal 2004, resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal
      2005 compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal 2004. Computer
      software and equipment increased $4.2 million primarily due to increased
      allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased $3.1
      million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both of which were
      based
      on the growth in headcount. Other expenses increased $1.9 million primarily
      due
      to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion
      of
      our international sites. These increases were offset by an increase of $2.0
      million in license and development project costs related to our collaboration
      with SCE that are classified as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements
      of income, or were capitalized on our consolidated balance sheets and will
      be
      recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Our collaboration with SCE
      was
      not in effect during fiscal 2004.

We
      anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research
      and
      development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in
      the
      foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of
      products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to
      fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental
      investments in research and development and these investments may be independent
      of our level of revenue.

Sales,
      General and Administrative

Sales,
      general and administrative expenses increased $3.6 million, or 2%, from fiscal
      2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a $13.8 million increase in salaries and
      benefits related to 122 additional personnel and a $6.1 million increase


in
      legal
      expenses primarily due to certain insurance reimbursements that we received
      during fiscal 2005 that reduced this expense, and increased litigation activity
      during fiscal 2006 related to 3dfx Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, and American
      Video Graphics, or AVG. In addition there were increases of $2.9 million in
      facility expense due primarily to the expansion of our international sites
      and
      $2.5 million in other general and administrative expenses, offset by a reduction
      in bad debt expense. These increases were offset by a $17.2 million decrease
      in
      advertising and promotion costs, primarily associated with a reduction in
      certain marketing programs, tradeshow expenses, new product launches and
      customer samples, other marketing costs, travel related and employee recruitment
      expenses, and by a $4.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization.

Sales,
      general and administrative expenses increased $35.6 million, or 22%, from fiscal
      2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to an $18.4 million increase in salaries
      and
      benefits related to 88 additional personnel and a $19.4 million increase in
      advertising and promotion costs for tradeshows and new product launches and
      other marketing costs, including travel and customer samples. These increases
      were offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in other expenses during the period,
      including a reduction in bad debt expense.

Operating
      Expenses

We
      anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the first quarter of
      fiscal 2007. In addition to the headcount additions that we plan to make, we
      will be adding the operating costs related to the acquisition of ULi, which
      closed on February 20, 2006. We expect that these factors will result in an
      increase in operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as compared
      to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. In addition, the first quarter of fiscal
      2007 will be the first time that we include stock-based employee compensation
      expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS
      No. 123(R),

Share-Based
      Payment

in our
      results. We anticipate that our stock-based compensation expense will be
      approximately $18 to $22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

In-process
      research and development

In
      connection with our acquisition of MediaQ in August 2003, we wrote-off $3.5
      million of in-process research and development expense, or IPR&D, that had
      not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.
      In
      accordance with SFAS No. 2,

Accounting
      for Research and Development Costs

,
      as
      clarified by FIN 4,

Applicability
      of SFAS No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method

      interpretation of SFAS No. 2

, amounts
      assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria must be charged to
      expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price.

Settlement
      Costs

Settlement
      costs were $14.2 million for fiscal 2006.  The settlement costs are
      associated with two litigation matters, 3dfx and AVG.  AVG is settled. The
      3dfx matter is not finally settled and is subject to judicial review and the
      completion of appropriate procedures and documents. However, based on the
      potential settlement in this case, we have concluded that a loss is probable
      and
      that we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss.  Please refer to Note
      11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
      information.

Interest
      Income and Interest Expense

Interest
      income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable
      securities. Interest income increased from $11.4 million to $20.7 million from
      fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the result of higher average
      balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest
      rates in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005. Interest income decreased
      from $18.6 million to $11.4 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily
      due to the result of lower overall balances of cash, cash equivalents and
      marketable securities and due to lower market interest rates.

Interest
      expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease
      obligations and, prior to the redemption in October 2003, interest on the
      convertible subordinated debentures, or the Notes. Interest expense decreased
      from $12.0 million to $0.2 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. The decrease
      was primarily due to the redemption of the Notes.


Other
      Income (Expense), net

Other
      income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale
      of marketable securities. Other income decreased by $1.1 million
      from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the liquidation of
      marketable securities during fiscal 2006 in order to obtain the cash needed
      for
      the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation
      Act of 2004. Other income decreased by $2.4 million from fiscal 2004 to
      fiscal 2005 primarily due to $2.5 million of realized gains on the sale of
      marketable securities during fiscal 2004 as a result of our liquidation of
      a
      significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain
      the cash required to redeem the Notes in October 2003. This decrease was offset
      by a $1.0 million realized gain during fiscal 2005 related to the receipt of
      cash and marketable securities as part of an investment exchange.

Income
      Taxes

We
      recognized income tax expense of $57.6 million, $25.1 million, and $12.3 million
      in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage
      of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 16.0% in fiscal
      2006, 20.0% in fiscal 2005, and 14.1% in fiscal 2004.

The
      difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years is primarily
      attributable to changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax.

Please
      refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
      information regarding the components of our income tax expense.

Convertible
      Debenture Redemption Expense

On
      October 24, 2003, we fully redeemed the Notes. The aggregate principal amount
      of
      the Notes outstanding was $300.0 million, which included $18.6 million of Notes
      that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended October
      26, 2003. The redemption price was equal to approximately 102.7% of the
      outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest
      up
      to, but excluding, the redemption date. In connection with the redemption of
      the
      Notes, we recorded a one-time charge in fiscal 2004 of approximately $13.1
      million, which included a $7.6 million redemption premium and $5.5 million
      of
      unamortized issuance costs.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

As
      of
      January 29, 2006, we had $950.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
      securities, an increase of $280.1 million from the end of fiscal 2005.

As
      of
      January 30, 2005, we had $670.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
      securities, an increase of $66.0 million from the end of fiscal 2004.

Our
      portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several
      financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier
      investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain
      limits on our portfolio duration.

Operating
      activities generated cash of $446.4 million, $132.2 million, and $49.7 million
      during fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The increase in cash flows
      from operating activities in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 was
      primarily related to the $202.2 million increase in net income and changes
      in
      operating assets and liabilities. On our consolidated balance sheet, accrued
      liabilities increased $77.2 million primarily due to the recording of income
      taxes payable for fiscal 2006, the increase in accruals related to customer
      programs and the recording of $30.6 million in relation to 3dfx, of which $25.0
      million was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. Accounts payable decreased
      $58.8 million and inventories decreased $60.7 million primarily as a result
      of
      significant reductions in older products, offset by an increase in new products.
      Accounts receivable increased $21.9 million primarily due to increased sales
      and
      improved linearity of sales, and cash collections during the fourth quarter
      of
      fiscal 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

The
      increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2005 when compared
      to
      fiscal 2004 was primarily related to the $25.9 million increase in net income
      and changes in operating assets and liabilities. On our consolidated balance
      sheet, accrued liabilities increased $37.3 million


primarily
      due to an increase in rebates payable, which resulted from increased OEM
      business. Accounts payable increased $52.9 million primarily due to purchases
      from subcontract manufacturers for inventory. Offsetting these increases, our
      accounts receivable increased $99.6 million primarily due to increased sales
      during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the fourth quarter
      of
      fiscal 2004.

Investing
      activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable
      securities, and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold
      improvements for our facilities, and intangible assets. Investing activities
      used cash of $41.8 million and $152.0 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005,
      respectively. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2006 was
      primarily due to $79.6 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable
      to purchases of new research and development equipment, hardware equipment,
      technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold improvements
      at
      our headquarters facility in Santa Clara, California and at our international
      sites. In addition, we used cash of $12.1 million to acquire certain assets
      of a
      private company and $9.7 million related to investments we made during fiscal
      2006 in non-affiliated companies. These uses of cash were offset by $59.6
      million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.

Investing
      activities used cash of $152.0 million and provided cash of $88.0 million during
      fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities during
      fiscal 2005 was primarily due to $84.7 million of net purchases of marketable
      securities. In addition, we used $67.3 million for capital expenditures
      primarily attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements for our new data
      center at our headquarters campus, new research and development emulation
      equipment, technology licenses, software and intangible assets.

We
      expect
      to spend approximately $80 million to $100 million for capital expenditures
      during fiscal 2007, primarily for purchases of software licenses, emulation
      equipment, computers and engineering workstations. In addition, we may continue
      to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets.

Financing
      activities used cash of $61.4 million during fiscal 2006 compared to cash
      provided of $13.8 million during fiscal 2005. Cash used in fiscal 2006 primarily
      resulted from $188.5 million related to our stock repurchase program, offset
      by
      $127.5 million of common stock issued under employee stock plans. In fiscal
      2005, the cash provided was primarily from $42.5 million of common stock issued
      under employee stock plans, offset by $24.6 million related to our stock
      repurchase program.

Financing
      activities provided cash of $13.8 million during fiscal 2005 compared to cash
      used of $270.3 million during fiscal 2004. Cash provided in fiscal 2005
      primarily resulted from $42.5 million of common stock issued under employee
      stock plans, offset by $24.6 million related to our stock repurchase program.
      In
      fiscal 2004, the cash used was primarily due to the $300.0 million redemption
      of
      the Notes, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased during
      the three months ended October 26, 2003.

Stock
      Repurchase Program

On
      August
      9, 2004 we announced that our Board of Directors, or the Board, had authorized
      a
      stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject
      to
      certain specifications, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $300.0 million.
      As
      part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into and we may continue
      to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial
      institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front
      payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our
      common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number
      of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of
      the
      term of the agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repurchased
      1.3 million shares of our common stock for $50.0 million under a structured
      share repurchase transaction, which we recorded on the trade date of the
      transaction. Through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we have
      repurchased 8.5 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total
      cost of $213.2 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we entered
      into
      a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common
      stock for $50.0 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first
      fiscal quarter.

On
      March
      6, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an increase
      in our existing stock repurchase program. We announced a $400 million
      increase to the original stock repurchase program we had announced in August
      2004. As a result of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board of
      Directors has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total
      of
      $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market,
      in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase
      transactions, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule
      10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other
      factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount
      of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.


Operating
      Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements

We
      believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from
      operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital
      requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance
      that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this
      time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or
      at
      all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require
      additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are
      unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital
      equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm
      our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from
      operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital
      include:

·

decreased
      demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products;

·

inability
      to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation
      products;

·

competitive
      pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;
      and

·

new
      product announcements or product introductions by our competitors.

For
      additional factors see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Operations
      - Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our
      operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or
      investors, our stock price could decline.”

Shelf
      Registration Statement

In
      December 2003, we filed a Form S-3 with the SEC under its "shelf" registration
      process. This shelf registration was declared effective by the SEC on March
      25,
      2004. Under this shelf registration statement, we may sell common stock,
      preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stock purchase contracts and/or
      stock purchase units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of
      $500.0 million. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus
      supplement, we intend to use the proceeds for working capital and general
      corporate purposes.

3dfx
      Asset Purchase

The
      3dfx
      asset purchase closed on April 18, 2001. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase
      Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less
      $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated
      December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the
      other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts
      and
      other liabilities had been provided for, then we would have been obligated
      to
      pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx could not make
      such
      a certification, but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities
      could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx could have elected
      to
      receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and
      a
      reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated
      by
      dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that
      all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for, or could not be
      satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the
      agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. In October 2002,
      3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy
      Court for the Northern District of California. In March 2003, we were served
      with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court which
      sought, among other things, payments from us as additional purchase price
      related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx. In early November 2005,
      after
      many months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured
      Creditors of 3dfx reached a conditional settlement of the Trustee’s claims
      against NVIDIA. This conditional settlement, which will be subject to the review
      and approval of the Bankruptcy Court, calls for a payment of approximately
      $30.6
      million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million relates to
      various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million relates
      to
      the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured
      creditors of 3dfx. As such, during the three months ended October 30, 2005,
      we
      recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as
      additional purchase price for 3dfx. Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this
      litigation.

We

      no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K
      303(a)(4)(ii).

Recently
      Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
      December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
      Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
      Payment

,
      which
      requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
      stock-based compensation payments. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective
      date of SFAS No. 123(R), which is now effective for annual periods that begin
      after June 15, 2005. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
      No.
      107, or SAB No. 107, which includes interpretive guidance for the initial
      implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) allows for either prospective
      recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition. We intend
      to
      adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires
      the
      application of the accounting standard as of January 30, 2006, the first day
      of
      our fiscal 2007. Expensing these incentives in future periods will materially
      and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stock-based
      compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings.
      We
      anticipate that our stock-based compensation expense will be approximately
      $18
      to $22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and we are unsure how the
      market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results, which could
      impact our stock price.

During
      the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we transitioned from a Black-Scholes model
      to
      a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock-based
      compensation awards granted under our stock option plans. As a result of recent
      regulatory guidance, including SAB No. 107, and in anticipation of the impending
      effective date of SFAS No. 123(R), we reevaluated the assumptions we use to
      estimate the value of employee stock options and shares issued under our
      employee stock purchase plan, beginning with stock options granted and shares
      issued under our employee stock purchase plan in our first quarter of fiscal
      2006. We determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more
      reflective of market conditions and, therefore, can reasonably be expected
      to be
      a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility.
      Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we began segregating options
      into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in
      order
      to make full use of the capabilities of the binomial valuation model. As such,
      the expected term is based on detailed historical data about employees' exercise
      behavior, vesting schedules, and death and disability probabilities. We believe
      the resulting binomial calculation provides a more refined estimate of the
      fair
      value of our employee stock options. For our employee stock purchase plan,
      we
      decided to continue to use the Black-Scholes model to calculate the estimated
      fair value.

In
      June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, or SFAS No. 154,

Accounting
      Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
      Statement No. 3

.
      SFAS
      No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes


in
      accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and
      reporting of a change in accounting principle. We will adopt SFAS 154
      during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
      No. 154 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position,
      results of operations or cash flows.

In
      June
      2005, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force’s, or EITF’s, Issue
      No. 05-06, or EITF No. 05-06,

Determining
      the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements

.
      EITF
      No. 05-06 provides that the amortization period used for leasehold improvements
      acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease
      be the shorter of (a) the useful life of the assets or (b) a term that
      includes required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured upon
      the acquisition or the purchase. The provisions of EITF No. 05-06 are effective
      on a prospective basis for leasehold improvements purchased or acquired. We
      adopted EITF No. 05-06 during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and it did
      not
      have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
      operations or cash flows.

In
      November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position, or FSP, FAS115-1/124-1,

The
      Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
      Investments

,
      which
      addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired,
      whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an
      impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations
      subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires
      certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as
      other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in this FSP amends SFAS
      No. 115,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

,
      and
      SFAS No. 124,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations

,
      and APB
      Opinion No. 18,

The
      Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

. We
      will adopt this FSP during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We do not
      believe the adoption of this FSP will

have
      a
      material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
      or
      cash flows.

In
      November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS123(R)-3,

Transition
      Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.

This
      FSP
      requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the
      additional-paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
      Payment

,
      or the
      alternative transition method as described in the FSP. An entity that adopts
      SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application may make a
      one-time election to adopt the transition method described in this FSP. An
      entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of SFAS
      No. 123(R) or the effective date of this FSP to evaluate its available
      transition alternatives and make its one-time election. This FSP became
      effective in November 2005. We are currently evaluating the impact that the
      adoption of this FSP could have on our

consolidated
      financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM
      7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest
      Rate Risk

We
      invest
      in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments
      in
      commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of
      corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies.
      These investments are denominated in United States dollars.

We
      account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.
      All of
      the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and
      floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate
      risk.
      Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to
      a
      rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income
      than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future
      investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
      rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities
      that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because
      we classify our debt securities as “available-for-sale”, no gains or losses are
      recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold
      prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than
      temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related
      unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income,
      a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax.


As
      of
      January 29, 2006, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed
      rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the
      yield curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values
      for
      these investments of approximately $2.6 million.

Exchange
      Rate Risk

We
      consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be
      minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers
      provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are
      not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United
      States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more
      expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely,
      decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies
      could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing
      business with us. To date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging
      activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency
      exchange rates could harm our business in the future.

Disclosure
      Controls and Procedures

Based
      on
      their evaluation as of January 29, 2006, our management, including our Chief
      Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our
      disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure
      that the material information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual
      Report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
      the
      time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
      instructions for Form 10-K.

Management’s
      Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
      Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
      management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
      we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting as of January 29, 2006 based on the criteria set forth
      in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
      on
      our evaluation under the criteria set forth in

Internal
      Control — Integrated Framework

,
      our
      management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
      effective as of January 29, 2006.

Our
      management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting as of January 29, 2006 has been audited by
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
      as
      stated in their report which is included herein.


Changes
      in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There
      were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our
      last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
      to
      materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
      Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our
      management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
      does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
      controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter
      how
      well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
      assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
      of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
      and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
      of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
      can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
      if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
      the
      Stockholders and Board of Directors

NVIDIA
      Corporation:

We
      have
      completed integrated audits of NVIDIA Corporation’s fiscal 2006 and 2005
      consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
      reporting as of January 29, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the Public
      Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on
      our
      audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
      financial statements and financial statement schedule

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing
      under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
      position of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries at January 29, 2006 and
      January 30, 2005 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
      each of the two years in the period ended January 29, 2006 in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
      addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
      appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
      information set forth therein as of January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005 and
      for each of the two years in the period ended January 29, 2006 when read in
      conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
      statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
      Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
      financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
      statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
      perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
      includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
      disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
      used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal
      control over financial reporting

Also,
      in
      our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Annual Report on
      Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
      Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
      January 29, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
      Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006,
      based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
      internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
      is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of
      the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
      conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
      with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
      States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
      reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
      reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control
      over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
      evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
      performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
      We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,


accurately
      and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
      company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
      as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
      of
      the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
      and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
      regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
      or
      disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
      financial statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
      Board
      of Directors and Stockholders

NVIDIA
      Corporation:

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity
      and comprehensive income, and cash flows of NVIDIA Corporation and subsidiaries
      (the “Company”) for the year ended January 25, 2004. In connection with our
      audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the
      financial statement schedule for the year ended January 25, 2004 as listed
      in
      the index of Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial
      statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
      statements and financial statement schedule based on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit

in
      accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
      (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
      to
      obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
      of
      material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
      supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
      also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
      made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
      presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
      opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the results of operations and the cash flows of NVIDIA
      Corporation and subsidiaries for the year ended January 25, 2004 in conformity
      with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
      related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
      consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
      material respects, the information set forth therein.

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
      1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
      Policies

Our
      Company

NVIDIA
      Corporation is the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor
      technologies. Our products enhance the end-user experience on consumer and
      professional computing devices. We have four major product-line operating
      segments: graphics processing units, or GPUs, media and communications
      processors, or MCPs, Handheld GPUs, and Consumer Electronics. Our GPU Business
      is composed of products that support desktop personal computers, or PCs,
      notebook PCs and professional workstations; our MCP Business is composed of
      NVIDIA nForce products that operate as a single-chip or chipset that can
      off-load system functions, such as audio processing and network communications,
      and perform these operations independently from the host central processing
      unit, or CPU; our Handheld GPU Business is composed of products that support
      handheld personal digital assistants, cellular phones and other handheld
      devices; and our Consumer Electronics Business is concentrated in products
      that
      support video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices
      and
      is composed of our contractual arrangements with Sony Computer Entertainment,
      or
      SCE, to jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce
      GPU and SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s PlayStation3, sales of our Xbox-related
      products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft relating to the
      successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the Xbox360, and related
      devices, and digital media processor products.

We
      were
      incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in
      April
      1998. Our headquarter facilities are in Santa Clara, California.

Fiscal
      year

We
      operate on a 52 or 53-week year, ending on the Sunday nearest January 31. Fiscal
      2006 and 2004 were 52-week years, compared to fiscal 2005 which was a
      53-week year.

Reclassifications

Certain
      prior fiscal year balances were reclassified to conform to the current fiscal
      year presentation.

Principles
      of Consolidation

Our
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation
      and
      its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and
      transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use
      of Estimates

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
      and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
      and
      disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
      statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
      period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an on-going basis,
      we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,
      accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes and contingencies. These
      estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that
      we
      believe are reasonable.

Cash
      and Cash Equivalents

We
      consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity
      of
      three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of
      January 29, 2006, our cash and cash equivalents were $551.8 million, which
      includes $256.6 million invested in money market funds.


NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Marketable
      Securities

We
      account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

All of
      our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Cash equivalents consist of financial
      instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities
      of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Marketable securities
      consist primarily of highly liquid investments with a maturity of greater than
      three months when purchased and some equity investments. We classify our
      marketable securities at the date of acquisition in the available-for-sale
      category as our intention is to convert them into cash for operations. These
      securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and
      losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component
      of
      stockholders’ equity, net of tax. We follow the guidance provided by Emerging
      Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-01,

The
      Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
      Investments

,
      in
      order to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are
      other
      than temporarily impaired. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable
      securities are determined using the specific-identification method.

Inventories

Inventory
      cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis (which approximates actual cost
      on an average or first-in, first-out basis). Inventory costs consist primarily
      of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer
      fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs,
      including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield
      fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. We write down our inventory
      for estimated amounts related to lower of cost or market, obsolescence or
      unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
      and
      the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, future
      product purchase commitments, estimated manufacturing yield levels and market
      conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
      by management, or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers
      exceed our forecasted future demand for such products, additional future
      inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating
      results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher
      gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not
      had a significant impact on our gross margin. Inventory reserves once
      established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or
      scrapped.

Property
      and Equipment

Property
      and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
      straight-line method based on estimated useful lives, generally three to five
      years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under
      capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases
      are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life
      of
      the asset.

Debt
      Financing Costs

In
      connection with the issuance of the convertible subordinated debentures, see
      Note 11, we incurred certain direct issuance costs from third parties who
      performed services that assisted in the closing of the transaction. These
      issuance costs were included in our consolidated balance sheets under “deposits
      and other assets” and were amortized on a straight line basis over the term of
      the financing. On October 24, 2003, we fully redeemed the Notes. In connection
      with the redemption, we recorded a $13.1 million charge in fiscal 2004, which
      included the write-off of $5.5 million of unamortized issuance
      costs.


NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Advertising
      Expenses

We
      expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising
      expenses for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $9.2 million, $15.2 million,
      and
      $11.3 million, respectively.

Revenue
      Recognition

Product
      Revenue

We
      recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
      exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable
      and
      collection is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase
      order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an
      arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and
      risk
      of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms. At the point
      of
      sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and
      whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of
      a
      fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the
      time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt
      of
      cash.

Our
      policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related
      cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product.

We
      record
      estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is
      recognized. Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed
      to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target
      markets. We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
      Issue 01-9, or EITF 01-9,

Accounting
      for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of
      the
      Vendor’s Products)

and, as
      such, we accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage
      factor. Unclaimed rebates, which historically have not been significant, are
      reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate. Rebates typically expire
      six
      months from the date of the original sale.

Our
      customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We account
      for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance
      with EITF 01-9. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders,
      original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, distributors and add-in card partners
      that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically
      are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA
      products. If market conditions decline, we may take actions to increase amounts
      offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction
      of revenue at the time such programs are offered.

We
      also
      record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for
      estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily
      on
      historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal
      period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales
      return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for
      product returns.

License
      and Development Revenue

For
      license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual
      property components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the
      percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services
      are
      performed. For all license and service arrangements accounted for under the
      percentage-of-completion method, we determine progress to completion based
      on
      actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated
      total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically
      evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to
      complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses on
      contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can
      be
      reasonably estimated. To date, we have not recorded any such losses. Costs
      incurred in advance of revenue recognized are


NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

recorded
      as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the
      amount of revenue recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue.
      Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion
      of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are
      used
      to estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these
      estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize
      in
      any period.

Concentration
      of Credit Risk

Financial
      instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist
      primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts
      receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment
      grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our
      portfolio duration. All marketable securities are held in our name, managed
      by
      several investment managers and held by one major financial institution under
      a
      custodial arrangement. One customer accounted for approximately 11% of our
      accounts receivable balance at January 29, 2006. We perform ongoing credit
      evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for
      potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for
      specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our
      overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and
      letters of credit.

Impairment
      of Long-Lived Assets

In
      accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, or
      SFAS No. 144,

Accounting
      for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

long-lived
      assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to
      amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
      circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
      recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
      comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future
      cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of
      an
      asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is
      recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
      the
      fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined based on the estimated
      discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Assets
      and
      liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated
      balance sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying
      amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.

Rent
      Expense

We
      recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and have
      accrued for rent expense incurred, but not paid.

Accounting
      for Asset Retirement Obligations

In
      fiscal
      2004, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, or SFAS
      No. 143,

Accounting
      for Asset Retirement Obligations

,
      which
      addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with
      the
      retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
      costs. SFAS No. 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement
      of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development
      and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value
      of a
      liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in
      which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The
      fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated
      asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the
      asset. During fiscal 2005, we completed leasehold improvements at our
      headquarters facility in Santa Clara, California and recorded a liability of
      $4.5 million to return the property to its original condition upon lease
      termination in fiscal year 2013.

During
      fiscal 2006, we continued the expansion of our international facilities, and
      completed leasehold improvements at our international sites. As a result, we
      recorded an additional liability of $2.0 million, of which $0.2 million relates
      to accretion expense, to return the properties at these sites to their original
      condition upon lease termination.


NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Income
      Taxes

Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109,

Accounting
      for Income Taxes

,
      establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of
      income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state
      and
      foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable
      or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize
      federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate,
      for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences
      and
      carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax
      assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence
      and
      judgment, are not expected to be realized.

Our
      calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on
      certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in
      the
      application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax
      assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality
      to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the
      United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other
      facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential
      United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of
      whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine
      that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability
      is
      less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income
      tax
      benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements,
      accordingly.

Fair
      Value of Financial Instruments

The
      carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
      and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively
      short maturities as of January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005. Marketable
      securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported
      at
      fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
      other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, net of
      tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted
      market prices.

Foreign
      Currency Translation

We
      use
      the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries.
      Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United
      States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and
      liabilities, including inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets,
      property and equipment, deposits and other assets and equity, are remeasured
      at
      historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average
      exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related
      to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at
      historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement
      are included in “Other income (expense), net” and to date have not been
      significant.

Comprehensive
      Income

Comprehensive
      income consists of net income and other comprehensive income or loss. Other
      comprehensive income or loss components include unrealized gains or losses
      on
      available-for-sale securities, net of tax.

Goodwill

We
      account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

.
      As
      required by SFAS No. 142, we discontinued amortizing the


NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

remaining
      balances of goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. All remaining and
      future acquired goodwill will be subject to our annual impairment test during
      our fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential
      impairment exist, using a fair value-based approach. Our impairment review
      process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill
      resides to its carrying value. For the purposes of completing our SFAS
      No. 142  i

mpairment
      test, we performed our analysis on a reporting unit
      basis.

We utilize a two-step approach to testing goodwill for
      impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair
      value-based test. In computing fair value of our reporting units, we use
      estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows from such units. The second
      step, if necessary, measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair
      value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to perform
      our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
      year. We completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth
      quarter of fiscal 2006 and concluded that there was no impairment. However,
      future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings due to the
      potential for a write-down of goodwill in connection with such
      tests.

Stock-Based
      Compensation

Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, or SFAS No. 148,

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure

,
      amends
      the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      123, or SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation,

to
      require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
      statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based compensation
      and
      the effect of the method used on reported results.

We
      use
      the intrinsic value method, as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
      No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

to
      account for our stock-based employee compensation plans. As such, compensation
      expense is recorded if on the date of grant the current fair value per share
      of
      the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price per share. We recognize
      compensation cost for awards with pro rata vesting on a straight-line basis.
      Compensation cost for our stock-based compensation plans as determined
      consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

      the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we transitioned from a Black-Scholes model
      to
      a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock-based
      compensation awards granted under our stock option plans.  As a result of
      recent regulatory guidance, including SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107,
      or
      SAB No. 107, and in anticipation of the impending effective date of Financial

      stock purchase plan in our first quarter of fiscal 2006.  We determined
      that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market
      conditions and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator
      of expected volatility than historical volatility. Additionally, in the first
      quarter of fiscal 2006, we began segregating options into groups for employees
      with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to make full use of
      the
      capabilities of the binomial valuation model.  As such, the expected term
      is based on detailed historical data about employees' exercise behavior, vesting
      schedules, and death and disability probabilities.  We believe the
      resulting binomial calculation provides a more refined estimate of the fair
      value of our employee stock options. For our employee stock purchase plan,
      we
      decided to continue to use the Black-Scholes model to calculate the estimated
      fair value.

For
      the
      purpose of the pro forma calculation, the fair value of stock options granted
      under our stock option plans and the fair value of shares issued under our
      employee stock purchase plan have been estimated with the following
      assumptions:

For
      the
      purpose of the pro forma calculation, the weighted average per share fair value
      of options granted during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $10.87,
      $14.10, and $9.43, respectively. For the purpose of the pro forma calculation,
      the weighted average fair value of shares purchased under the employee stock
      purchase plan during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $3.44, $5.28,
      and $3.76, respectively.

Net
      Income Per Share

Basic
      net
      income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
      outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using
      the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares
      outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the
      treasury stock method, the effect of stock options outstanding is not included
      in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect
      is anti-dilutive. The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and
      denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for
      the
      periods presented:

Diluted
      net income per share does not include the effect of the following anti-dilutive
      common equivalent shares of stock options outstanding of 5.8 million, 13.7
      million, and 7.9 million for the fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
      The
      weighted average price of stock options excluded from the computation of diluted
      earnings per share was $35.58, $27.86, and $29.63 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and
      2004, respectively.

Recently
      Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
      December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
      Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
      Payment

,
      which
      requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
      stock-based compensation payments. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective
      date of SFAS No. 123(R), which is now effective for annual periods that begin
      after June 15, 2005. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
      No.
      107, or SAB No. 107, which includes interpretive guidance for the initial
      implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) allows for either prospective
      recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition. We intend
      to
      adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires
      the
      application of the accounting standard as of January 30, 2006, the first day
      of
      our fiscal 2007. Expensing these incentives in future periods will materially
      and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stock-based
      compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings.
      We
      anticipate that our stock-based compensation expense will be approximately
      $18
      to $22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and we are unsure how the
      market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results, which could
      impact our stock price. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior
      periods, the magnitude of the impact of that standard would have approximated
      the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation,

assuming
      the application of the Black-Scholes model as described in the disclosure of
      pro
      forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share in Note 1
      of
      the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading “Stock-Based
      Compensation.” SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions
      in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash
      flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current
      literature.

In
      June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, or SFAS No. 154,

Accounting
      Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
      Statement No. 3

.
      SFAS
      No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes
      the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
      principle. We will adopt SFAS 154 during the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
      We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material impact on
      our
      consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
        June
        2005, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force’s, or EITF’s, Issue No.
        05-06, or EITF No. 05-06, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold
        Improvements. EITF No. 05-06 provides that the amortization period used for
        leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after
        the
        inception of a lease be the shorter of (a) the useful life of the assets
        or (b)
        a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably
        assured upon the acquisition or the purchase. The provisions of EITF No.
        05-06
        are effective on a prospective basis for leasehold improvements purchased
        or
        acquired. We adopted EITF No. 05-06 during the second quarter of fiscal 2006
        and
        it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position,
        results of operations or cash flows.

In
        November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position, or FSP, FAS115-1/124-1, The
        Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
        Investments, which addresses the determination as to when an investment is
        considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and
        the
        measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting
        considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary
        impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that
        have
        not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in
        this
        FSP amends SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
        Securities, and SFAS No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by
        Not-for-Profit Organizations, and APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of
        Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. This FSP is effective for reporting
        periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption
        of
        this FSP will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position,
        results of operations or cash flows.

In
        November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS123(R)-3, Transition Election to
        Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. This FSP requires
        an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the
        additional-paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based
        Payment, or the alternative transition method as described in the FSP. An
        entity
        that adopts SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application may
        make
        a one-time election to adopt the transition method described in this FSP.
        An
        entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of
        SFAS
        No. 123(R) or the effective date of this FSP to evaluate its available
        transition alternatives and make its one-time election. This FSP became
        effective in November 2005. We continue to evaluate the impact that the adoption
        of this FSP could have on our consolidated financial position, results of
        operations or cash flows.

Note
      2 - Acquisition of MediaQ, Inc.

On
      August
      19, 2003, we completed the acquisition of MediaQ, Inc., or MediaQ, a leading
      provider of graphics and multimedia technology for wireless mobile devices.
      Our
      primary reasons for the acquisition of MediaQ, Inc. were to accelerate our
      entry
      into the handheld devices market, use MediaQ’s two-dimensional, or 2D, and low
      power capabilities, allowing us to continue to focus on three-dimensional,
      or
      3D, and advanced video efforts, use existing MediaQ channel and design wins,
      and
      enhance MediaQ’s PDA business through our existing OEM and original design
      manufacturer channels.

The
      aggregate purchase price consisted of cash consideration of approximately $71.3
      million, including $1.3 million of direct acquisition costs and $3.5 million
      of
      in-process research and development, or IPR&D, The amount of the IPR&D
      represents the value assigned to research and development projects of MediaQ
      that had commenced but had not yet reached technological feasibility and had
      no
      alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No. 2,

Accounting
      for Research and Development Costs

,
      as
      clarified by FIN 4,

      amounts
      assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria were charged to expense
      as part of the allocation of the purchase price.

The
      pro
      forma results of operations have not been presented for the acquisition of
      MediaQ because the effect of this acquisition was not considered
      material.

Note
      3 - 3dfx

During
      fiscal year 2002, we completed the purchase of certain assets from 3dfx
      Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
      $74.2 million. The 3dfx asset purchase was accounted for under the purchase
      method of accounting and closed on April 18, 2001. Under the terms of the Asset
      Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million,
      less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated
      December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the
      other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts
      and
      other liabilities had been provided for, then we

would
      have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock.
      If
      3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly certified that
      its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then
      3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such
      debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock, with
      such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share.
      If
      3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided
      for, or could not be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, we would not be
      obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the
      assets.

In
      October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United
      States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. In March 2003,
      we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy
      Court which sought, among other things, payments from us as additional purchase
      price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx. In early November
      2005,
      after many months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured
      Creditors of 3dfx reached a conditional settlement of the Trustee’s claims
      against NVIDIA. This conditional settlement, which will be subject to the review
      and approval of the Bankruptcy Court, calls for a payment of approximately
      $30.6
      million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million relates to
      various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million relates
      to
      the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured
      creditors of 3dfx. As such, during the three months ended October 30, 2005,
      we
      recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as
      additional purchase price for 3dfx. Please see Note 11 for further information
      regarding this litigation.

The
      3dfx
      asset purchase price of $95.0 million and $4.2 million of direct transaction
      costs were allocated based on fair values presented below.

      for
      under the purchase method of accounting and closed on December 30, 2005. During
      the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded $25.0 million as goodwill related
      to the purchase of certain assets of 3dfx. Please refer to Note 3 of the Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  In fiscal
      2005, the amount allocated to MediaQ goodwill was adjusted to $52,913 as a
      result of additional information that became available. This information was
      primarily related to liabilities that were less than originally estimated at
      the
      time of acquisition.

During
      fiscal 2005, in conjunction with the reorganization of our business reporting
      units, we reassigned goodwill to our reporting units using a relative fair
      value allocation approach. In computing fair value of our reporting units,
      we
      use estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows from such units. The
      amount of goodwill allocated to our GPU, MCP, Handheld GPU, Consumer
      Electronics, and All Other segments as of January 29, 2006, was $99.3 million,
      $15.1 million, $12.7 million, $11.9 million, and $6.3 million,

      Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

All of
      our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Cash equivalents consist of financial
      instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities
      of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Marketable securities
      consist primarily of highly liquid investments with a maturity of greater than
      three months when purchased and some equity investments. We classify our
      marketable securities at the date of acquisition in the available-for-sale
      category as our intention is to convert them into cash for operations. These
      securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and
      losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component
      of
      stockholders’ equity, net of tax. Realized gains and losses on the sale of
      marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method.
      Net realized losses for fiscal 2006 and 2005 were $2.8 million and $0.4 million,
      respectively. Net realized gains for fiscal 2004 were $2.9 million.

As
      of
      January 29, 2006, we had 143 investments that were in an unrealized loss
      position with an average unrealized loss duration of less than one year. The
      gross unrealized losses related to fixed income securities were due to changes
      in interest rates. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on
      investment securities at January 29, 2006 are temporary in nature. We review
      our
      investments to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of
      possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is
      temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been
      less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of
      the
      investee, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of
      time
      sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Our investment
      policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the
      diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration.

The
      amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable
      securities classified as available-for-sale at January 29, 2006 and January
      30,
      2005 by contractual maturity are shown below.

All
      of
      our marketable securities are debt instruments with the exception of $0.9
      million of publicly traded equity securities at January 30,
      2005.

In
      connection with certain agreements that we have executed in the past, we have
      at
      times provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such
      as
      tax, product and employee liabilities. We have also on occasion included
      intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related
      agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be
      estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated
      liability. As such, we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated
      financial statements for such indemnifications.

Note

Stock
      Repurchase Program

On
      August
      9, 2004 we announced that our Board of Directors, or the Board, had authorized
      a
      stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject
      to
      certain specifications, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $300.0 million.
      As
      part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into and we may continue
      to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial
      institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front
      payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our
      common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number
      of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of
      the
      term of the agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repurchased
      1.3 million shares of our common stock for $50.0 million under a structured
      share repurchase transaction, which we recorded on the trade date of the
      transaction. Through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we have
      repurchased 8.5 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total
      cost of $213.2 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we entered
      into
      a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common
      stock for $50.0 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first
      fiscal quarter.

On
      March
      6, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an increase
      in our existing stock repurchase program. We announced a $400 million
      increase to the original stock repurchase program we had announced in August
      2004. As a result of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board of
      Directors has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total
      of
      $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market,
      in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase
      transactions, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule
      10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other
      factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount
      of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

      Preferred Stock

As

      January 29, 2006, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

      Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan

On
      August
      1, 2000, our Board of Directors approved the 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive
      Plan, or the 2000 Plan, to provide for the issuance of our common stock to
      employees and affiliates who are not directors, officers or 10% stockholders.
      The 2000 Plan provides for the issuance of nonstatutory stock options, stock
      bonuses and restricted stock purchase rights. Option grants issued under the
      2000 plan generally expire in six to 10 years. The Compensation Committee
      appointed by the Board of Directors has the authority to amend the 2000 Plan
      and
      to determine the option term, exercise price and vesting period of each grant.
      Initial option grants generally vest ratably over a four-year period, with
      25%
      becoming vested approximately one year from the date of grant and the remaining

75%
      vesting on a quarterly basis over the next three years. Subsequent option grants
      generally vest quarterly over a three-year period. There were a total of
      21,939,202 shares authorized for issuance and 10,595,890 shares available for
      future issuance under the 2000 Plan as of January 29, 2006.

      Equity Incentive Plan

The
      Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1998 Plan, was adopted by our Board of Directors
      on February 17, 1998 and was approved by our stockholders on April 6, 1998
      as an amendment and restatement of our then existing Equity Incentive Plan
      which
      had been adopted on May 21, 1993. The 1998 Plan provides for the issuance of
      our
      common stock to directors, employees and consultants. The 1998 Plan was
      subsequently amended on March 7, 2006. The 1998 Plan provides for the issuance
      of stock bonuses, restricted stock purchase rights, incentive stock options
      or
      nonstatutory stock options. There were a total of 110,094,385 shares authorized
      for issuance and 5,059,598 shares available for future issuance under the 1998
      Plan as of January 29, 2006.

Pursuant
      to the 1998 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options is at least
      100% of the fair market value on the date of grant or for employees owning
      in
      excess of 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock, 110% of the fair
      market value on the date of grant. For nonstatutory stock options, the exercise
      price is no less than 85% of the fair market value on the date of grant.

Option
      grants issued under the 1998 Plan generally expire in six to ten years. Vesting
      periods are determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee
      of the Board of Directors. Initial option grants made after February 10, 2004
      under the 1998 Plan generally vest ratably each quarter over a three year
      period. Subsequent option grants are generally granted for performance and
      generally vest quarterly over a three year period.

      Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan

In
      February 1998, our Board of Directors adopted the 1998 Non-Employee Directors’
Stock Option Plan, or the Directors Plan, to provide for the automatic grant
      of
      non-qualified options to purchase shares of our common stock to our directors
      who are not employees or consultants of us or of an affiliate of us.

In
      July
      2000, the Board of Directors amended the 1998 Plan to incorporate the automatic
      grant provisions of the Directors’ Plan into the 1998 Plan. Future automatic
      grants to non-employee directors will be made according to the terms of the
      Directors’ Plan, but will be made out of the 1998 Plan until such time as shares
      may become available for issuance under the amended Directors’ Plan. In May
      2002, the Directors’ Plan was amended further to reduce the number of shares
      granted to our non-employee directors. The altered automatic grant provisions
      of
      the Directors’ Plan are also incorporated into the 1998 Plan. The terms of the
      amended Directors’ Plan are described below.


NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Under
      the
      amended Directors Plan, each non-employee director who is elected or appointed
      to our Board of Directors for the first time is automatically granted an option
      to purchase 75,000 shares, which vests quarterly over a three-year period,
      or
      Initial Grant. Previously, such a director was entitled to a grant of 200,000
      shares, vesting monthly over a four-year period.

Under
      the
      amended Directors Plan, on August 1, 2002, each non-employee director was
      automatically granted an option to purchase 75,000 shares, which will vest
      33%
      on the first anniversary of the grant date, with the remaining 66% vesting
      quarterly over the second and third years after the date of grant, provided
      that
      the director has attended at least 75% of the meetings during the year following
      the date of the grant, or 2002 Grants. Previously, such a director was entitled
      to an annual grant of 80,000 shares, vesting 100% on the first anniversary
      of
      the date of the grant.

On
      August
      1, 2003 and on each August 1 thereafter, each non-employee director will be
      automatically granted an option to purchase 25,000 shares, or Annual Grant.
      These Annual Grants will begin vesting on the second anniversary of the date
      of
      the grant and vest quarterly during the next year. The Annual Grants will be
      fully vested on the third anniversary of the date of the grant, provided that
      the director has attended at least 75% of the meetings during the year following
      the date of the grant.

On
      August
      1, 2002 and each August 1 of each year thereafter, each non-employee director
      who is a member of a committee of the Board of Directors will automatically
      be
      granted an option to purchase 5,000 shares, or Committee Grant. The Committee
      Grants vest in full on the first anniversary of the date of the grant, provided
      that the director has attended at least 75% of the meetings during the year
      following the date of the grant. Previously, such a director was entitled to
      a
      grant of 20,000 shares, vesting in full on the first anniversary of the date
      of
      the grant. Directors who were members of two committees, Messrs. Cox, Gaither
      and Jones, waived their grant of an additional 5,000 shares for being a member
      of a second committee in fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006.

If
      a
      non-employee director fails to attend at least 75% of the regularly scheduled
      meetings during the year following the grant of an option, rather than vesting
      as described previously, the 2002 Grants and Committee Grants will vest annually
      over four years following the date of grant at the rate of 10% per year for
      the
      first three years and 70% for the fourth year, and the Annual Grants will vest
      30% upon the three-year anniversary of the grant date and 70% for the fourth
      year, such that in each case the entire option will become fully vested on
      the
      four-year anniversary of the date of the grant. For the 2002 Grants, Annual
      Grants and Committee Grants, if the person has not been serving on the Board
      of
      Directors or committee since a prior year’s annual meeting, the number of shares
      granted will be reduced pro rata for each full quarter prior to the date of
      grant during which such person did not serve in such capacity.

The
      Compensation Committee administers the amended Directors Plan. A total of
      1,200,000 shares have been authorized and issued under the amended Directors
      Plan of which none is available for future issuance as of January 29, 2006.
      As
      described above, future grants to non-employee directors will be made out of
      the
      1998 Plan.

Employee
      Stock Purchase Plan

In
      February 1998, our Board of Directors approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase
      Plan, or the Purchase Plan. In June 1999, the Purchase Plan was amended to
      increase the number of shares reserved for issuance automatically each year
      at
      the end of our fiscal year for the next 10 years (commencing at the end of
      fiscal 2000 and ending 10 years later in 2009) by an amount equal to 2% of
      the
      outstanding shares on each such date, including on an as-if-converted basis
      preferred stock and convertible notes, and outstanding options and warrants,
      calculated using the treasury stock method; provided that the maximum number
      of
      shares of common stock available for issuance from the Purchase Plan could
      not

The
      Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under
      Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Purchase Plan, the Board
      has
      authorized participation by eligible employees, including officers, in periodic
      offerings following the adoption of the Purchase Plan. Under the Purchase Plan,
      separate offering periods shall be no longer than 27 months. Under the current
      offering adopted pursuant to the Purchase Plan, each offering period is 24
      months, which is divided into four purchase periods of 6 months.

Employees
      are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us
      as
      designated by the Board. Employees who participate in an offering may have
      up to
      10% of their earnings withheld pursuant to the Purchase Plan up to certain
      limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the
      purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage
      at
      its discretion, up to 15%. The price of common stock purchased under the
      Purchase Plan will be equal to the lower of the fair market value of the common
      stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the purchase date
      of
      each offering period at 85% at the fair market value of the common stock on
      the
      relevant purchase date. Employees may end their participation in the Purchase
      Plan at any time during the offering period, and participation ends
      automatically on termination of employment with us and in each case their
      contributions are refunded.

Inventory
      Purchase Obligations

At
      January 29, 2006, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling
      $401.6 million.

Convertible
      Subordinated Debentures

In
      October 2000, we sold $300.0 million 4¾% convertible subordinated debentures, or
      the Notes, due October 15, 2007 in a public offering. Proceeds from the offering
      were approximately $290.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts,
      commissions and offering expenses. Issuance costs related to the offering
      totaled $9.2 million and were amortized to interest expense over the term of
      the
      Notes. Interest on the Notes accrued at the rate of 4¾% per annum and was
      payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year,
      commencing April 15, 2001. Interest expense, excluding the amortization of
      issuance costs, related to the Notes for fiscal 2004 was $10.4 million. The
      Notes were redeemable at our option on or after October 20, 2003 and were also
      convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of
      business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into
      shares of common stock at a conversion price of $46.36 per share, subject to
      adjustment in certain circumstances.

On
      October 24, 2003, we fully redeemed the Notes. The aggregate principal amount
      of
      the Notes outstanding was $300.0 million, which included $18.6 million of Notes
      that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended October
      26, 2003. The redemption price was equal to approximately 102.7% of the
      outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest
      up
      to, but excluding, the redemption date. In

connection
      with the redemption of the Notes, we recorded a charge in our consolidated
      statement of income approximately $13.1 million, which included a $7.6 million
      redemption premium and $5.5 million for the write-off of unamortized issuance
      costs.

Lease
      Obligations

Our
      headquarters complex is located on a leased site in Santa Clara, California
      and
      is comprised of five buildings. The related leases expire in 2012 and each
      includes two seven-year renewals at our option. Future minimum lease payments
      under these operating leases total $152.8 million over the remaining terms
      of
      the leases, including predetermined rent escalations, and are included in the
      future minimum lease payment schedule below.

In
      addition to the commitment of our headquarters, we have other domestic and
      international office facilities under operating leases expiring through fiscal
      2013. Future minimum lease payments under our noncancelable operating leases
      as
      of January 29, 2006, are as follows:

      major classes:

Litigation

3dfx

On
      December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries
      entered into an agreement to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx.
      The 3dfx asset purchase closed on April 18, 2001.


NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

In
      May
      2002, we were served with a California state court complaint filed by the
      landlord of 3dfx’s San Jose, California commercial real estate lease. In
      December 2002, we were served with a California state court complaint filed
      by
      the landlord of 3dfx’s Austin, Texas commercial real estate lease. The
      landlords’ complaints both assert claims for, among other things, interference
      with contract, successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seek to recover,
      among other things, amounts owed on their leases with 3dfx in the aggregate
      amount of approximately $10 million. In October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter
      bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
      District of California. The landlords’ actions were subsequently removed to the
      United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California and
      consolidated with a complaint filed by the Trustee in the 3dfx bankruptcy case
      for purposes of discovery. Upon motion by NVIDIA in 2005, the District Court
      withdrew the reference to the Bankruptcy Court and the landlord actions were
      removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of
      California.  On November 10, 2005, the District Court granted NVIDIA's
      motion to dismiss the landlords’ respective amended complaints and allowed the
      landlords to have until February 4, 2006 to amend their complaints. The
      landlords’ refiled claims against NVIDIA in early February 2006, and NVIDIA
      again requested the District Court to dismiss all such claims made by the
      landlords. A hearing on NVIDIA’s new motions to dismiss is set for hearing on
      April 17, 2006. Discovery is stayed pending this hearing and no trial date
      has
      been set in these actions.  We believe the claims asserted against us by
      the landlords are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves
      vigorously.

In
      March
      2003, we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the
      Bankruptcy Court to represent the interests of the 3dfx bankruptcy estate.
      The
      Trustee’s complaint asserts claims for, among other things, successor liability
      and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us.  On October
      13, 2005, the Court held a hearing on the Trustee’s motion for summary
      adjudication. On December 23, 2005, the Court issued its ruling denying the
      Trustee's Motion for Summary Adjudication in all material respects and holding
      that NVIDIA is prevented from disputing that the value of the 3dfx
      transaction to NVIDIA was less than $108.0 million. The Court
      expressly denied the Trustee's request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets
      conveyed to NVIDIA were at least $108.0 million. In early November 2005, after
      many months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured
      Creditors, or the Creditors’ Committee, reached a conditional settlement of the
      Trustee’s claims against NVIDIA.  This conditional
      settlement, presented as the centerpiece of a proposed Plan of Liquidation
      in the bankruptcy case, is subject to a confirmation process
      through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy
      Court after notice and hearing.

The
      scope
      and schedule for that confirmation process has yet to be determined,
      but

we
      expect
      that hearing to now occur sometime in the next few months. The Trustee has
      advised that he intends to object to the settlement. The settlement with the
      Creditors’ Committee calls for a payment of approximately $30.6 million to the
      3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million relates to various
      administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million relates to the
      satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors
      of
      3dfx. As such, during the three month period ended October 30, 2005, we recorded
      $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional
      purchase price for 3dfx.

The
      Bankruptcy Court, over objection of the Creditors’ Committee and NVIDIA, has
      ordered the discovery portion of the litigation to proceed while the settlement
      is pending approval through the confirmation process. However, no trial date
      has
      been set in the Trustee's action. In addition, following the Trustee’s filing of
      a Form 8-K on behalf of 3dfx, in which the Trustee disclosed the terms of the
      proposed settlement agreement between NVIDIA and the Creditor’s Committee,
      certain shareholders of 3dfx filed a petition with the Bankruptcy Court to
      appoint an official committee to represent the claimed interest’s of 3dfx
      shareholders. That petition was granted and an Equity Holder’s Committee was
      appointed. Counsel for the Equity Holder’s Committee has announced an intention
      to file a competing Plan of Reorganization or Liquidation in the Trustee’s
      case.

Opti
      Incorporated

On
      October 19, 2004, Opti Incorporated, or Opti, filed a complaint for patent
      infringement against NVIDIA in the United States District Court for the Eastern
      District of Texas. Opti asserts that unspecified NVIDIA chipsets infringe five
      U.S. patents held by Opti. Opti seeks unspecified damages for our alleged
      conduct, attorneys’ fees and triple damages for alleged willful infringement by
      NVIDIA. NVIDIA filed a response to this complaint in December 2004. A case
      management conference was held in July 2005 where a trial date was set for
      July
      2006. A court

mandated
      mediation was held in January 2006 and did not resolve the matter. Discovery
      continues, as well as preparation for the Markman hearing on claim construction.
      The Markman hearing is scheduled for April 13, 2006. We believe the claims
      asserted against us are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves
      vigorously. We do not have sufficient information to determine whether a loss
      is
      probable. As such, we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated
      financial statements for such, if any, loss.

American
      Video Graphics

In
      August
      2004, a Texas limited partnership named American Video Graphics, LP, or AVG,
      filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various
      corporate defendants, not including NVIDIA, in the United States District Court
      for the Eastern District of Texas. AVG initially asserted that each of the
      approximately thirty defendants sells products that infringe one or more of
      seven separate patents that AVG claims relate generally to graphics processing
      functionality. In November 2004, NVIDIA sought and was granted permission to
      intervene in two of the three pending AVG lawsuits. Our complaint in
      intervention alleged that both of the patents in suit were invalid and that,
      to
      the extent AVG’s claims target NVIDIA products, the asserted patents were not
      infringed.

On
      December 19, 2005, AVG and substantially all of the named defendants and
      intervenors, including NVIDIA, settled all of pending claims; the only surviving
      claims will relate solely to two non-settling defendants. As part of the
      settlement, the defendants and intervenors paid an undisclosed aggregate amount
      to AVG. In exchange, all pending claims between the settling parties were
      dismissed with prejudice, and AVG granted to all settling parties a full release
      of all claims for past damages and a full license for all future sales of
      accused products under all of AVG’s patents, including the patents in suit. In
      addition, as part of the settlement, all settling defendants and intervenors
      fully and finally waived any claims for indemnification they may have had
      against any other settling party.

We
      are
      subject to other legal proceedings, but we do not believe that the ultimate
      outcome of any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on
      our
      financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, if
      an
      unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the
      possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that
      period.

Note
      12 - Settlement Costs

Settlement
      costs were $14.2 million for fiscal 2006.  The settlement costs are
      associated with two litigation matters, 3dfx and AVG.  AVG is settled. The
      3dfx matter is not finally settled and is subject to judicial review and the
      completion of appropriate procedures and documents. However, based on the
      potential settlement in this case, we have concluded that a loss is probable
      and
      that we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss.  Please refer to Note
      11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
      information.

      loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock
      options. The tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit
      carryforwards, if and when realized, would be accounted for as a credit to
      stockholders' equity. Of the remaining valuation allowance as of January 29,
      2006, $19.5 million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in
      certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets
      was determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to potential utilization
      limitations as a result of stock ownership changes, and $29.0 million relates
      to
      certain state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to
      be
      realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent
      realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes
      probable, recognition of these acquired tax benefits would first reduce goodwill
      to zero, then reduce other non-current intangible assets related to the
      acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income
      tax expense. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to
      certain state tax benefits becomes probable, we would recognize an income tax
      benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized.

As
      of
      January 29, 2006, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of
      approximately $374.1 million and cumulative state net operating loss
      carryforwards of approximately $180.1 million. The federal net operating loss
      carryforward will expire beginning in fiscal 2012 and the state net operating
      loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2007 according to the rules
      of
      each particular state. As of January 29, 2006, we had federal research and
      experimentation tax credit carryforwards of approximately $92.1 million that
      will begin to expire in fiscal 2008. The research and experimentation tax credit
      carryforward attributable to states is approximately $78.2 million, of which
      approximately $75.3 million is attributable to the State of California and
      may
      be carried over indefinitely, and approximately $2.9 million is attributable
      to
      various other states and will expire beginning in fiscal 2016 according to
      the
      rules of each particular state. We have other California state tax credit
      carryforwards of approximately $4.9 million that will begin to expire in fiscal
      2007. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may
      be
      subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided
      by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. If such a limitation
      applies, the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may expire before
      full utilization.

The
      American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or Act, was signed into law on October
      22,
      2004. The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States multinational
      corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the United States
      at a federal effective tax rate of 5.25%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006,
      we repatriated $420 million in foreign earnings under the Act. The net tax
      effect of this distribution was minimal because the current tax cost at a 5.25%
      tax rate was offset by the benefit attributable to reducing our deferred tax
      liability for taxes on earnings previously provided at the statutory rate of
      35%.

Note
      14 - Microsoft Agreement

On
      March
      5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft Corporation, or the
      Microsoft Agreement, in which we agreed, under certain terms and conditions,
      to
      develop and sell processors for use in the Xbox video game console. Under the
      Microsoft Agreement, in the event that an individual or corporation makes an
      offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares
      of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to
      purchase the stock.

Note
      15 - Segment Information

Our
        Chief
        Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker,
        or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment
        basis
        for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
        During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we reorganized our operating segments
        to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to position
        ourselves as the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor
        technologies. We now report financial information for four product-line
        operating segments to our CODM: the GPU Business is composed of products
        that
        support desktop PCs, notebook PCs and professional workstations; the MCP
        Business is composed of NVIDIA nForce products that operate as a single-chip
        or
        chipset that can off-load system functions, such as audio processing and
        network
        communications, and perform these operations independently from the host
        central
        processing unit, or CPU; our Handheld GPU Business is composed of products
        that
        support handheld personal digital assistants, cellular phones and other handheld
        devices; and our Consumer Electronics Business is concentrated in products
        that
        support video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices
        and
        is composed of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly
        develop a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s
        system solutions in SCE’s PlayStation3, revenue from sales of our Xbox-related
        products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft relating to the
        successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the Xbox360, and
        related
        devices, and digital media processor products. In addition to these operating
        segments, we have the “All Other” category that includes human resources, legal,
        finance, general administration and corporate marketing expenses, which total
        $121.2 million and $101.5 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively,
        that
        we do not allocate to our other operating segments. “All Other” also includes
        the results of operations of other miscellaneous operating segments that
        are
        neither individually reportable, nor aggregated with another operating segment.
        Revenue in the “All Other” category is primarily derived from sales of memory.
        All prior period amounts have been restated to reflect our new reporting
        structure.

Our
      CODM
      does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment
      basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly,
      there is none to be reported.  The accounting policies for segment
      reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.

For
      periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2005, product-line operating
      segment information other than revenue was impracticable to obtain primarily
      due
      to changes in our enterprise resource system structure that we implemented
      during the first quarter of fiscal 2005.

      17 - Subsequent Events

ULI
      Electronics, Inc.

On
      February 20, 2006, we completed the acquisition of ULi Electronics, Inc., a
      leading developer of core logic technology, for approximately $53 million paid
      in cash.

Stock
      Split.

On
      March 6, 2006, we issued a press release announcing that our
      Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of our outstanding shares
      of common stock to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The
      stock split will be effective on or about Thursday, April 6, 2006 for
      stockholders of record at the close of business on Friday, March 17, 2006 and
      will entitle each stockholder to receive one additional share for every
      outstanding share of common stock held. Upon the completion of the stock split,
      NVIDIA will have approximately 360 million shares of common stock outstanding.
      Had the stock split been given retroactive effect in our consolidated statements
      of income, the basic net income per share would have been $0.89, $0.30, and
      $0.23, and the diluted net income per share would have been $0.83, $0.28, and
      $0.22, for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, on an unaudited basis.

Stock
      Repurchase.

On
      March
      6, 2006, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase
      in our existing stock repurchase program. We announced a $400 million
      increase to the original stock repurchase program we had announced in August
      2004. As a result of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board of
      Directors has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total
      of
      $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market,
      in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase
      transactions, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule
      10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other
      factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount
      of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
