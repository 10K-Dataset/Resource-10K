Original
        equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs,
        add-in-card manufacturers, system builders and consumer electronics companies
        worldwide utilize NVIDIA processors as a core component of their entertainment
        and business solutions. Our GPUs are designed to deliver performance and
        visual
        quality for PC-based applications such as manufacturing, science, e-business,
        entertainment and education. Our MCPs perform demanding multimedia processing

Our
        Business

GPU
        Business

The
        combination of our GeForce 6, GeForce 7 and GeForce 8 series of GPUs and
        our
        Scalable Link Interface, or SLI, technology and NVIDIA Quadro professional
        solutions has created a new class of gaming PCs and professional
        workstations.  SLI technology takes advantage of the increased bandwidth of
        the peripheral component interconnect, or PCI, Express bus architecture to
        allow
        up to four NVIDIA GPUs to operate in a single PC or up to two NVIDIA GPUs
        to
        operate in a notebook PC or professional workstation. In fiscal 2007, we
        announced PureVideo High-Definition, or HD technology, a combination of hardware
        acceleration from an NVIDIA GPU, high definition movie player integration
        and
        High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection or HDCP, feature support, to enable
        manufacturers and consumers to build PCs that can play High-Definition Digital
        Video Disc, or HD DVD, or Blu-ray movies. In November 2006, we launched the
        GeForce 8800, the industry’s first GPU to support the new Microsoft DirectX 10
        Application Programming Interface, or API. DirectX 10 is a new API for the
        Microsoft Windows Vista

operating
        system

,
        or
        Vista, and includes many new features, such as a geometry shader. GeForce
        is the first DirectX 10 GPU based on Unified Shader architecture, which can
        adapt its computation resources to changing vertex and pixel shading workload
        from scene to scene. We also announced Compute Unified Device Architecture,
        or
        CUDA, a new mode of operation on GPUs where the computational power of the
        GPU
        can be utilized for computation-intensive applications.

Technology
        and market leadership in this generation of GPUs continues to be a key element
        of our corporate strategy. The combination of the programmable Unified Shader
        GPU with Microsoft Corporation’s, or Microsoft’s, DirectX 10 high-level shading
        language is known as DirectX 10 GPUs. Combined with the ability to directly
        access the GPU via the new Vista applications from Microsoft Office to Web
        2.0
        applications can now incorporate 3D effects. In fiscal 2007, our strategy
        was to
        extend our architectural and technology advantage with our second-generation
        GPUs to support DirectX 9.0 Shader Model 3.0, the GeForce 7 Series GPUs.
        By
        extending our leadership position in the performance segment with the production
        release of the GeForce 7900 in June 2006, we grew our market share from 79%
        to
        85%, according to the Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2005 and 2006 PC Graphics
        Reports, respectively.

The
        NVIDIA Quadro brand has become the benchmark of performance and compatibility
        for the professional industry. NVIDIA Quadro is recognized by many as the
        standard for professional graphics solutions needed to solve many of the
        world’s
        most complex visual computing challenges in the manufacturing, entertainment,
        medical, science, and aerospace industries. In fiscal 2007, we introduced
        NVIDIA
        Quadro Plex, a new category of visual computing solutions that brings a level
        of
        graphics scalability and processing density. In November 2006, we began seeding
        the industry with our GeForce 8 GPU, enabled with CUDA, a technology and
        compiler that, for the first time, allows for programmers to write C language
        applications for GPUs. GeForce 8 and CUDA will enable a new class of high
        performance computing we call “GPU Computing.” With CUDA-enabled GPUs, engineers
        and scientists will be able to harness programmable GPUs in PCs to solve
        mathematically-intensive problems that were previously cost prohibitive.

MCP
        Business

The
        NVIDIA nForce family of products represents our MCPs for Advanced Micro Devices,
        Inc., or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel,-based desktop, notebook,
        professional workstations and servers. Our strategy for MCPs aligns with
        what we
        anticipate will drive growth in the MCP segment such as multi-core,
        ever-increasing-speed networking and storage technologies, and integration
        of
        complex features such as virtualization, security processing, network processing
        and more. The In-Stat Trendy Chipset for the x86 Processor Report projects
        strong growth for PC chipsets through the end of this decade from $7.6 billion
        in calendar 2006 to over $10 billion in calendar 2009.

In
        fiscal
        2007, we began production shipments of our single-chip motherboard GPUs for
        AMD-based PCs. We are now the second largest core logic supplier in the world,
        according to the Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2006 PC Graphics Report.
        We are
        the largest supplier of AMD 64 chipsets with 53% segment share. NVIDIA nForce
        MCP unit shipments for AMD64-based CPUs increased over 113% calendar
        year-over-calendar year, based on the Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2006
        PC
        Processor Forecast Report.


Also
        during fiscal 2007, we launched our NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI MCP, which was
        designed for Intel Core 2 Quad and Core 2 Duo-based PCs. The NVIDIA nForce
        680i
        SLI MCP is a motherboard solution with dual Gigabit Ethernet ports and advanced
        storage features that is targeted at the hard-core enthusiast and provides
        support for some of the latest technologies, including NVIDIA SLI multi-GPU
        technology. We also started to design and released production of our own
        line of
        enthusiast-class NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI-based motherboards, which are being
        offered as a turnkey solution for select channel partners. Our "Designed
        by
        NVIDIA" program allows NVIDIA partners to bring NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI-based
        motherboards to market faster than before, and lets consumers know that the
        motherboard they are purchasing supports all of the hardware and software
        features that are offered with the NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI MCP.

In
        fiscal
        2007, we completed our acquisition of ULi Electronics, Inc., or ULi, a core
        logic developer for the PC industry. This acquisition represents our ongoing
        investment in our platform solution strategy.

Handheld
        GPU Business

Our
        strategy in our Handheld GPU business is to lead innovation and capitalize
        on
        the emergence of the cellular phone as a versatile consumer lifestyle
        device.  Every device in the NVIDIA GoForce product family is designed to
        provide a high-performance, visually rich multimedia experience on cellular
        phones and handheld devices. These products deliver an advanced visual
        experience by accelerating graphics and video applications. NVIDIA GoForce
        handheld GPUs and application processors implement design techniques, both
        inside the chips and at the system level, which result in high performance
        and
        long battery life. These technologies enhance visual display capabilities,
        improve connectivity, and minimize chip and system-level power consumption.
        NVIDIA GoForce products can be found in multimedia cellular phones, PDAs,
        and
        other handheld devices.

In
        March
        2006, NVIDIA and Intel announced a collaboration to bring a high-performance
        3D
        gaming and multimedia platform to handheld devices. In addition, in March
        we acquired Hybrid Graphics Ltd., or Hybrid Graphics, a developer of embedded
        2D
        and 3D graphics software for handheld devices. In June 2006, we launched
        our
        MobileMedia Platform development kit for handheld devices running Windows
        Mobile
        5.0.

In
        January 2007, we completed our acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc., or
        PortalPlayer, a leading supplier of semiconductors, firmware, and software

        and
        ultra-low power designs, enabling our customers to achieve superior performance
        in their products.

Increase
        Market Share

.    We
        believe that substantial market share will be important to achieving success.
        We
        intend to achieve a leading share of the market in areas in which we don't
        have
        a leading market share by devoting substantial resources to building families
        of
        products for a wide range of applications that offer significant improvement
        in
        performance over existing products.

Use

        Contracts.

In
        fiscal 2006, we entered into license arrangements that require significant
        customization of our intellectual property components and we anticipate that
        we
        will enter into additional agreements during fiscal 2008.  For license
        arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property
        components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the
        percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services
        are
        performed. For example, in April 2005, we finalized our definitive agreement
        with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCE’s PlayStation3.  Our
        collaboration with SCE includes license fees and royalties for the PlayStation3
        and all derivatives, including next-generation digital consumer electronics

Sales
        and Marketing

Our
        worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to
        become
        the leading supplier of performance GPUs, MCPs, and handheld GPUs for PCs,
        handheld devices and consumer electronics platforms. Our sales and marketing
        teams work closely with each industry’s respective OEMs, ODMs, system
        integrators, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and industry
        trendsetters, collectively our Channel, to define product features, performance,
        price and timing of new products. Members of our sales team have a high level
        of
        technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the
        competitive and complex design win process. We also employ a highly skilled
        team
        of application engineers to assist the Channel in designing, testing and
        qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that
        the
        depth and quality of our design support are key to improving the Channel’s
        time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within
        the
        Channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next
        generation of our products.

In
        the
        GPU and MCP segments we serve, the sales process involves achieving key design
        wins with leading OEMs and major system integrators and supporting the product
        design into high volume production with key ODMs, motherboard manufacturers
        and
        add-in board manufacturers. These design wins in turn influence the retail
        and
        system integrator channel that is serviced by add-in board and motherboard
        manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading
        independent contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, ODMs, motherboard
        manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and distributors each of which
        has
        relationships with a broad range of major OEMs and/or strong brand name
        recognition in the retail channel. In the handheld GPU segments we serve,
        the
        sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with
        the
        leading handheld OEMs and supporting the product design into high-volume
        production. Currently, we sell a significant portion of our digital media
        processors directly to distributors, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers
        and
        add-in board manufacturers, which then sell boards and systems with our products
        to leading OEMs, retail outlets and to a large number of system integrators.
        Although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue,
        their end customers include a large number of OEMs and system integrators
        throughout the world.


As
        a result of our
        channel strategy, our sales are focused on a small number of customers. Sales
        to
        Asustek Computer Inc., or Asustek, a CEM, accounted for 12% of our total
        revenue
        for fiscal 2007.

To
        encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized
        for platforms utilizing our products, we seek to establish and maintain strong
        relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing
        personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and
        discuss
        our products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical
        problems. Our developer program makes products available to developers prior
        to
        volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles
        that are optimized for our products.

Backlog

Our
        sales
        are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of
        products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject
        to
        revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in
        manufacturing availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by
        short
        lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice
        and
        experience, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is
        non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable
        portion is not significant. We do not believe that a backlog as of any
        particular date is indicative of future results.

Seasonality

Our
        industry is largely focused on the consumer products market. Due to the
        seasonality in this market, we typically expect to see stronger revenue
        performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the
        back-to-school and holiday seasons.

Manufacturing

We
        do not
        directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead
        we
        utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all product-line
        operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases
        of the
        manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and
        packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers
        that
        are certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO,
        in
        such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability
        and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the
        significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing
        operations. Our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of
        the
        raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can
        focus
        our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing
        and
        customer support.

We
        utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Chartered Semiconductor
        Manufacturing, or Chartered, Semiconductor Manufacturing International
        Corporation, or SMIC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or
        TSMC,
        United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, and American MicroSemiconductor,
        or
        AMS, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent
        subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, Amkor
        Technology, or Amkor, King Yuan Electronics Co., LTD, or KYEC, Siliconware
        Precision Industries Company Ltd., or SPIL, and STATS ChipPAC Incorporated,
        or
        ChipPAC, to perform assembly, testing and packaging of most of our
        products.

We
        typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform
        incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to CEMs,
        distributors, motherboard and add-in board manufacturer customers from our
        third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble
        and
        test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then
        ship
        the products to retailers, system integrators or OEMs as motherboard and
        add-in
        board solutions.

Inventory
        and Working Capital

Our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories
        and
        other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating
        with
        our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on
        a
        product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products
        that are based on this forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually
        purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to
        revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in
        manufacturing availability. We generally maintain substantial inventories
        of our
        products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead
        time
        orders and quick delivery schedules.


Research
        and Development

We
        believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed
        to
        deliver leading 3D graphics, HD video, audio, ultra-low power communications,
        storage, and secure networking performance and features is essential to our
        future success. Our research and development strategy is to focus on
        concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs, MCPs and Handheld GPUs
        application processors using independent design teams. Our research and
        development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of
        software engineering, hardware engineering, very large scale integration
        design
        engineering, process engineering, architecture and algorithms. These groups
        act
        as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of
        multiple generations of products.

A
        critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships
        with
        leaders in the CAD industry. We invest significant resources in the development
        of relationships with industry leaders, including Cadence Design Systems,
        Inc.,
        and Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these companies in the product definition
        of
        their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing
        next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products
        will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics market and develop
        products that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. We believe
        this
        approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC OEM and other
        manufacturers.

We
        substantially increased our engineering and technical resources in fiscal
        2007,
        and have 2,668 full-time employees engaged in research and development as
        of
        January 28, 2007, compared to 1,654 employees as of January 29, 2006. The
        majority of the research and development employees added during fiscal 2007
        are
        located in international locations, including India, China, Taiwan and various
        locations in Europe. During fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we incurred
        research and development expenditures of $553.5 million, $357.1 million and
        $348.2 million, respectively. Research and development expenses for fiscal
        included $70.1 million related to non-cash stock-based compensation, net
        of
        associated payroll taxes, which we began to record in fiscal 2007 as a result
        of
        our adoption of

Competition

The
        market for GPUs, MCPs and handheld GPUs application processors is intensely
        competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving
        industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe that
        the
        principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of
        product
        offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, backward-forward
        software support, conformity to industry standard APIs manufacturing
        capabilities, price of processors and total system costs of add-in boards
        or
        motherboards. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend
        on
        how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers
        will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our
        products at acceptable levels of quality. We expect competition to increase
        both
        from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may
        be less
        costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features
        not
        provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors
        or
        alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market
        share.

An
        additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide
        or
        intend to provide GPU, MCP, and Handheld GPU solutions. Some of our competitors
        may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources
        than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.
        Our current competitors include the following:

·

suppliers
                of discrete MCPs that incorporate a combination of networking, audio,
                communications and input/output, or I/O, functionality as part of
                their
                existing solutions, such as AMD, as a result of its acquisition of

ATI
                Technologies, Inc., or ATI

,
                Broadcom Corporation, or Broadcom, Silicon Integrated Systems,
                Inc., or SIS, and VIA Technologies, Inc., or VIA, and
                Intel;

·

suppliers
                of GPUs, including MCPs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality
                as part
                of their existing solutions, such as AMD, Intel, Matrox Electronics
                Systems Ltd., XGI Technology, Inc., SIS, and VIA;

·

suppliers
                of GPUs or GPU intellectual property for handheld and embedded devices
                that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their
                existing
                solutions, such as AMD, Broadcom, Fujitsu Limited, Imagination
                Technologies Ltd., ARM Holdings plc, Marvell Technology Group Ltd,
                or
                Marvell, NEC Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Technology,
                Seiko-Epson, Texas Instruments Incorporated, and Toshiba America,
                Inc.;
                and

·

suppliers
                of application processors for handheld and embedded devices that
                incorporate multimedia processing as part of their existing solutions
                such
                as Broadcom, Texas Instruments Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, Marvell,
                Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Samsung and ST
                Microelectronics.


We
        expect
        substantial competition from Intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling
        platform solutions dominated by Intel products, such as when Intel achieved
        success with its Centrino platform solution. In addition to its current Centrino
        notebook platform initiative, and its announced upcoming desktop initiative
        branded as VIIV, we expect that Intel is now focused on developing and selling
        platform solutions for all segments including professional workstations and
        servers. AMD has also begun to focus on selling platform solutions. If Intel
        and
        AMD continue to pursue these initiatives, we may not be able to successfully
        compete in these segments.

If
        and to
        the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise PC,
        notebook, workstation, PDA, cellular phone, and video game console markets,
        we
        may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from
        companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately predict
        if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. If we are
        unable to compete in our current and any new markets, our financial results
        will
        suffer.

Patents
        and Proprietary Rights

We
        rely
        primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee
        and
        third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect
        our
        intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our issued
        patents have expiration dates from September 4, 2007 to December 8, 2024.
        We
        have numerous patents issued and pending in the United States and in foreign
        countries. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to
        technology used by us in connection with our products. We also rely on
        international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our
        intellectual property. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal
        protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors
        as:
        the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in
        particular countries and regions; the location in which our products are
        manufactured; our strategic technology or product directions in different
        countries; and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are
        meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions.

Our
        pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved.
        In
        addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages
        or
        may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others
        may
        harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop
        substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to
        our
        trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect
        our
        intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology
        from
        third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive
        reasons, and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements. These
        licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing
        of
        technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements
        are
        not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer.

Employees

As
        of
        January 28, 2007 we had 4,083 employees, 2,668 of whom were engaged in research
        and development and 1,415 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations
        and administrative positions. None of our employees are covered by collective
        bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationships with our employees
        are
        good.

Financial
        Information by Business Segment and Geographic Data

Our
        Chief
        Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker,
        or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment
        basis
        for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
        During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we reorganized our operating segments
        to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to position
        ourselves as the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor
        technologies. We report financial information for four product-line operating
        segments to our CODM: the GPU Business is composed of products that support
        desktop PCs, notebook PCs, professional workstations and other GPU-based
        products; the MCP Business is composed of NVIDIA nForce products that operate
        as
        a single-chip or chipset that provide system functions, such as high speed
        storage and network communications, and perform these operations independently
        from the host CPU; our Handheld GPU Business is composed of products that
        support handheld PDAs, cellular phones and other handheld devices; and our
        Consumer Electronics Business is concentrated in products that support video
        game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices and is composed
        of
        revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom
        GPU for SCE’s PlayStation3, revenue from sales of our Xbox-related
        products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft relating to the
        successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the Xbox360, and
        related
        devices, and digital media processor products. In addition to these operating
        segments, we have the “All Other” category that includes human resources, legal,
        finance, general administration and corporate marketing expenses, which total
        $242.3 million, $131.6 million and $118.0 million for fiscal years 2007,
        and 2005, respectively, that we do not allocate to our other operating segments.
        “All Other” also includes the results of operations of other miscellaneous
        operating segments that are neither individually reportable, nor aggregated
        with
        another operating segment. Revenue in the “All Other” category is primarily
        derived from sales of memory.  Certain prior period amounts have been
        restated to conform to the presentation of our current fiscal
        quarter.


Our
        CODM
        does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment
        basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly,
        there is none to be reported.  The accounting policies for segment
        reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.  The information included
        in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is hereby
        incorporated by reference.

ITEM
        1A. RISK FACTORS

In
        evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered
        in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment
        involved some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below.
        Additionally, any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business,
        financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock
        price
        to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us
        or that
        we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
        operations.


Risks
        Related to Our Operations

The
        matters relating to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, or the
        Board,
        review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement
        of
        our consolidated financial statements have resulted in litigation, which
        could
        harm our financial results.

On
        August
        10, 2006, NVIDIA announced that the Audit Committee of the Board, with the
        assistance of outside legal counsel, was conducting a review of our stock
        option
        practices covering the time from NVIDIA’s initial public offering in 1999, our
        fiscal year 2000, through June 2006. The Audit Committee reached the conclusion
        that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes
        for
        stock option grants in certain prior periods. As a result, NVIDIA recorded
        additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and related tax effects,
        related to stock option grants.

The
        Audit
        Committee’s review of NVIDIA’s stock option practices identified a number of
        occasions on which the measurement date used for financial accounting and
        reporting purposes for stock options granted to certain of our employees
        was
        different from the actual grant date. To correct these accounting errors,
        we
        amended our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 29, 2006
        and
        our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended April 30, 2006,
        to
        restate the consolidated financial statements contained in those
        reports.

This
        review of our historical stock option granting practices required us to incur
        substantial expenses for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services,
        diverted our management’s attention from our business, and in the future could
        adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations
        and
        cash flows.

Our
        historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our prior
        financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation
        and regulatory proceedings. Ten derivative complaints have been filed in
        state
        and federal court pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants.
        We
        cannot assure you that these or future similar complaints, or any future
        litigation or regulatory action will result in the same conclusions reached
        by
        the Audit Committee. The conduct and resolution of these matters will be
        time
        consuming, expensive and could distract our management’s attention from the
        conduct of our business which could negatively impact our business.

We
        voluntarily contacted the SEC regarding the Audit Committee’s review and, as of
        the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, the SEC is continuing the inquiry
        of
        our historical stock option grant practices it began in late August 2006.
        In
        October 2006, we met with the SEC and provided it with a review of the status
        of
        the Audit Committee’s review and in November 2006 we voluntarily provided the
        SEC with further documents. We plan to continue to cooperate with the SEC
        in its
        inquiry.

While
        we
        believe that we have made appropriate judgments in concluding the correct
        measurement dates for option grants, the SEC may disagree with the manner
        in
        which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial
        impact
        of past option grant measurement date errors, and there is a risk that its
        inquiry could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate
        our
        prior financial statements, amend prior filings made with the SEC, or otherwise
        take other actions not currently contemplated. Any such circumstance could
        also
        lead to future delays in filing our SEC reports. Furthermore, if we are subject
        to adverse findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
        damages
        or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could harm our
        business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Because
        our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors, our failure
        to
        forecast any change in such factors could adversely affect our gross
        margin.

We
        continue to pursue improved gross margin. Our gross margin for any period
        depends on a number of factors, such as:

·

the
                mix of our products sold;

·

average
                selling prices;

·

introduction
                of new products;

·

sales
                discounts;

·

unexpected
                pricing actions by our competitors;

·

the
                cost of product components; and

·

the
                yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our
                products.

If
        we
        incorrectly forecast the impact of any of the aforementioned factors on our
        business, we may be unable to take action in time to counteract any negative
        impact on our gross margin. In addition, if we are unable to meet our gross
        margin target for any period or the target set by analysts, the trading price
        of
        our common stock may decline.


We
        are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could negatively
        impact our business.

Our
        performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive
        officers and key employees. None of our executive officers or employees is
        bound
        by an employment agreement, meaning our relationships with our executive
        officers and employees are at will. We do not have “key person” life insurance
        policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our
        executive officers, technical personnel or other key employees, particularly
        Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would harm our
        business. Our success will depend on our ability to identify, hire, train
        and
        retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Our failure to
        attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would
        harm
        our business. The integration of new executives or personnel could disrupt
        our
        ongoing operations.

Failure
        to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and/or new products
        could
        reduce our gross margin and could adversely affect our ability to compete
        effectively.

Semiconductor
        manufacturing yields are a function both of product design, which is developed
        largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to
        the
        manufacturer. Since low yields may result from either design or process
        technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined or
        resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to
        identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used.
        As a
        result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production
        process. Resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication
        between us and the manufacturer.

Because
        of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our
        manufacturers, any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase
        in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply
        among our customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships,
        our
        reputation, our revenue and our gross profit. Our wafer manufacturers may
        be
        unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future.
        Our
        inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could reduce
        our gross margin. We also face the risk of product recalls or product returns
        resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during
        the manufacturing and testing process. A significant number of product returns
        due to a defect or recall could damage our reputation, result in our customers
        working with our competitors, and could adversely impact our financial
        results.

To
        stay competitive we may have to invest more resources in research and
        development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses
        and
        negatively impact our operating results.

If
        new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other
        competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources
        than
        anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses
        would increase. We have increased our engineering and technical resources
        and
        had 2,668 full-time employees engaged in research and development as of January
        28, 2007, 1,654 full-time employees as of January 29, 2006 and 1,231 full-time
        employees as of January 30, 2005. Research and development expenditures were
        $553.5 million, $357.1 million and $348.2 million for fiscal 2007, 2006,
        and
        2005, respectively. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2007 included
        $70.1 million related to non-cash stock-based compensation, net of associated
        payroll taxes, which we began to record in the first quarter of fiscal 2007
        as a
        result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). If we are required to invest
        significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development
        efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
        In
        order to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote
        substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses
        to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased
        complexity and the greater number of products under development as well as
        hiring additional employees. Research and development expenses are likely
        to
        fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental
        investments in research and development and these investments may be independent
        of our level of revenue.

Our
        operating expenses are relatively fixed and we may not be able to reduce
        operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls.

Our
        operating expenses, which are comprised of research and development expenses
        and
        sales, general and administrative expenses, represented 27.6%, 24.1% and
        27.5%
        of our total revenue during fiscal years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively. Operating expenses for fiscal 2007 included $108.5 million
        related
        to non-cash stock-based compensation, net of associated payroll taxes, which
        we
        began to record in fiscal 2007 as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
        Since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last
        month
        of each quarter, we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a
        timely
        manner in response to any revenue shortfalls. If we are unable to reduce
        operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls, our financial
        results would be negatively impacted.


Failure
        to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could adversely affect
        our operating results and gross margin.

Our
        strategy is to utilize the most advanced manufacturing process technology
        appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-party
        foundries. Use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield
        problems and higher product cost. Manufacturing process technologies are
        subject
        to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and
        development. We continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller
        geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce
        costs.
        We currently use 0.15 micron, 0.14 micron, 0.13 micron, 0.11 micron, 90
        nanometer and 65 nanometer process technologies for our families of GPUs,
        MCPs,  Handheld GPUs and application processors.

We
        have
        experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the
        past
        and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries
        and increased expense levels. We may face similar difficulties, delays and
        expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry
        processes. Moreover, we are dependent on our relationships with our third-party
        manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully.
        Additionally, we compete with companies that own their own manufacturing
        facilities. These competitors may be able to move to a new state of the art
        manufacturing process more quickly than our manufacturing partners. If our
        suppliers fall behind our competitors in the manufacturing processes, the
        development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products
        could be negatively impacted. The inability by us or our third-party
        manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing
        process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross
        margin.

Our
        failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete
        inventory or, conversely, may result in inadequate inventory levels, either
        of
        which could adversely affect our financial results.

Our
        inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts or orders from
        our
        customers, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products
        that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing.
        In
        forecasting demand, we must make multiple assumptions any of which may prove
        to
        be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory,
        which
        could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory and/or a reduction
        in
        average selling prices, and where our gross margin could be adversely affected
        include:

·

if
                there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our
                products;

·

if
                there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of
                rapidly
                changing technology and customer
                requirements;

·

if
                we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older products
                as our
                newer products are introduced; or

·

if
                our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing
                actions.

Conversely,
        if we underestimate our customers’ demand for either our older or newer
        products, we may have inadequate manufacturing capability and may not be
        able to
        obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis.
        Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand,
        we
        may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner. Inability
        to fill
        our customers’ orders on a timely basis could damage our customer relationships,
        result in lost revenue, cause a loss in market share or damage our
        reputation.

Because
        we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand our ability
        to
        reduce our inventory purchase commitments quickly in response to any revenue
        shortfalls is limited.

Substantially
        all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term
        agreements. As a result, we may commit resources to the production of products
        without having received advance purchase commitments from customers. We may
        build inventories during periods of anticipated growth which does not occur.
        Any
        inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources
        could
        harm our business. In addition, cancellation or deferral of product orders
        could
        result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our
        gross
        margin and restrict our ability to fund operations. Additionally, because
        we
        often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each
        quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments
        in a
        timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls. We could be subject
        to
        excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory
        write-downs if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly
        forecast product demand, which could negatively impact our gross margin and
        financial results.


Our
        operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating
        results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the
        trading price of our stock could decline.

Many
        of
        our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict, and our operating
        expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period. It
        is,
        therefore, difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or
        losses. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results
        could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which
        could
        cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. We believe that our
        quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by
        a
        variety of factors that could harm our revenue, gross profit and results
        of
        operations.

Any
        one or more of the factors discussed in this Form 10-K or other factors could
        prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income.
        Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results
        of
        operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
        In
        addition, the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not
        necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter
        or a
        full fiscal year.

Risks
        Related to Our Products

If
        we are unable to achieve design wins, our products may not be adopted by
        our
        target markets or customers either of which could negatively impact our
        financial results.

The
        future success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability
        to
        develop new competitive products for our target markets and customers. We
        believe achieving design wins, which entails having our existing and future
        products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by PC OEMs,
        ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, will aid our future
        success. Our OEM, ODM, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ customers
        typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year,
        typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade
        shows. Accordingly, when our customers are making their design decisions,
        our
        existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely
        introduce new products in order to be included in new system configurations.
        This requires that we do the following:

·

anticipate
                the features and functionality that customers and consumers will
                demand;

·

incorporate
                those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting
                design requirements of OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard
                manufacturers;

·

price
                our products competitively; and

·

introduce
                products to the market within the limited design cycle for OEMs,
                ODMs, and
                add-in board and motherboard manufacturers.

If
        OEMs,
        ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products
        in their systems, they will typically not use our products in their design
        systems until at least the next design configuration. Therefore, we endeavor
        to
        develop close relationships with our OEMs and ODMs in an attempt to allow
        us to
        better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that our
        products will achieve design wins.

Our
        ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify
        and be compliant with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated changes
        in
        industry standards could render our products incompatible with products
        developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers, including
        AMD, Intel and Microsoft. Such changes would require us to invest significant
        time and resources to redesign our products to be compliant with relevant
        standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry
        standards for a significant period of time, our ability to achieve design
        wins
        could suffer. If we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or
        new
        customers, we may lose market share and our operating results would be
        negatively impacted.

Achievement
        of design wins may not result in the success of our products and could result
        in
        a loss of market share.

The
        process of being qualified for inclusion in an OEM or ODM product can be
        lengthy
        and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users for a particular
        product feature, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm
        our
        business. Even if we do have design wins for OEM and ODM products, we may
        not be
        able to successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes
        within the appropriate time to meet the OEM, ODM, add-in board and motherboard
        manufacturers’ design cycles as well as other market demand. Additionally, even
        if we achieve a significant number of design wins, there can be no assurance
        that our OEM and ODM customers will actually take the design to production
        or
        that the design will be commercially successful. Furthermore, there may be
        changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the
        introduction of our customers’ products that could negatively impact the success
        of our products. Any of these factors could result in a loss of market share
        and
        could negatively impact our financial results.


Our
        business results could be adversely affected if our product development efforts
        are unsuccessful.

We
        have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products.
        Any
        delay in the future or failure of our GPUs or other processors to meet or
        exceed
        specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business.
        The
        success of our new product introductions will depend on many factors, including
        the following:

·

proper new
                product definition;

·

timely
                completion and introduction of new product designs;

·

the
                ability of third-party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our
                new
                products in a timely manner;

·

dependence
                on third-party subcontractors for assembly, testing and packaging
                of our
                products and in meeting product delivery schedules and maintaining
                product
                quality;

·

the
                quality of new products;

·

differentiation
                of new products from those of our competitors;

·

market
                acceptance of our products and our customers' products; and

·

availability
                of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory
                products.

A
        critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships
        with
        leaders in the CAD industry. We have invested significant resources to develop
        relationships with industry leaders, including Cadence Design Systems, Inc.
        and
        Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these companies in the product definition
        of
        their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing
        next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products
        will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics, communications and
        networking segments and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology
        on
        a rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design
        schedules of PC OEMs and other manufacturers. If these relationships are
        not
        successful, we may not be able to develop new products in a timely manner,
        which
        could result in a loss of market share, a decrease in revenue and a negative
        impact on our operating results. Our failure to successfully develop, introduce
        or achieve market acceptance for new processors would harm our business.

Our
        failure to identify new market or product opportunities, or develop new products
        could harm our business.

As
        our
        GPUs or other processors develop and competition increases, we anticipate
        that
        product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling
        prices
        will decline. In particular, we expect average selling prices and gross margins
        for our processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume
        increases. As a result, we will need to introduce new products and enhancements
        to existing products to maintain or improve overall average selling prices
        and
        gross margins. In order for our processors to achieve high volumes, leading
        PC
        OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our
        processor for design into their products, and then successfully complete
        the
        designs of their products and sell them. We may be unable to successfully
        identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market new
        products in a timely fashion. In addition, we cannot guarantee that new products
        we develop will be selected for design into PC OEMs’, ODMs’, and add-in board
        and motherboard manufacturers’ products, that any new designs will be
        successfully completed, or that any new products will be sold.

As
        the
        complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for our products
        increases, there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with
        the
        performance of our products and that there will be delays in the development,
        introduction or volume shipment of our products. We may experience difficulties
        related to the production of current or future products or other factors
        that
        may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we develop. In
        addition, we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition
        risks with respect to future products. Failure to achieve any of the foregoing
        with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly
        declining average selling prices, reduced margins and reduced demand for
        products or loss of market share. In addition, technologies developed by
        others
        may render our processors non-competitive or obsolete or result in our holding
        excess inventory, any of which would harm our business.

We
        could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects.

Products
        as complex as those we offer may contain defects or experience failures when
        introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are
        released. We have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with
        customers’ hardware in some of our products and may experience delays or loss of
        revenue to correct any defects or incompatibilities in the future. Errors
        in new
        products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result
        in
        failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins. Our products
        typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume
        production and distribution. As a result, our products may contain defects
        or
        flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution. If
        these
        defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and
        distribution, we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair
        or
        replace the affected products in the field. We may also be required to incur
        additional research and development costs to find and correct the defect,
        which
        could divert the attention of our management and engineers from the development
        of new products. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect
        our
        business and operating results. We may also suffer a loss of reputation,
        loss of
        revenues and/or a loss in our market share, any of which could materially
        harm
        our financial results.


Risks
        Related to Our Partners and Customers

We
        may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits
        of
        business acquisitions, which could hurt our ability to grow our business,
        develop new products or sell our products.

In
        the
        past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products,
        services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our
        existing products and services or help expand our distribution channels.
        We may
        enter into future acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, in order
        to
        complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business
        market.
        For example, in February 2006 we completed the acquisition of ULi, in March
        we completed the acquisition of Hybrid Graphics and in January 2007 we completed
        the acquisition of PortalPlayer. If we do consider other acquisitions, a
        strategic alliance or a joint venture, the negotiations could divert
        management’s attention as well as other resources. For any previous or future
        acquisition or investment, including the acquisitions of ULi, Hybrid Graphics
        and PortalPlayer, the following risks could impair our ability to grow our
        business and develop new products, and ultimately, could impair our ability
        to
        sell our products, which could negatively impact our growth or our financial
        results:

·

difficulty
                in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of
                the
                acquired business with our business;

·

difficulty
                in operating in a new or multiple new locations;

·

disruption
                of our ongoing businesses;

·

disruption
                of the ongoing business of the company we
                acquire;

·

difficulty
                in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the
                transaction;

·

                in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and
                policies;

·

                of or delays in ongoing research and development
                efforts;

                arising from potential or actual business acquisitions or
                investments;

·

difficulties
                in entering into new markets in which we have limited or no experience
                and
                where competitors in such markets have stronger positions; and

·

impairment
                of relationships with employees and customers, or the loss of any
                of our
                key employees or of our target’s key employees, as a result of the
                integration of new businesses and management personnel.

In
        addition, the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash,
        shares of our common stock, the issuance of convertible debt securities or
        a
        combination of cash, convertible debt and common stock. If we pay all or
        a
        portion of the purchase price in cash, our cash reserves would be reduced.
        We
        paid for the acquisitions of Hybrid Graphics, ULi and PortalPlayer with
        primarily cash. If the consideration is paid with shares of our common stock,
        or
        convertible debentures, the holdings of our existing stockholders would be
        diluted. We cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future acquisitions,
        or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operations or
        financial results.

We
        depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products
        and
        these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements,
        which would harm our business.

We
        do not
        manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own
        or
        operate a wafer fabrication facility. Our products require wafers manufactured
        with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques so we utilize
        industry-leading suppliers to produce our semiconductor wafers. We depend
        on
        these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity
        sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and
        at
        acceptable manufacturing yields, and to deliver those products to us on a
        timely
        basis at acceptable prices. Currently, one foundry manufactures the majority
        of
        our products. These manufacturers may be unable to meet our near-term or
        long-term manufacturing or pricing requirements. We obtain manufacturing
        services on a purchase order basis. The foundries we use have no obligation
        to
        provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product. These suppliers,
        including the fabrication facility that produces a majority of our products,
        fabricate wafers for other companies, including some of our competitors,
        and
        could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, reduce or eliminate
        deliveries to us, or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice.
        If
        we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries,
        we could lose sales to customers, which would negatively impact our revenue
        and
        our reputation. Because the lead-time needed to establish a strategic
        relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters,
        there
        is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product.
        In addition, the time and effort to qualify a new foundry could result in
        additional expense, diversion of resources or lost sales any of which would
        negatively impact our financial results. We believe that long-term market
        acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with
        third-party manufacturers we may use to ensure adequate product supply and
        competitive pricing so that we are able to respond to customer
        demand.


We
        are dependent on third parties for assembly, testing and packaging of our
        products, which reduces our control over the delivery and quantity of our
        products.

Our
        processors are assembled, tested and packaged by independent subcontractors,
        such as ASE, Amkor, KYEC, SPIL, and ChipPAC. We do not have long-term agreements
        with any of these subcontractors. As a result of our dependence on third-party
        subcontractors for assembly, testing and packaging of our products, we do
        not
        directly control product delivery schedules or product quality. Demand for
        qualified independent subcontractors to assemble and test products is high.
        If demand for these subcontractors exceeds the number of qualified
        subcontractors, we may experience capacity constraints, which could result
        in
        product shortages, a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase
        in
        product cost. Any of our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders
        of
        one of our competitors over our orders. Any product shortages or quality
        assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing
        of our products, which could cause our gross margin to decline. Due to the
        amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers, we could
        experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required
        to find alternative third parties to assemble, test or package our products
        or
        components. Any such delays could result in a loss of reputation or a decrease
        in sales to our customers.

There
        can be no assurance that the PlayStation3 will achieve long term commercial
        success.

In
        April
        2005, we finalized our definitive agreement with SCE to jointly develop a
        custom
        GPU for SCE’s PlayStation3. Our collaboration with SCE includes license
        fees and royalties for the PlayStation3 and all derivatives, including
        next-generation digital consumer electronics devices.  In addition, we are
        licensing software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics
        capabilities to SCE. During fiscal 2007, we recognized $92.9 million of
        revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE. There can be no
        assurance that the PlayStation3 will achieve long term commercial success,
        given
        the intense competition in the game console market.  If we do not receive
        royalties as we anticipate, our revenue and gross margin may be adversely
        affected.

As
        we continue to work directly with more foreign customers, any difficulties
        in
        collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial
        condition.

Our
        accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse
        changes in our customers' businesses and to downturns in the economy and
        the
        industry. In addition, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or
        the
        loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our
        financial condition and results of operations. We continue to work directly
        with
        more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable
        from them. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
        resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
        This
        allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an
        amount
        based on overall estimated exposure. If the financial condition of our customers
        were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
        payments, additional allowances may be required, we may be required to defer
        revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required
        to pay
        higher credit insurance premiums, which could adversely affect our operating
        results. We may have to record additional reserves or write-offs and/or defer
        revenue on certain sales transactions in the future, which could negatively
        impact our financial results.

We
        rely on third-party vendors to supply software development tools to us for
        the
        development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools
        necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products.

When
        we
        design and develop new products or product enhancements, we rely on third-party
        software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and
        verification of new products or enhancements to existing products. Although
        we
        currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools,
        some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future.
        Additionally, the software development tools available at the time that we
        are
        designing, simulating or verifying a product may not be sophisticated enough
        or
        technologically advanced enough for our purposes. For example, we have
        experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result
        of
        the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate
        the
        complex features and functionalities of our products. Therefore, the design
        requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater
        functionality from our processors in the future may exceed the capabilities
        of
        the software development tools that are available to us. If the software
        development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that
        meet
        consumer demands, we may miss design cycles or lose design wins either of
        which
        could result in a loss of market share, a decrease in revenue or negatively
        impact our operating results.


We
        sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer
        by the loss of any of these customers.

We
        have
        only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated.
        Sales
        to one significant customer accounted for approximately 12% of our total
        revenue during fiscal 2007. Sales to two significant customers during fiscal
        2006 accounted for approximately 26% of our total revenue. In addition, one
        customer has historically comprised a significant portion of our Handheld
        GPU
        business revenue. Although a small number of our other customers represents
        the
        majority of our revenue, their end customers include a large number of OEMs
        and
        system integrators throughout the world who, in many cases, specify the graphics
        supplier. Our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading
        PC
        OEMs and major system builders and supporting the product design into high
        volume production with key CEMs, ODMs, add-in board and motherboard
        manufacturers. These design wins in turn influence the retail and system
        builder
        channel that is serviced by CEMs, ODMs, add-in board and motherboard
        manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of
        leading independent CEMs, ODMs, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers,
        and
        distributors, each of which has relationships with a broad range of system
        builders and leading PC OEMs. If we were to lose sales to our PC OEMs, CEMs,
        ODMs, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and were unable to replace
        the
        lost sales with sales to different customers, or if they were to significantly
        reduce the number of products they order from us, our revenue may not reach
        or
        exceed the expected level in any period, which could harm our financial
        condition and our results of operations.

Risks
        Related to Our Competition

As
        Intel and AMD continue to pursue platform solutions, we may not be able to
        successfully compete and our business would be negatively
        impacted.

We
        expect
        substantial competition from both Intel’s and AMD’s strategy of selling platform
        solutions, such as the success Intel achieved with its Centrino platform
        solution. In addition to the Centrino notebook platform solution, Intel has
        announced a desktop initiative branded as VIIV. Shortly after its acquisition
        of
        ATI, AMD also announced a platform solution. Such platform solutions do not
        require a discrete GPU from a third-party supplier such as NVIDIA. Prior
        to its
        acquisition of ATI, AMD did not sell their own GPUs but instead relied on
        companies such as ATI or NVIDIA to supply graphics technology. If AMD and
        Intel
        continue to pursue platform solutions in desktop and notebook PCs, we may
        be
        unable to sell GPUs to either company. Additionally, we expect that Intel
        and
        AMD will extend this strategy to other segments including professional
        workstations and servers. To the extent Intel and AMD are successful with
        the
        platform strategy, they would no longer need our discrete GPU solutions which
        would negatively impact our business.

The
        market for GPU, MCP, Handheld GPUs and application processors is highly
        competitive and we may be unable to compete.

The
        market for GPUs, MCPs and Handheld GPUs is intensely competitive and is
        characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards
        and
        declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive
        factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access
        to
        customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support,
        conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces,
        manufacturing capabilities, price of processors and total system costs of
        add-in
        boards and motherboards. We believe that our ability to remain competitive
        will
        depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that
        customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes
        of
        our products at acceptable levels of quality. We expect competition to increase
        both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that
        may be
        less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features
        not provided by our products, which could harm our business.

For
        example, we are the largest supplier of AMD 64 chipsets with 53% segment
        share.
        NVIDIA nForce MCP unit shipments for AMD64-based CPUs increased over 113%
        calendar year-over-calendar year, based on the Mercury Research Fourth Quarter
        2006 PC Processor Forecast Report. Decline in demand in the AMD segment would
        harm our business.

An
        additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide
        or
        intend to provide GPU, MCP, and Handheld GPU solutions. Some of our competitors
        may have or be able to obtain greater marketing, financial, distribution
        and
        manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer
        or
        technological changes. Our current competitors include the following:

·

suppliers
                of discrete MCPs that incorporate a combination of networking, audio,
                communications and input/output, or I/O, functionality as part of
                their
                existing solutions, such as AMD, Broadcom, SIS, VIA, and
                Intel;

·

suppliers
                of GPUs, including MCPs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality
                as part
                of their existing solutions, such as AMD, Intel, Matrox Electronics
                Systems Ltd., XGI Technology, Inc.,
                SIS and VIA;


·

suppliers
                of GPUs or GPU intellectual property for handheld and embedded devices
                that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their
                existing
                solutions, such as AMD, Broadcom, Fujitsu Limited, Imagination
                Technologies Ltd., ARM Holdings plc, Marvell, NEC Corporation, Qualcomm
                Incorporated, Renesas Technology, Seiko-Epson, Texas Instruments
                Incorporated, and Toshiba America, Inc.;
                and

·

suppliers
                of application processors for handheld and embedded devices that
                incorporate multimedia processing as part of their existing solutions
                such
                as Broadcom, Texas Instruments Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, Marvell,
                Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Samsung and ST
                Microelectronics.

If
        and to
        the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise PC,
        notebook, workstation, PDA, cellular phone, and video game console markets,
        we
        may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from
        companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately predict
        if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. If we are
        unable to compete in our current or new markets, our financial results will
        suffer.

Risks
        Related to Market Conditions

We
        are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm
        our
        business.

Our
        semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by
        third-parties located outside of the United States. Additionally, we generated
        83.6% of our revenue for fiscal 2007 and 84.0% of our revenue for fiscal
        from sales to customers outside the United States and other Americas. The
        manufacture, assembly, test and packaging of our products outside of the
        United
        States, operation of offices outside of the United States, and sales to
        customers outside of the United States and other Americas subjects us to
        a
        number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the United
        States
        and other Americas, including, but not limited to:

·

international
                economic and political conditions;

·

unexpected
                changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;

·

labor
                issues in foreign countries;

·

cultural
                differences in the conduct of
                business;

·

inadequate
                local infrastructure;

·

delays
                resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain
                technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and
                restrictions;

·

transportation
                delays;

·

longer
                payment cycles;

·

difficulty
                in collecting accounts receivable;

·

fluctuations
                in currency exchange rates;

·

impact
                of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the price of our products
                to our
                customers, or on the supplies that we
                buy;

·

imposition
                of additional taxes and penalties;

·

different
                legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property;

·

the
                burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and

·

other
                factors beyond our control, including terrorism, civil unrest, war
                and
                diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Avian
                flu.

If
        sales
        to any of our customers outside of the United States and other Americas are
        delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may
        be
        negatively impacted.

We
        have
        offices outside of the United States, including offices in Taiwan, Japan,
        Korea,
        China, Hong Kong, India, France, Russia, Germany, Finland and England. During
        fiscal 2007, we added 934 international employees to our international
        operations. As a result of our acquisition of PortalPlayer, we acquired land
        and
        a building under construction in Hyderabad, India. Our operations in our
        international locations are subject to many of the risks contained in the
        above
        list. We intend to continue to expand our operations and expect to open other
        international offices. Difficulties with our international operations, including
        finding appropriate staffing and office space, may divert management’s attention
        and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating
        results.


We
        are dependent on the PC market and the rate of its growth has and may in
        the
        future have a negative impact on our business.

We
        derive
        the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop
        PC
        and notebook PC markets, including professional workstations. We expect to
        continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products
        for
        use in the desktop PC and notebook PC markets in the next several years.
        A
        reduction in sales of PCs, or a reduction in the growth rate of PC sales,
        will
        reduce demand for our products. Moreover, changes in demand could be large
        and
        sudden. Since PC manufacturers often build inventories during periods of
        anticipated growth, they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows
        or
        if they incorrectly forecast product transitions. In these cases, PC
        manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional
        inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed,
        which would have a negative impact on our business.

If
        our products do not continue to be adopted by the consumer and enterprise
        desktop PC, notebook PC, workstation, PDA, cellular phone, and video game
        console markets or if the demand in these markets for new and innovative
        products decreases, our business and operating results would suffer.

Our
        success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our processors for
        3D
        graphics and multimedia in consumer and enterprise PC, notebook PC, workstation,
        PDA, cellular phone, and video game console applications. The market for
        processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts
        in
        the popularity of products, often caused by the publication of competitive
        industry benchmark results, changes in pricing of dynamic random-access memory
        devices and other changes in the total system cost of add-in boards, as well
        as
        by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product
        introductions. Broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market
        acceptance, if achieved, is difficult to sustain due to intense competition
        and
        frequent new technology and product introductions. Our GPU and MCP businesses
        comprised over 86.5% of fiscal 2007 revenue. As such, our financial results
        would suffer if for any reason our current or future GPUs or MCPs do not
        continue to achieve widespread adoption by the PC market. If we are unable
        to
        complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully
        and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements
        of the consumer and enterprise PC, notebook, workstation, PDA, cellular phone,
        and video game console markets, we may experience a decrease in revenue which
        could negatively impact our operating results. Additionally, there can be
        no
        assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved
        standards, features or performance. If our customers, OEMs, ODMs, add-in-card
        and motherboard manufacturers, system builders and consumer electronics
        companies, do not continue to design products that require more advanced
        or
        efficient processors and/or the market does not continue to demand new products
        with increased performance, features, functionality or standards, sales of
        our
        products could decline.

Our
        failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result
        in
        a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of production, excess
        inventory, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities.

We
        may be
        subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations
        governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain
        substances in electronic products and making producers of those products
        financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal
        of
        those products. The European Union Directive on Restriction of Hazardous
        Substances Directive, or RoHS Directive, is European legislation that restricts
        the use of a number of substances, including lead, and other hazardous
        substances in electrical and electronic equipment in the market in the European
        Union which became effective on July 1, 2006. Similarly, the State of California
        has adopted certain restrictions, which go into effect in 2007, that restrict
        the use of certain materials in electronic products, which are intended to
        harmonize with the RoHS directive and other states are contemplating similar
        legislation. China has adopted similar legislation to the RoHS directive
        which
        began to go into effect on March 1, 2007.

Also,
        we
        could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with the European
        Union Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, or WEEE. The
        WEEE
        directs members of the European Union to enact laws, regulations, and
        administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic
        equipment are financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment
        and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the
        market after August 15, 2005. Implementation in certain European Union member
        states has been delayed into 2007. Similar legislation has been or may be
        enacted in other jurisdictions, including the United States, Canada, Mexico,
        China and Japan, the cumulative impact of which could be significant. We
        continue to evaluate the impact of specific registration and compliance
        activities required by WEEE.

It
        is
        possible that unanticipated supply shortages, delays or excess non-compliant
        inventory may occur as a result of such regulations. Failure to comply with
        any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences
        including costs, fines, suspension of production, excess inventory, sales
        limitations, criminal and civil liabilities and could impact our ability
        to
        conduct business in the countries that have adopted these types of
        regulations.


We
        are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments
        and in interest rates.

At
        the
        end of fiscal 2007, we had $1.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and
        marketable securities. We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments,
        consisting principally of investments in commercial paper, money market funds
        and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the
        United
        States government and its agencies. These investments are denominated in
        U.S.
        dollars.

We
        account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
        Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. All of the cash equivalents and
        marketable securities are treated as “available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115.
        Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments
        carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have
        their
        market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating
        rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall.
        Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short
        of
        expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value
        of
        our publicly traded equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary.
        We
        may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline
        in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any debt
        securities we hold are classified as “available-for-sale,” no gains or losses
        are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are
        sold
        prior to maturity.

Our
        business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our financial
        results.

Our
        business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical
        semiconductor industry, including alternating periods of overcapacity and
        capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing costs and yields, significant
        expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid
        technological change. If we are unable to respond to changes in our industry,
        which can be unpredictable and rapid, in an efficient and timely manner,
        our
        operating results could suffer. In particular, from time to time, the
        semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged
        downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion
        of
        average selling prices. If we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing
        our manufacturing or operating costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand
        during a downturn, our revenue and earnings will suffer.

Political
        instability in Taiwan and in The People’s Republic of China or elsewhere could
        harm our business.

Because
        of our reliance on foundries and independent contractors located in Taiwan
        and
        The People’s Republic of China, and because we have offices in these locations,
        our business may be harmed by political instability in Taiwan, including
        the
        worsening of the strained relations between The People’s Republic of China and
        Taiwan.

Risks
        Related to Government Action, Regulatory Action, Intellectual Property, and
        Litigation

The
        pending investigation by the United States Department of Justice regarding
        investigation into the market for Graphics Processors could adversely affect
        our
        business.

On
        November 29, 2006, we received a subpoena from the San Francisco Office of
        the
        Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, in
        connection with the DOJ's investigation into potential antitrust violations
        related to graphics processing units and cards. No specific allegations have
        been made against us. We plan to cooperate with the DOJ in its investigation.
        As
        of March 14, 2007, 42 civil complaints have been filed against us. The
        majority are pending in the Northern District of California, a number are
        pending in the Central District of California, and other cases are pending
        in
        several other Federal district courts. Although the complaints differ, they
        generally purport to assert federal and state antitrust claims based on alleged
        price fixing, market allocation, and other alleged anti-competitive agreements
        between us and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, as a result of its
        acquisition of ATI Technologies, Inc., or ATI. Many of the cases also assert
        a
        variety of state law unfair competition or consumer protection claims on
        the
        same allegations and some cases assert unjust enrichment or other common
        law
        claims. The complaints are putative class actions alleging classes of direct
        and/or indirect purchasers of our graphic processing units and cards. The
        plaintiffs in a few of the Northern District of California actions have filed
        a
        motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation asking that all
        pending and subsequent cases be consolidated in one court for all pre-trial
        discovery and motion practice. A hearing on this motion is set for March
        29,
        2007. We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and
        intend
        to vigorously defend the cases.


Expensing
        employee stock options materially and aversely affects our reported operating
        results and could also adversely affect our competitive
        position.

Since
        inception, we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program
        as
        fundamental components of our compensation packages. We believe that these
        incentives directly motivate our employees and, through the use of vesting,
        encourage our employees to remain with us. As a result of adjustments arising
        from our restatement related to stock option grant dates, our operating results
        for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2007 contain recorded amounts of stock-based
        compensation expense. For our fiscal 2000 through 2006, this stock-based
        compensation expense was calculated using primarily the intrinsic value-based
        method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, or APB 25,

Accounting
        for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations.

In
        December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
        issued SFAS No. 123(R)

which
        requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
        stock-based compensation payments.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires that we record
        compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan
        using the fair value of those awards. During fiscal 2007, we recorded $116.7
        million, related to stock-based compensation, net of the associated payroll
        tax
        impact resulting from our restatement, which negatively impacted our operating
        results. We believe that SFAS No. 123(R) will continue to negatively impact
        our
        operating results.

To
        the
        extent that SFAS No. 123(R) makes it more expensive to grant stock options
        or to
        continue to have an employee stock purchase program, we may decide to incur
        increased cash compensation costs. In addition, actions that we may take
        to
        reduce stock-based compensation expense that may be more severe than any
        actions
        our competitors may implement may make it difficult to attract, retain and
        motivate employees, which could adversely affect our competitive position
        as
        well as our business and operating results.

We
        are a party to litigation, which, if determined adversely to us, could harm
        our
        business and financial condition.

We
        are a
        party to litigation. There can be no assurance that actions that have been
        brought against us or any brought by us will be resolved in our favor. Any
        claim
        that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial
        damages
        and other related fees. Regardless of whether these lawsuits are resolved
        in our
        favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation, any
        lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming
        to
        defend or resolve. Such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing
        customers and result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away
        from business operations, which could harm our business. Costs of defense
        and
        any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement
        of the
        litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.

Our
        ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect
        our
        intellectual property.

We
        rely
        primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee
        and
        third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect
        our
        intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We have numerous
        patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and in foreign
        countries. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to
        technology used by us in connection with our products. We also rely on
        international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our
        intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our
        products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries
        in
        Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the
        same
        extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy
        of
        our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and
        where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies
        based on such factors as:

·

the
                commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations
                in particular countries and
                regions;

·

the
                location in which our products are manufactured;

·

our
                strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
                and

·

the
                degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully
                enforced in different
                jurisdictions.

Our
        pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved.
        In
        addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages
        or
        may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others
        may
        harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop
        substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to
        our
        trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect
        our
        intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology
        from
        third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors and for
        defensive reasons, and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.
        These licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross
        licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these
        arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business
        could suffer.


Litigation
        to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or
        to
        enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation
        could result in substantial costs to us.

We
        expect
        that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and
        as
        competition intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement
        claims
        and lawsuits may increase. We may become involved in lawsuits or other legal
        proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights
        violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them
        for
        certain claims of infringement arising out of the sale of our products to
        these
        customers. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation
        of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of
        lost
        profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief.

In
        addition, we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in
        order
        to:

·

assert
                claims of infringement of our intellectual
                property;

·

enforce
                our patents;

·

protect
                our trade secrets or know-how; or

·

determine
                the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of
                others.

If
        we
        have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property,
        our
        operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating
        results. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could
        harm
        our business.

If
        infringement claims are made against us or we are found to infringe a third
        parties’ patent, we may seek licenses under the third parties’ patents or other
        intellectual property rights. In addition, an indemnified customer may be
        required to obtain a license to a third parties’ patents or intellectual
        property. However, licenses may not be offered to us at all or on terms
        acceptable to us, particularly by competitors. If we fail to obtain a license
        from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our
        products used by an indemnified customer, we could be subject to substantial
        liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of
        one or
        more of our products either of which could reduce our revenue and harm our
        business. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer may increase our
        operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.

Our
        operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected
        tax
        liabilities.

We
        are
        subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United
        States
        and throughout the world. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which
        we
        operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for
        our
        income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate
        tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are
        reasonable, any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially
        different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions
        and
        accruals:

·

the
                jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;

·

adjustments
                to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;

·

changes
                in available tax credits;

·

changes
                in share-based compensation expense;

·

changes
                in tax laws, the interpretation of tax laws either in the United
                States or
                abroad or the issuance of new interpretative accounting guidance
                related
                to uncertain transactions and calculations where the tax treatment
                was
                previously uncertain; and

·

the
                resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax
                authorities.

Should
        additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above, our operating
        results could be adversely affected. In addition, our future effective tax
        rate
        could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries
        with
        differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or changes in the
        interpretation of tax laws.


While
        we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial
        reporting, we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to
        evaluate those internal controls.

Section 404
        of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and
        our
        independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness
        of
        our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. We
        have
        an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing
        necessary to comply with these requirements. However, the manner in which
        companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements
        and testing companies’ internal controls, remains subject to some uncertainty.
        To date, we have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur increased expense
        and to devote additional management resources to Section 404 compliance.
        Despite our efforts, if we identify a material weakness in internal controls,
        there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate such material
        weakness identified in a timely manner, or that we will be able to maintain
        all
        of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial
        reporting is effective. In the event that our chief executive officer, chief
        financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine
        that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined
        under Section 404, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and
        could cause a decline in the market price of our stock.

Changes
        in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could
        affect our reported results of operations

.

We
        prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States
        generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are constantly
        subject to review and interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed
        to
        interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these
        principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may
        even
        retroactively affect previously reported transactions.

Risks
        Related to our Common Stock

Provisions
        in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft
        could delay or prevent a change in control.

Our
        certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make
        it
        more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding
        voting
        stock. These provisions include the following:

·

the
                ability of the Board to create and issue preferred stock without
                prior
                stockholder approval;

·

the
                prohibition of stockholder action by written consent;

·

a
                classified Board; and

·

advance
                notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals.

On
        March
        5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to
        develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft
        and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual
        or
        corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30%
        of
        the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and
        last
        rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the
        other
        factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA.

          headquarters complex is located on a leased site in Santa Clara, California
          and
          is comprised of six buildings. Additionally, we lease three other buildings
          in
          Santa Clara with one used as warehouse space and the other two used as
          lab
          space. Outside of Santa Clara, we lease space in Austin and Houston, Texas;
          Berkeley, California; Beaverton, Oregon; Bedford, Massachusetts; Bellevue
          and
          Kirkland, Washington; Madison, Alabama; Charlotte and Durham, North Carolina;
          Greenville, South Carolina; and Fort Collins, Colorado. These facilities
          are
          used as design centers and/or sales and administrative offices.

Outside
          of the United States, we lease space in Taipei and Neihu in Taiwan; Tokyo,
          Japan; Seoul, Korea; Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, China; Wanchai, and
          Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong; Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune, India;
          Paris,
          France; Moscow, Russia; Munich and Wurselen, Germany; Helsinki, Finland
          and
          Theale, England. These facilities are used primarily to support our customers
          and operations and as sales and administrative offices. The office lease
          spaces
          in Wurselen, Germany, Shenzhen, China and Bangalore, Pune and Hyderabad,
          India
          are used primarily as design centers. Additionally, as a result of our
          acquisition of PortalPlayer, we acquired a building under construction
          in
          Hyderabad, India, which will be used primarily as a design center.

We
        believe that we currently have sufficient facilities to conduct our operations
        for the next twelve months, although we expect to lease additional facilities
        throughout the world as our business requires. For additional information
        regarding obligations under leases, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated
        Financial Statements under the subheading “Lease Obligations,” which information

ITEM
        3. LEGAL
        PROCEEDINGS

3dfx

On
        December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries
        entered into an agreement to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx
        Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, which closed on April 18, 2001.

In
        May
        2002, we were served with a California state court complaint filed by the
        landlord of 3dfx’s San Jose, California commercial real estate lease,
        CarrAmerica. In December 2002, we were served with a California state court
        complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s Austin, Texas commercial real estate
        lease, Carlyle Fortran Trust. The landlords’ complaints both asserted claims
        for, among other things, interference with contract, successor liability
        and
        fraudulent transfer and seek to recover, among other things, amounts owed
        on
        their leases with 3dfx in the aggregate amount of approximately $15 million.
        In
        October 2002, 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United
        States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. The landlords’
actions were subsequently removed to the United States Bankruptcy Court for
        the
        Northern District of California and consolidated, for purposes of discovery,
        with a complaint filed by the Trustee in the 3dfx bankruptcy case. Upon motion
        by NVIDIA in 2005, the District Court withdrew the reference to the Bankruptcy
        Court and the landlord actions were removed to the United States District
        Court
        for the Northern District of California. On November 10, 2005, the District
        Court granted our motion to dismiss the landlords’ respective amended complaints
        and allowed the landlords to have until February 4, 2006 to amend their
        complaints. The landlords re-filed claims against NVIDIA in early February
        2006,
        and NVIDIA again filed motions requesting the District Court to dismiss all
        such
        claims. The District Court took both motions under submission. On September
        29,
        2006, the court dismissed the CarrAmerica action in its entirety and without
        leave to amend. The court found, among other things, that CarrAmerica lacks
        standing to bring the lawsuit and that such standing belongs exclusively
        to the
        bankruptcy trustee. On October 27, 2006, CarrAmerica filed a notice of appeal
        from that order. On December 15, 2006, the District Court also dismissed
        the
        Carlyle complaint in its entirety, finding that Carlyle lacked standing to
        pursue some of its claims, and that certain other claims were substantively
        unmeritorious. NVIDIA has filed motions to recover its litigation costs and
        attorneys fees against both Carlyle and Carr. Those motions are currently
        scheduled for hearing in early April, 2007.

In
        March
        2003, we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the
        Bankruptcy Court to represent the interests of the 3dfx bankruptcy estate.
        The
        Trustee’s complaint asserts claims for, among other things, successor liability
        and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us. On October
        13,
        2005, the Court held a hearing on the Trustee’s motion for summary adjudication.
        On December 23, 2005, the Court issued its ruling denying the Trustee’s Motion
        for Summary Adjudication in all material respects and holding that NVIDIA
        is
        prevented from disputing that the value of the 3dfx transaction to NVIDIA
        was
        less than $108.0 million. The Court expressly denied the Trustee’s request to
        find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to NVIDIA were at least $108.0
        million. In early November 2005, after many months of mediation, NVIDIA and
        the
        Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, or the Creditors’ Committee, reached
        a conditional settlement of the Trustee’s claims against NVIDIA. This
        conditional settlement, presented as the centerpiece of a proposed Plan of
        Liquidation in the bankruptcy case, was subject to a confirmation process
        through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy
        Court
        after notice and hearing. The Trustee advised that he intended to object
        to the
        settlement, which would have called for a payment by NVIDIA of approximately
        $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million related
        to
        various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million related
        to
        the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured
        creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three month period ended October
        30,
        2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0
        million
        as additional purchase price for 3dfx.


However,
        the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the
        confirmation process. On December 21, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court determined
        that
        it would schedule trial of one portion of the Trustee’s case against NVIDIA. On
        January 2, 2007, NVIDIA exercised its right to terminate the settlement
        agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward
        confirmation of the Creditors’ Committee’s plan.

In
        addition, while the conditional settlement agreement was awaiting the
        confirmation process, the Bankruptcy Court, over objection of the Creditors’
Committee and NVIDIA, ordered the discovery portion of the Trustee’s litigation
        to proceed. The expert discovery was completed, but the Bankruptcy Court
        also
        ruled on a Trustee discovery motion allowing additional discovery of NVIDIA.
        Because that order would have required NVIDIA to disclose privileged
        attorney-client communications, NVIDIA asked the District Court to review
        that
        order and to stay its execution while the District Court’s review is pending.
        The District Court did issue the requested stay order on August 3, 2006.
        Oral
        argument on that matter was held on November 15, 2006, and the District Court
        reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s order by order of its own dated December 15,
        2006. The District Court permitted certain limited additional discovery,
        but
        concluded that on the record before it, there was no basis to set aside the
        attorney-client privilege.

Following
        the Trustee’s filing of a Form 8-K on behalf of 3dfx, in which the Trustee
        disclosed the terms of the proposed settlement agreement between NVIDIA and
        the
        Creditor’s Committee, certain shareholders of 3dfx filed a petition with the
        Bankruptcy Court to appoint an official committee to represent the claimed
        interests of 3dfx shareholders. That petition was granted and an Equity Holders
        Committee was appointed. Since that appointment, the Equity Holders Committee
        has filed a competing plan of reorganization/liquidation. The Equity Holders
        plan assumes that 3dfx can raise additional equity capital that would be
        used to
        retire all of 3dfx’s debts. Upon the payment of that debt, the Equity Holders
        Committee contends that NVIDIA would be obliged to pay the stock consideration
        provided for in the asset purchase agreement. By virtue of stock splits since
        the execution of the asset purchase agreement, the stock consideration would
        now
        total four million shares of our common stock. The Equity Holders’ Committee
        filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court for an order giving it standing
        to
        bring that lawsuit to enforce the Asset Purchase Agreement. Over our objection,
        the Bankruptcy Court granted that motion on May 1, 2006 and the Equity Holders’
Committee filed its Complaint for Declaratory Relief against NVIDIA that
        same
        day. NVIDIA moved to dismiss the Complaint for Declaratory Relief, and the
        Bankruptcy court granted that motion with leave to amend. The Equity Committee
        thereafter amended its complaint, and NVIDIA moved to dismiss that amended
        complaint as well. At the hearing on December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court
        granted the motion as to one of the Equity Holders’ Committee’s claims, and
        denied it as to the others. However, the Bankruptcy Court also ruled that
        NVIDIA
        would only be required to answer the first three causes of action by which
        the
        Equity Holders’ Committee seeks a determination that the Asset Purchase
        Agreement was not terminated before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy protection,
        that
        the 3dfx bankruptcy estate still holds some rights in the Asset Purchase
        Agreement, and that the agreement is capable of being assumed by the bankruptcy
        estate. In addition, the Equity Holders Committee filed a motion seeking
        Bankruptcy court approval of investor protections for Harbinger Capital Partners
        Master Fund I, Ltd., an equity investment firm that has conditionally agreed
        to
        pay no more than $51.5 million for preferred stock in 3dfx. The hearing on
        that
        motion was held on January 18, 2007, and the court approved the proposed
        protections. Beginning on March 21, 2007, NVIDIA and the Trustee are scheduled
        to try the question of the value of the assets 3dfx conveyed to NVIDIA and,
        in
        particular, whether the price NVIDIA paid for those assets was reasonably
        equivalent to the value of the assets 3dfx sold to NVIDIA.

Lawsuits
        related to our historical stock option granting practices and SEC
        inquiry

In
            June
            2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of NVIDIA, or the Audit Committee,
            began
            a review of our stock option practices based on the results of an internal
            review voluntarily undertaken by management. The Audit Committee, with
            the
            assistance of outside legal counsel, completed its review on November
            13, 2006
            when the Audit Committee reported its findings to our full Board. The
            review
            covered option grants to all employees, directors and consultants for
            all grant
            dates during the period from our initial public offering in January 1999
            through
            June 2006. Based on the findings of the Audit Committee and our internal
            review,
            we identified a number of occasions on which we used an incorrect measurement
            date for financial accounting and reporting purposes.

We
            voluntarily contacted the SEC regarding the Audit Committee’s review and, as of
            the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, the SEC is continuing the inquiry
            of
            our historical stock option grant practices it began in late August 2006.
            In
            October 2006, we met with the SEC and provided it with a review of the
            status of
            the Audit Committee’s review and in November 2006 we voluntarily provided the
            SEC with further documents. We continue to cooperate with the SEC in
            its
            inquiry.

Concurrently
            with our internal review and the SEC’s inquiry, since September 29, 2006, ten
            derivative cases have been filed in state and federal courts asserting
            claims
            concerning errors related to our historical stock option granting practices
            and
            associated accounting for stock-based compensation expense. These complaints
            have been filed in various courts, including the California Superior
            Court,
            Santa Clara County, the United States District Court for the Northern
            District
            of California, and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in
            and for New
            Castle County.

Plaintiffs
            filed a consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for
            the
            Northern District of California on February 28, 2007.

The
            California Superior Court cases

have
            been
            consolidated and plaintiffs are scheduled to file a consolidated complaint
            on or
            before March 22, 2007. All of the

cases
            purport to be brought derivatively on behalf of NVIDIA against members
            of our
            Board and several of our current and former officers and directors.

All

allege
            in substantially similar fashion claims for, among other things, breach
            of
            fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider selling, abuse of control,
            gross
            mismanagement, waste, constructive fraud, and violations of Sections
            10(b) and
            14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. The
            plaintiffs seek to recover for NVIDIA, among other things, damages in
            an
            unspecified amount, rescission, punitive damages, treble damages for
            insider
            selling, and fees and costs. Plaintiffs also seek an accounting, a constructive
            trust and other equitable relief.

We
            intend
            to take all appropriate action in response to these
            complaints.


Opti
          Incorporated

On
          October 19, 2004, Opti Incorporated, or Opti, filed a complaint for patent
          infringement against NVIDIA in the United States District Court for the
          Eastern
          District of Texas. In its complaint, Opti asserted that unspecified NVIDIA
          chipsets infringe five United States patents held by Opti. Opti sought
          unspecified damages for our alleged conduct, attorneys’ fees and triple damages
          for alleged willful infringement by NVIDIA. In April 2006, the District
          Court
          issued a Markman ruling adopting Opti's proposed construction on 13 of
          the 15
          terms at issue and Opti dropped from the lawsuit two of the five United
          States
          patents that Opti alleged NVIDIA infringes, and elected to pursue the three
          remaining patents at trial.

In
          August
          2006, Opti and NVIDIA settled this litigation. Under that settlement, NVIDIA
          was
          obligated to pay to Opti $11.0 million dollars for past and present licenses
          to
          the patents in suit and NVIDIA agreed to make additional quarterly payments
          to
          Opti should NVIDIA use certain patented technology after January 31, 2007.
          The
          case has now been dismissed with prejudice. The agreements with Opti call
          for us
          to pay $11.0 million in exchange for Opti’s dismissal of its lawsuit against us
          and for certain patent license rights. Of this $11.0 million, we recorded
          $8.0
          million as a patent-related intangible asset and $3.0 million as a charge
          to
          cost of revenue.

Department
        of Justice Subpoena and Investigation

On
        November 29, 2006, we received a subpoena from the San Francisco Office of
        the
        Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, in
        connection with the DOJ's investigation into potential antitrust violations
        related to graphics processing units and cards. No specific allegations have
        been made against us. We plan to cooperate with the DOJ in its investigation.
        As
        of March 14, 2007, 42 civil complaints have been filed against us. The
        majority are pending in the Northern District of California, a number are
        pending in the Central District of California, and other cases are pending
        in
        several other Federal district courts. Although the complaints differ, they
        generally purport to assert federal and state antitrust claims based on alleged
        price fixing, market allocation, and other alleged anti-competitive agreements
        between us and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, as a result of its
        acquisition of ATI Technologies, Inc., or ATI. Many of the cases also assert
        a
        variety of state law unfair competition or consumer protection claims on
        the
        same allegations and some cases assert unjust enrichment or other common
        law
        claims. The complaints are putative class actions alleging classes of direct
        and/or indirect purchasers of our graphic processing units and cards. The
        plaintiffs in a few of the Northern District of California actions have filed
        a
        motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation asking that all
        pending and subsequent cases be consolidated in one court for all pre-trial
        discovery and motion practice. A hearing on this motion is set for March
        29,
        2007. We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and
        intend
        to vigorously defend the cases.

Issuer
        Purchases of Equity Securities

On
        August
        9, 2004 we announced that our Board had authorized a stock repurchase program
        to
        repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain specifications,
        up to
        an aggregate maximum amount of $300 million. Subsequently, on March 6, 2006,
        we
        announced that our Board had approved a $400 million increase to the
        original stock repurchase program. As a result of this increase, the amount
        of
        common stock the Board has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased
        to a total of $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time
        in
        the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock
        repurchase programs, in compliance with the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-18,
        subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors.
        The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of
        common
        stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our
        discretion.

As
        part
        of our share repurchase program, we have entered into and we may continue
        to
        enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions.
        These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange
        for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon
        execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares
        of our
        common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the
        agreement. Through the end of fiscal 2007, we have repurchased 27.3 million
        shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of $488.1 million.
        During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered into a structured share
        repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common stock for $125.0
        million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first fiscal
        quarter.

        industry is largely focused on the consumer products market. Due to the
        seasonality in this market, we typically expect to see stronger revenue
        performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the
        back-to-school and holiday seasons.

Fiscal
        2007 Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

GPU
        Business

The
        combination of our GeForce 6, GeForce 7 and GeForce 8 series of GPUs and
        our
        Scalable Link Interface, or SLI, technology has created a new class of gaming
        PCs and professional workstations.  SLI technology takes advantage of the
        increased bandwidth of the peripheral component interconnect, or PCI, Express
        bus architecture to allow up to four NVIDIA-based graphics cards to operate
        in a
        single PC or up to two NVIDIA-based graphics cards to operate in a notebook
        PC
        or professional workstation.

During
        the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we shipped eight new GeForce 7 series GPUs
        for
        desktop and notebook PCs, expanding the offering of products in the GeForce
        GPU family. In March 2006, we shipped our first Quad SLI system for desktop
        PCs,
        enabling the use of four GPUs per system. We also shipped the GeForce Go
        GTX notebook GPU featuring SLI technology for notebook PCs.


During
        the second quarter of fiscal 2007, our NVIDIA GeForce Go notebook GPU product
        line achieved record revenue for the second consecutive quarter. In addition,
        our NVIDIA Quadro professional product line increased its revenue 27% from
        the
        second quarter of fiscal 2006. We transitioned from our NVIDIA GeForce 6600
        to
        the NVIDIA GeForce 7600, which delivers almost a 100% performance increase
        at
        the same price point.

During
        the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we continued to experience growth in sales
        of
        our GeForce 7 series products, primarily in the mainstream and performance
        segments. Our NVIDIA GeForce Go notebook GPU product line achieved record
        revenue for the third consecutive quarter, primarily through increased sales
        in
        the notebook standalone GPU segment.

In
        June
        2006, we shipped the GeForce 7950 GX2, which provides 2500x1600 resolution.
        This
        is the resolution of cinematic film, and brings the 16:9 panoramic experience
        of
        cinema to gaming. We also announced PureVideo High-Definition, or HD technology,
        a combination of hardware acceleration from an NVIDIA GPU, high definition
        movie
        player integration and High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection, or HDCP,
        feature support, to enable manufacturers and consumers to build PCs that
        can
        play High-Definition Digital Video Disc, or HD DVD or Blu-ray
        movies.

In
        August
        2006, we introduced the NVIDIA Quadro Plex 1000, the world's first dedicated
        Visual Computing System. The NVIDIA Quadro Plex 1000 offers scalability in
        a
        desktop or dense 3U rackmount configuration for professional applications
        such
        as those powering multiple streams of 4K high-definition video, 3D styling
        and
        design, scientific and medical visualization, oil and gas exploration, or
        visual
        simulation and training.

In
        November 2006, we introduced our GeForce 8 series GPUs, which is based on
        a
        unified shader architecture. Instead of separate vertex and pixel shading
        processors, the GeForce 8800 has 128 stream processors, operating at 1.35GHz,
        that can process either vertex or pixel shader programs. GeForce 8800 is
        also
        the world’s first DX10 GPU. DX10 is a new Application Programming Interface, or
        API, for Microsoft Windows Vista, or Vista, and includes many new features.
        We
        also announced Compute Unified Device Architecture, or CUDA, a new mode of
        operation on GPUs where the computational power of the GPU can be utilized
        for
        computation-intensive applications.

During
        the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we extended our leadership share position
        in
        the notebook GPU segment to 58% share, according to the Mercury Research
        Fourth
        Quarter 2006 PC Graphics Report. Notebook GPU revenue grew over 120%
        year-over-year. Additionally, the NVIDIA Quadro professional product line
        achieved record revenue with a 24% revenue increase from the fourth quarter
        fiscal 2006.

MCP
        Business

In
        February 2006, we completed our acquisition of ULi Electronics, Inc., or
        ULi, a
        core logic developer for the PC industry. This acquisition represents our
        ongoing investment in our platform solution strategy and has strengthened
        our
        sales, marketing, and customer engineering presence in Taiwan and
        China.

In
        March
        2006, we shipped our first integrated graphics processor, or IGP, core-logic
        solution for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, based notebook PCs - the
        GeForce Go 6100 GPU and NVIDIA nForce Go 430 MCP. This core logic solution
        is
        the industry’s first high-definition IGP to provide hardware accelerated H.264
        high-definition video playback.

In
        May
        2006, we shipped our NVIDIA nForce 590 SLI, a high-performance motherboard
        solution for x86 PC platforms, including those based on socket AM2 processors
        by
        AMD. The NVIDIA nForce 590 SLI can utilize the power of up to four NVIDIA
        GeForce GPUs for HD gaming.

In
        June
        2006, we introduced the NVIDIA nForce 590 SLI for Intel Core2 Duo and Core
        Extreme CPUs.

In
        November 2006, we introduced our new NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI MCPs, which deliver
        performance for Intel Corporation, or Intel, CPUs and are designed specifically
        for enthusiasts with features such as SLI, Dual Net Gigabit Ethernet, and
        MediaShield RAID. The introduction of our NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI MCPs extends
        our nForce products for Intel Corporation, or Intel’s, CPUs with a performance
        platform for Intel’s Core2 Duo and new Core 2 Quad CPUs.


During
        the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the NVIDIA nForce MCP product line achieved
        record revenue for its tenth consecutive quarter. NVIDIA nForce MCP revenue
        grew
        16% sequentially from the third quarter fiscal 2007 and 89% year-over-year.
        Our
        MCP growth was driven in part by increased adoption of our NVIDIA nForce
        notebook solutions by large PC manufacturers.

For
        fiscal 2008, our key growth objectives for our MCP Business are to deliver
        new
        motherboard products for the Intel CPU segment and maintain our leadership
        positions on AMD platforms. We believe that Intel-based consumers will demand
        NVIDIA-branded graphics and system performance.

Handheld
        GPU Business

In
        March
        2006, NVIDIA and Intel announced a collaboration to bring a 3D gaming and
        multimedia platform to handheld devices. The collaboration combines the NVIDIA
        GoForce family of handheld GPUs with Intel processors to deliver a development
        platform to content developers.

Our
        GoForce handheld GPUs ship in the Motorola 3G RAZR V3X, SLVR L6i, SLVR L7i,
        MOTORAZR Maxx, and Sony Ericsson Walkman phones. Our newest handheld GPU,
        the
        NVIDIA GoForce 5500 GPU, has been designed into Digital Video Broadcast -
        Handheld, or DVB-H, phones in North America, Europe, and Integrated Services
        Digital Broadcasting - Terrestrial, or ISDB-T, in Japan.

In
        March
        2006, we acquired Hybrid Graphics Ltd., or Hybrid Graphics, a developer of
        embedded 2D and 3D graphics software for handheld devices.

In
        June
        2006, we launched our MobileMedia Platform for handheld devices running Windows
        Mobile 5.0. The MobileMedia Platform is a development kit, containing both
        software and hardware components, that enables handheld manufacturers to
        design
        and release digital media-rich devices with Windows Mobile 5.0.

In
        January 2007, we completed our acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc., or
        PortalPlayer. Until recently, our Handheld GPU strategy has been to focus
        on
        establishing ourselves in the market as the leader of multimedia technology
        by
        leveraging our expertise in graphics, video, and image processing. With the
        acquisition of PortalPlayer’s expertise in building low power application
        processors for personal media players, or PMPs, we are now focused on delivering
        Systems-On-A-Chip, or SOCs, that combine our application processors and GPUs.
        We
        expect SOCs such as these to power next generation smart phone and PMP
        devices.

Consumer
        Electronics Business

We
        record
        license revenue from our initial agreement with SCE to jointly develop a
        custom
        GPU for SCE’s PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system, as well as from
        certain additional agreements with them. In addition, we record royalty revenue
        from SCE based on per unit sales of the PlayStation 3, which was launched
        by SCE
        in November 2006.

Gross
        Margin Improvement

We
        continue to remain focused on improving our gross margin. Beginning in fiscal
        2005, we implemented profit improvement initiatives across our company which
        were designed to improve business and operational processes. During fiscal
        2007, our gross margin was 42.4%, which represents an increase of over 410
        basis
        points from our gross margin of 38.3% for fiscal 2006. Our gross margin was
        38.3% for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 610 basis points from
        our
        gross margin of 32.2% for fiscal 2005. We will continue to focus on improving
        our gross margin during fiscal 2008.


Restatement

On
            November 29, 2006, we restated our previously-issued financial statements
            for
            fiscal years 2004 through 2006, and for the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
            together with selected financial statement items for earlier years, to
            correct
            errors related to accounting for stock-based compensation expense. In
            June 2006,
            the Audit Committee of the Board of NVIDIA, or the Audit Committee, began
            a
            review of our stock option practices based on the results of an internal
            review
            voluntarily undertaken by management. The Audit Committee, with the assistance
            of outside legal counsel, completed its review on November 13, 2006 when
            the
            Audit Committee reported its findings to our Board of Directors, or the
            Board. The review covered option grants to all employees, directors and
            consultants for all grant dates during the period from our initial public
            offering in January 1999 through June 2006. Based on the findings of
            the Audit
            Committee and our internal review, we identified a number of occasions
            on which
            we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting
            purposes. These errors resulted primarily from our use during our fiscal
            years
            2000, 2001 and 2002, of certain date selection methods discussed below
            which
            resulted in employees receiving options with stated exercise prices lower
            than
            the market prices as measured based upon the actual grant dates. We ceased
            using
            such practices beginning in our fiscal year 2003. The Audit Committee
            found
            that, beginning in our fiscal year 2003, we improved our stock option
            grant
            processes and have generally granted and priced our employee stock options
            in an
            objective and consistent manner since that time. However, for one Company-wide
            annual stock option grant we made in fiscal 2004, we did not finalize
            the number
            of options allocated to each employee as of the stated grant date in
            May 2003,
            which resulted in stock-based compensation charges due to the change
            in the
            measurement date to the date the grants were finalized. The Audit Committee’s
            review did not identify any additional stock-based compensation charges
            from
            measurement date issues subsequent to that fiscal 2004 grant.

As
        a
        result of the measurement date errors identified from the Audit Committee’s
        review, through January 29, 2006, we recorded aggregate non-cash stock-based
        compensation charges of $127.4 million, net of related tax effects. The errors
        resulted in after-tax charges of $1.4 million and $11.7 million for our fiscal
        years 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, the cumulative effect of
        the
        related after-tax charges for periods prior to our fiscal year ended January
        30,
        2005 was $114.2 million. These additional stock-based compensation expense
        charges were non-cash and had no impact on our reported revenue, cash, cash
        equivalents or marketable securities for each of the restated periods. These
        charges were based primarily on

Accounting
        Principles Board Opinion No. 25, or APB No. 25,

Accounting
        for Stock Issued to Employees

(intrinsic value-based) charges and
        associated payroll taxes of $199.6 million on a pre-tax basis, which were
        amortized over the vesting term of the stock options in accordance with
        Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28, or FIN 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option
        or
        Award Plans

. We amortized a substantial portion of these charges to expense
        during our fiscal years 2000 to 2006.

The
        types
        of errors we identified generally fell into the following
        categories:

Improper
        Measurement Dates for Company-Wide Annual or Retention Stock Option
        Grants

.
        We
        determined that, in connection with certain annual or retention stock option
        grants that we made to employees during our fiscal years 2000, 2001, 2002,
        and 2004, the final number of shares that an individual employee was entitled
        to
        receive was not determined and/or the proper approval of the related stock
        option grant had not been given until after the stated grant date. Therefore,
        the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually
        subsequent to the stated grant date, resulting in new measurement dates for
        the
        related options.

Improper
        Measurement Dates for Stock Option Grants during Fiscal Years 2001 and

.
        In
        connection with stock option grants that we made to newly-hired employees
        (and,
        to a much lesser degree, retention grants to existing employees) during fiscal
        years 2001 and 2002, our practice was to grant stock options with an exercise
        price based upon the lowest closing price of our common stock in the last
        few
        days of the month of hire or the last few days of any subsequent month in
        the
        quarter of hire. The selection of the grant date of the related option grants
        would be made at the end of the fiscal quarter and was based on achieving
        the
        lowest exercise price for the affected employees. As a result of these
        practices, the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes
        was
        actually subsequent to the stated grant date, resulting in new measurement
        dates
        for the related options.

Improper
        Measurement Dates for Stock Option Grants during Fiscal Year
        2000.

In
        connection with certain stock option grants to newly-hired employees (and,
        to a
        much lesser degree, retention grants to existing employees) during a portion
        of
        fiscal year 2000, our practice was to delay the selection of the related
        grant
        dates until the end of a two-month period in the fiscal quarter during which
        the
        employees who received the grants began their employment with NVIDIA. As
        a
        result of this practice, the exercise price of the related option grants
        was not
        determined until subsequent to the stated grant date. We also determined
        that,
        during fiscal year 2000, we generally set the grant date and exercise price
        of
        employee option grants for new hires and promotions at the lowest price of
        the
        last few business days of the month of their hire or promotion (or of the
        following month in certain two-month periods that were chosen for an
        indeterminate reason). As a result of these practices, the measurement date
        for
        such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated
        grant
        date, resulting in new measurement dates for the related options. In addition,
        we also determined that the exercise price or the number of options to be
        granted had not been determined, or the proper approval had not been given,
        for
        various other miscellaneous option grants during fiscal year 2000 until after
        the stated grant date - resulting in new measurement dates for accounting
        purposes for the related options.


Other
        Issues Identified.

We also identified instances where stock option grants
        did not comply with applicable terms and conditions of the stock plans from
        which the grants were issued. For example, two grants were made to officers
        of
        NVIDIA by the chief executive officer under delegated authority; however,
        under
        the terms of the applicable plan, the option grant should have been made
        by our
        Board or the Compensation Committee. There were also instances where (1)
        option
        grants were made to a small group of employees who joined NVIDIA pursuant
        to a
        business combination, and to a few other employees in certain instances,
        with
        stated exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on
        the
        actual measurement date of the related grants; and (2) option grants were
        made
        to a few individuals who were contractors rather than employees, without
        recording the appropriate accounting charges. In addition, the Audit Committee
        did not find any evidence that these violations were committed for improper
        purposes.

Critical
        Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s
        discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
        are
        based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
        in
        accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
        The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
        and
        judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
        cost
        of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going
        basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue
        recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, and goodwill.
        We
        base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
        that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
        which
        form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
        liabilities.

We
        believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant
        judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
        statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of
        these
        critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our
        Board. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical
        accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form
        10-K.


Revenue
          Recognition

Product
          Revenue

We
          recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
          exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable
          and
          collection is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase
          order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of
          an
          arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title
          and risk
          of loss have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether
          the
          arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably
          assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured,
          we
          defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably
          assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.

Our
            policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and
            related
            cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product.

We
          record
          estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue
          is
          recognized. Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are
          designed
          to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target
          markets. We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
          Force
          Issue 01-9, or EITF 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to
          a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)

and, as such, we
          accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor.
          Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale,
          unless
          we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed
          rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate.

Our
          customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We
          account
          for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance
          with EITF 01-9. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders,
          OEMs,
          distributors and add-in card partners that are earmarked for market segment
          development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’
activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. If market conditions decline,
          we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs,
          possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such
          programs are offered.

We
        also
        record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for
        estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily
        on
        historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal
        period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales
        return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure
        for
        product returns.

License
        and Development Revenue

For
        license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual
        property components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the
        percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services
        are
        performed. For all license and service arrangements accounted for under the
        percentage-of-completion method, we determine progress to completion based
        on
        actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated
        total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically
        evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to
        complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses
        on
        contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can
        be
        reasonably estimated. To date, we have not recorded any such losses. Costs
        incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs
        on
        uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue
        recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue
        recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of
        projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are
        used to
        estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these
        estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize
        in
        any period.

Accounts
        Receivable

We
        maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses
        resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
        Management determines this allowance, which consists of an amount identified
        for
        specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated
        exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that
        are
        covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. If the financial condition
        of
        our customers, the financial institutions providing letters of credit, or
        our
        credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment
        of
        their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that
        could
        adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance
        that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future. Our current
        credit insurance agreement expires on December 31, 2007.


As
          of
          January 28, 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $1.3
          million and our gross accounts receivable balance was $534.4 million. Of
          the
          $534.4 million, $150.3 million was covered by credit insurance and $19.8
          million
          was covered by letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers
          were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
          payments, additional allowances may be required and we may have to record
          additional reserves or write-offs on certain sales transactions in the
          future.
          As a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance, our allowance
          for
          doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 0.2% and 0.4% during fiscal
          years 2007 and 2006. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of
          gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent
          to
          which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit. As
          of
          January 28, 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented
          0.2% of our gross accounts receivable balance. If our allowance for doubtful
          accounts receivable balance had been recorded at the high end of the range,
          at
          0.4% of our gross receivable balance, then our allowance for doubtful accounts
          receivable balance at January 28, 2007, would have been approximately $2.4
          million, rather than the actual balance of $1.3 million.

Inventories

Inventory
        cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis; which approximates actual
        cost
        on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We write down our inventory for
        estimated lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable inventory
        equal
        to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market
        value
        based upon assumptions about future demand, future product purchase commitments,
        estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions. If actual market
        conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if our
        future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted
        future demand for such products, additional future inventory write-downs
        may be
        required that could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market
        conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margins when products
        are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact
        on
        our gross margin. As of January 28, 2007, our inventory reserve was $39.7
        million. As a percentage of our gross inventory balance, our inventory reserve
        has ranged between 8.9% and 15.9% during fiscal years 2007 and 2006. As of
        January 28, 2007, our inventory reserve represented 10.1% of our gross inventory
        balance. If our inventory reserve balance had been recorded at the high end
        of
        the range, at 15.9% of our gross inventory balance, then our inventory reserve
        balance at January 28, 2007, would have been approximately $62.8 million,
        rather
        than the actual balance of $39.7 million. Inventory reserves once established
        are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or
        scrapped.

Income
        Taxes

Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109,

Accounting
        for Income Taxes

,
        establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of
        income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state
        and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes
        payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We
        also
        recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities,
        as
        appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary
        differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce
        any
        deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available
        evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

United
        States income tax has not been provided on earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries
        to the extent that such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.

Our
        calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on
        certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in
        the
        application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax
        assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality
        to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in
        the
        United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other
        facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential
        United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate
        of
        whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine
        that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability
        is
        less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income
        tax
        benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements,
        accordingly.

As
        of
        January 28, 2007, we had a valuation allowance of $68.6 million. Of
        the total valuation allowance, $3.7 million relates to state tax attributes
        acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred
        tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to potential
        utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes, and
        $64.9 million relates to state deferred tax assets that management
        determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future
        taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related
        to
        certain acquisitions becomes probable, recognition of these acquired tax
        benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero, then reduce other non-current
        intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit
        reported as a reduction to income tax expense. To the extent realization
        of the
        deferred tax assets related to state tax benefits becomes probable, we would
        recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than
        not
        to be realized.


As
          of
          January 28, 2007, with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
          Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R),

Share Based Payment

, we
          have derecognized both deferred tax assets for the excess of tax benefit
          related
          to stock-based compensation, reflected in our federal and state net operating
          loss and research tax credit carryforwards, and the offsetting valuation
          allowance. Consistent with prior years, the excess tax benefit reflected
          in our
          net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, in the amount
          of
          $344.9 million as of January 28, 2007, will be accounted for as a credit
          to
          stockholders’ equity, if and when realized. In determining if and when excess
          tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to do so on a
“with-and-without” approach with respect to such excess tax benefits. We have
          also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation
          deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes, and specifically
          to
          recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing
          operations.

Goodwill

Our
        impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in
        which the goodwill resides to its carrying value.  We determined that our
        reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes
        of
        completing our Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS
        No. 142,

Goodwill
        and Other Intangible Assets

,
        impairment test.  We utilize a two-step approach to testing goodwill for
        impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair
        value-based test. In computing fair value of our reporting units, we use
        estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows from such units. The second
        step, if necessary, measures the amount of such an impairment by applying
        fair
        value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to perform
        our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
        year. We completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth
        quarter of fiscal 2007 and concluded that there was no impairment. However,
        future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future
        periods due to the potential for a write-down of goodwill in connection with
        such tests.

Stock-based
        Compensation

Effective
        January 30, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
        123(R)

which
        establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services.
        Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based
        on
        the fair value of the awards, and is recognized as expense over the requisite
        employee service period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during
        fiscal 2007 was $116.7 million, which consisted of stock-based compensation
        expense related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Please
        refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
        information.

We
        elected to adopt the modified prospective application method beginning January
        30, 2006 as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). We recognize stock-based compensation
        expense using the straight-line attribution method.

We
        estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a
        lattice-binomial model. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we recorded
        stock-based compensation expense equal to the amount that would have been
        recognized if the fair value method was used, for the purpose of the pro
        forma
        financial information provided in accordance with

Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, or SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
        for Stock-Based Compensation

,
        as
        amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting
        for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosures

.

At
        the
        beginning of fiscal 2006, we transitioned from a Black-Scholes model to a
        binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock-based
        compensation awards granted under our stock option plans. The determination
        of
        fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an
        option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions
        regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables
        include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over
        the
        term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise
        behaviors, vesting schedules, death and disability probabilities, expected
        volatility and risk-free interest.

Our
        management determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be
        more
        reflective of market conditions and, therefore, could reasonably be expected
        to
        be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility.

The
        risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates
        appropriate for the term of our employee stock options. The dividend yield
        assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts.
        W

e
        began
        segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous
        exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using
        the binomial valuation model.

Using
        the
        lattice-binomial model

,
        the
        fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans have
        been
        estimated using the following assumptions during the year ended January 28,

:

For
        our
        employee stock purchase plan we continue to use the Black-Scholes model.
        The
        fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan has

SFAS
          No. 123(R) also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant
          and
          revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
          from
          those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.
          If
          factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of
          SFAS
          No. 123(R) in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under
          SFAS
          No. 123(R) may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current
          period.

Litigation,
      Investigation and Settlement Costs

From
      time
      to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory
      bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However,
      there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations,
      and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against
      us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial
      settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and
      results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information
      becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending
      litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably
      estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
      However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may
      be
      materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record
      additional costs.

Revenue

We
      report
      financial information for four product-line operating segments to our Chief
      Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker,
      as follows: the GPU Business, the MCP Business, the Handheld GPU Business,
      and
      the Consumer Electronics Business

.
      Revenue
      in the "All Other" category is primarily derived from sales of memory
      devices.  Please refer to Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements for further information.

Fiscal
      2005 was a 53-week year, compared to fiscal years 2007 and 2006 which were
      52-week years, and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive
      impact on our revenue in fiscal 2005.  However, we are not able to quantify
      the effect of the slightly longer year on our fiscal 2005 revenue.

Fiscal
        Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006

Revenue
        was $3.07 billion for fiscal 2007, compared to $2.38 billion for fiscal 2006,
        which represents an increase of 29.2%. A discussion of our revenue results
        for
        each of our operating segments is as follows:

GPU
        Business

.
        GPU
        Business revenue increased by 20.3% to $1.99 billion for fiscal 2007, compared
        to $1.66 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was a result of increased
        sales
        of our desktop GPU products, notebook products and our NVIDIA professional
        workstation products. The increase in sales of our desktop GPU products was
        led
        by our GeForce 7-based and GeForce 8-based products that serve the high-end
        segment. Sales of our NVIDIA notebook products improved due to an increased
        mix
        of GeForce 7-based products, shipping for notebook PC design wins based on
        Intel’s Napa platform. This increase in sales was slightly offset by a decrease
        in average selling prices. Our NVIDIA professional workstation product sales
        increased due to an increase in unit shipments, offset by a slight decrease
        in average selling prices.

MCP
      Business

.
      MCP
      Business revenue was $661.5 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $352.3 million
      for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 87.8%. The overall
      increase in MCP business revenue is primarily due to sales of newer NVIDIA
      nForce4 products, NVIDIA nForce5 products, integrated AMD-based desktop
      products, and integrated Intel-based desktop products, which began shipping
      after the second quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, revenue also increased
      as
      a result of our acquisition of ULi in February 2006.

Handheld
      GPU Business

.
      Handheld GPU Business revenue was $108.5 million for fiscal 2007, compared
      to
      $58.7 million for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 84.7%. The
      overall increase in Handheld GPU Business revenue is due to an increase in
      unit
      sales of high-end feature cellular phone and PDA products.

Consumer
      Electronics Business.

Consumer
      Electronics Business revenue was $96.3 million for fiscal 2007, compared to
      $167.4 million for fiscal 2006, which represents a decrease of 42.5%. This
      decrease is a result of discontinued sales of our Xbox-related products to
      Microsoft, partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual
      development arrangements. We recognized revenue from the sale of our
      Xbox-related products to Microsoft for the last time during the second quarter
      of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we recognized $92.9 million of revenue
      from
      our contractual arrangements with SCE for its PlayStation3, compared
      to $49.0 million of revenue recognized during fiscal 2006.

For
      the
      first quarter of fiscal 2008, we expect a seasonal decline associated with
      the
      PC business. Although we believe our market and competitive position in each
      of
      our business units continues to be strong, there are no significant industry
      growth drivers to offset seasonality. Microsoft’s next generation operating
      system, Microsoft Windows Vista, or Vista, has shipped. We believe that Vista
      is
      the first operating system to present, as a standard, the power of the GPU to
      all applications and that, in the future, a significant percentage of PCs will
      have Vista. With Vista, DX10, and HD/Blu-ray DVD as the technologies for PCs
      for
      the coming year, we believe that 3D graphics will become a central part of
      the
      computing experience and that the GPU will be more important than ever. However,
      to date we have not seen a significant impact from the launch of
      Vista.

Fiscal
      Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005

Revenue
      was $2.38 billion for fiscal 2006, compared to $2.01 billion for fiscal 2005,
      which represents an increase of 18.2%. A discussion of our revenue results
      for
      each of our operating segments is as follows:

GPU
      Business

.
      GPU
      Business revenue increased by 22.9% to $1.66 billion for fiscal 2006 compared
      to
      $1.35 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase was the result of increased sales
      of
      our GeForce 6 and GeForce 7 families of desktop GPUs that serve the high-end
      GPU
      segment, offset by a slight decline in sales of our mainstream GPU products.
      In
      addition, sales of our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products and
      notebook products continued to improve due to an increased mix of GeForce
      6-based and GeForce 7-based products, which resulted in an increase in average
      selling prices.


MCP
      Business

.

MCP Business revenue was $352.3 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $175.7
      million for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 100.6%. The
      overall increase in MCP Business revenue is primarily due to increased sales
      of
      NVIDIA nForce4 products, which we began selling during the fourth quarter of
      fiscal 2005, and an increase in average selling prices. The overall increase
      was
      offset by a decrease in sales of NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce2 products.

Handheld
      GPU Business

.

Handheld GPU Business revenue was $58.7 million for fiscal 2006, compared to
      $45.9 million for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 27.9%. The
      overall increase in Handheld GPU Business revenue is due to an increase in
      average selling prices of high-end feature phone products and revenue recognized
      as a result of a development contract.

Consumer
      Electronics Business

. Consumer Electronics Business revenue was $167.4
      million for fiscal 2006, compared to $260.0 million for fiscal 2005, which
      represents a decrease of 35.6%. The decrease in our Consumer Electronics
      Business is a result of decreased and discontinued sales of our Xbox-related
      products to Microsoft, partially offset by revenue recognized from our
      contractual arrangement with SCE. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006,
      Microsoft indicated that it would not order any more Xbox-related products
      from
      us after our second fiscal quarter. As a result, we recognized revenue from
      the
      sale of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft for the last time during the
      second quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, we recognized $49.0 million
      of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a
      custom GPU for SCE’s PlayStation3. No such revenue was recognized during our
      fiscal 2005 as our definitive agreement with SCE was not executed until the
      first quarter of fiscal 2006.

Concentration
      of Revenue

Revenue
      from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas
      accounted for 83.6%, 84.0% and 75.9% of total revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006,
      and
      2005, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual
      countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed
      even
      if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs’, add-in board and
      motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a
      different location. The increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to
      customers outside of the United States and other Americas for fiscal 2006 as
      compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to discontinued sales of XGPUs and
      MCPs used in the Microsoft Xbox product during fiscal 2006, which were billed
      to
      Microsoft in the United States.

Sales
      to
      our significant customers accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue
      from one customer during fiscal year 2007, 26% of our total revenue from two
      customers during fiscal year 2006, and 31% of our total revenue from two
      customers during fiscal year 2005.

Gross
      Profit

Gross
      profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue.
      Cost
      of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from
      subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging,
      manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such
      purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping
      costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and
      service arrangements. Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue.
      Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of
      products sold. Our gross margin was 42.4%, 38.3%, and 32.2% for fiscal years
      2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A discussion of our gross margin results
      for
      each of our operating segments is as follows:

Fiscal
      Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006

GPU
      Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to
      fiscal 2006, primarily due to the sale of our GeForce 8 series GPUs and
      increased sales of our GeForce 7 series GPUs, which collectively accounted
      for
      approximately 70% of our GPU Business revenue. Our GeForce 8 and our
      GeForce 7 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our previous
      generations of GPUs.

MCP
      Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our MCP Business decreased during fiscal 2007 as compared to
      fiscal 2006, primarily due to a shift in product mix to higher volumes of
      integrated AMD-based desktop products which have experienced lower gross margins
      than our discrete MCP products, and inventory reserves that we recorded as
      a
      charge to cost of revenue that primarily related to purchase commitments that
      we
      believed had exceeded future demand.


Handheld
      GPU
      Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business increased during fiscal 2007 as
      compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in unit sales of high-end
      feature cellular phone and PDA products which generally have higher gross
      margins than our previous Handheld GPU products.

Consumer
      Electronics Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business increased during fiscal 2007
      as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to license and royalty revenue from
      our contractual development arrangements that have higher gross margins compared
      to the gross margin of Xbox products shipped in fiscal 2006.

Fiscal
      Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005

GPU
      Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to
      fiscal 2005, primarily due to the sale of our GeForce 7 series GPUs and
      increased sales of our GeForce 6 series GPUs, which collectively accounted
      for
      approximately 78% of our fiscal 2006 GPU Business revenue. Our GeForce 7
      and our GeForce 6 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our
      GeForce FX series GPUs which comprised 53% of our fiscal 2005 GPU Business
      revenue. In addition, average selling prices from our notebook GeForce 7 and
      GeForce 6 series GPU products increased as a larger percentage of our total
      notebook revenue during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

MCP
      Business

.

The
      gross
      margin of our MCP Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal
      2005, primarily due to the increase in revenue from sales of our NVIDIA nForce3
      and NVIDIA nForce4 products, which to date have experienced higher gross margins
      than previous generations of NVIDIA nForce products.

Handheld
      GPU Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as
      compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the inventory write-off of certain
      handheld products in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.

Consumer
      Electronics Business

.
      The
      gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business increased during fiscal 2006
      as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the reduction of die costs for
      Xbox-related products, and the recognition of revenue from our contractual
      arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCE’s PlayStation3.

Consolidated
      Gross Margin

The
      improvement in our gross margin reflects our continuing focus on delivering
      cost
      effective product architectures, enhancing business processes and delivering
      profitable growth. We expect gross margin to remain flat or improve
      slightly during the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

(1)

Stock-based
      compensation includes charges/credits relating to payroll taxes accrued for
      as
      part of the restatement.


Research
      and
      development expenses increased by $196.4 million, or 55%, from fiscal 2006
      to
      fiscal 2007 primarily due to a $75.2 million increase in salaries and benefits
      related to 1,014 additional personnel and a $64.2 million increase in
      stock-based compensation due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) during the
      first quarter of fiscal 2007. In-process research and development expense,
      or
      IPR&D, increased by $14.0 million as a result of our acquisitions of
      PortalPlayer and Hybrid Graphics during fiscal 2007. Depreciation and
      amortization increased $1.6 million due to emulation hardware and software
      programs that were purchased during fiscal 2006, resulting in a full year of
      depreciation in fiscal 2007 compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal
      2006. Computer software and equipment increased $11.2 million primarily due
      to
      increased allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased
      $6.4 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both of which
      were
      based on the growth in headcount. New product development increased by $7.1
      million as a result of costs related to an overall increase in the number of
      product tape-outs and in prototype materials. License and development project
      costs decreased by $10.5 million primarily due to the inversed impact of
      decreased development costs related to our collaboration with SCE and other
      engineering costs related to a different development contract. Certain of our
      personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts
      have
      spent time working on these development projects. The cost associated with
      the
      time these individuals spend working on development projects is allocated from
      research and development to cost of revenue or is capitalized on our balance
      sheet. During fiscal 2007, less time was spent working on development projects
      so less cost was allocated to cost of revenue or capitalized and, therefore,
      more cost remained in research and development. Other expenses increased $6.2
      million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated
      with the expansion of our international sites including our acquisitions of
      ULi
      and Hybrid Graphics.

Research
      and development expenses increased by $8.9 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2005
      to
      fiscal 2006 primarily due to a $32.5 million increase in salaries and benefits
      related to 423 additional personnel and a $5.3 million increase in computer
      software and equipment primarily due to increased allocation of information
      technology expenses. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.1 million due
      to
      increased purchases of hardware and software equipment and facilities increased
      $0.6 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both of which
      were
      based on the growth in headcount. Other expenses increased $3.9 million
      primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with
      the
      expansion of our international sites. These increases were offset by a decrease
      in stock-based compensation expense of $8.2 million and an increase of $26.9
      million in license and development project costs, primarily related to increased
      development costs related to our collaboration with SCE and other engineering
      costs related to a different development contract. Certain of our personnel
      who
      usually devote their time to research and development efforts have spent time
      working on these development projects. The cost associated with the time these
      individuals spend working on development projects is allocated from research
      and
      development to cost of revenue or is capitalized on our balance sheet. During
      fiscal 2006, more time was spent working on development projects so more cost
      was allocated to cost of revenue or capitalized and, therefore, less cost
      remained in research and development.

We
      anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research
      and
      development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in
      the
      foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of
      products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to
      fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental
      investments in research and development and these investments may be independent
      of our level of revenue.

Sales,
      General and Administrative

(1)

Stock-based
      compensation includes charges/credits relating to payroll taxes accrued for
      as
      part of the restatement.


Sales,
      general and administrative expenses increased $91.4 million, or 45%, from fiscal
      2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a $40.7 million increase in stock-based
      compensation resulting from our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) during the
      first quarter of fiscal 2007 and a $30.7 million increase in salaries and
      benefits related to 201 additional personnel. Legal and accounting fees
      increased by $7.2 million primarily due to our internal review of historical
      stock option granting practices and the restatement of prior year financial
      results. Advertising and promotions increased by $14.1 million due to travel
      and
      other employee costs associated with our international expansion. These
      increases were offset by a decrease of $2.9 million in other expenses related
      to
      reimbursement from collection settlements.

Sales,
      general and administrative expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1%, from fiscal
      2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a a $17.2 million decrease in advertising
      and promotion costs, primarily associated with a reduction in certain marketing
      programs, tradeshow expenses, new product launches and customer samples, other
      marketing costs, travel related and employee recruitment expenses. In addition,
      stock-based compensation expense decreased by $5.9 million and depreciation
      and
      amortization decreased by $4.5 million. These decreases were offset by a $13.9
      million increase in salaries and benefits related to 122 additional personnel
      and a $6.1 million increase in legal expenses primarily due to certain insurance
      reimbursements that we received during fiscal 2005 that reduced this expense,
      and increased litigation activity during fiscal 2006 related to 3dfx
      Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, and American Video Graphics, LP, or AVG. In addition
      there were increases of $2.9 million in facility expense due primarily to the
      expansion of our international sites and $2.6 million in other general and
      administrative expenses, offset by a reduction in bad debt expense.

Operating
      Expenses

We
      anticipate that our operating expenses will be relatively flat in the first
      quarter of fiscal 2008. We believe that even with the additional expense from
      our acquisition of PortalPlayer, we may be able to keep operating expenses
      flat
      as we focus on expense controls and restrict headcount additions in the first
      quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal
      2007.

In-process
      research and development

In
      connection with our acquisition of Hybrid Graphics in March 2006 and
      PortalPlayer in January 2007, we wrote-off $0.6 million and $13.4 million,
      respectively, of IPR&D, that had not yet reached technological feasibility
      and had no alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No. 2,

      assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria must be charged to
      expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price.

Settlement
      Costs

Settlement
      costs were $14.2 million for fiscal 2006. The settlement costs are associated
      with two litigation matters, 3dfx and AVG. AVG is settled. For further
      information about the 3dfx matter, please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest
      Income and Interest Expense

Interest
      income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable
      securities. Interest income increased from $20.7 million to $41.8 million from
      fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the result of higher average
      balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest
      rates in fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006. Interest income increased
      from $11.4 million to $20.7 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily
      due to the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and
      marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 when compared
      to
      fiscal 2005.

Other
      Income (Expense), net

Other
      income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale
      of marketable securities. There were no significant changes in other income
      from
      fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. However, other income decreased by $1.1 million
      from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the liquidation of
      marketable securities during fiscal 2006 in order to obtain the cash needed
      for
      the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation
      Act of 2004.

Income
        Taxes

We
        recognized income
        tax expense of $46.4 million, $55.6 million and $18.4 million during fiscal
        years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage
        of
        income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 9.4% in fiscal
        2007,
        15.6% in fiscal 2006, and 17.2% in fiscal 2005.

The
        difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily
        a
        result of changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax, with the
        additional change in mix in fiscal 2007 due to certain stock-based compensation
        expensed for financial accounting purposes under SFAS No. 123(R) and an
        increase in the research tax credit benefit in fiscal 2007.

Please
          refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
          further
          information regarding the components of our income tax expense.

As
      of
      January 28, 2007, we had $1.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
      securities, an increase of $167.6 million from the end of fiscal 2006. Our
      portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several
      financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier
      investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain
      limits on our portfolio duration.

Operating
      activities generated cash of $587.1 million, $446.4 million, and $132.2 million
      during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The annual cash provided
      by operating activities in amounts greater than net income is due primarily
      to
      non-cash charges to earnings and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock
      options. Non-cash charges to earnings included stock-based compensation and
      depreciation and amortization on our long-term assets. Upon adoption of SFAS
      No.
      123(R) in fiscal 2007, non-cash charges to earnings included $116.7 million
      of
      stock-based compensation expense and related deferred income tax
      impact. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2006
      when compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the $212.6 million
      increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. On
      our
      consolidated balance sheet, accrued liabilities increased $77.2 million from
      fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the recording of income taxes
      payable for fiscal 2006, the increase in accruals related to customer programs
      and the recording of $30.6 million in relation to 3dfx, of which $25.0 million
      was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. Accounts payable decreased $58.8
      million and inventories decreased $60.9 million from fiscal 2005 to
      fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of significant reductions in older
      products, offset by an increase in new products. Accounts receivable increased
      $21.9 million primarily due to increased sales and improved linearity of sales,
      and cash collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to
      the
      fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

Investing
      activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable
      securities, acquisition of businesses and purchases of property and equipment,
      which include leasehold improvements for our facilities, and intangible assets.
      Investing activities used cash of $540.8 million, $41.8 million and $152.0
      million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used
      by
      investing activities during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to $401.8 million
      of
      cash used for our acquisitions of PortalPlayer, ULi and Hybrid Graphics during
      the fiscal year. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities included
      capital expenditures of $145.3 million attributable to purchases of new research
      and development equipment, hardware equipment, technology licenses, software,
      intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our various facilities. These
      uses of cash were offset by $6.2 million of net proceeds from sales of
      marketable securities. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal
      was primarily due to $79.6 million for capital expenditures primarily
      attributable to purchases of new research and development equipment, hardware
      equipment, technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold
      improvements at our headquarters facility in Santa Clara, California and at
      our
      international sites. In addition, we used cash of $12.1 million for our
      acquisition of a private company and $9.7 million for the investments we made
      during fiscal 2006 in non-affiliated companies. These uses of cash were offset
      by $59.6 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.

Net
      cash
      used by investing activities during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to $84.7
      million of net purchases of marketable securities. In addition, we used $67.3
      million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of
      leasehold improvements for our new data center at our headquarters campus,
      new
      research and development emulation equipment, technology licenses, software
      and
      intangible assets. We expect to spend approximately $120 million to $140 million
      for capital expenditures during fiscal 2008, primarily for purchases of software
      licenses, emulation equipment, computers and engineering workstations. In
      addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of
      new
      businesses or assets.


Financing
        activities used cash of $53.6 million, $61.4 million and provided cash of
        $13.8
        million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Net
        cash
        used by financing activities in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to $275.0 million
        paid towards our stock repurchase program, offset by cash proceeds of $221.2
        million from common stock issued under employee stock plans. Cash used in
        fiscal
        2006 resulted primarily from $188.5 million related to our stock repurchase
        program, offset by $127.5 million of common stock issued under employee stock
        plans.

Stock
      Repurchase Program

On
      August
      9, 2004 we announced that our Board had authorized a stock repurchase program
      to
      repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain specifications, up
      to
      an aggregate maximum amount of $300 million. Subsequently, on March 6, 2006,
      we
      announced that our Board had approved a $400 million increase to the
      original stock repurchase program. As a result of this increase, the amount
      of
      common stock the Board has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased
      to a total of $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time
      in
      the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock
      repurchase programs, in compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
      or
      the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal
      requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire
      any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any
      time at our discretion.

As
      part
      of our share repurchase program, we have entered into and we may continue to
      enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions.
      These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange
      for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon
      execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of
      our
      common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the
      agreement. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 10.3 million shares of our common
      stock for $275.0 million under structured share repurchase transactions, which
      we recorded on the trade date of the transaction. Through the end of fiscal
      2007, we have repurchased 27.3 million shares under our stock repurchase program
      for a total cost of $488.1 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008,
      we
      entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares
      of
      our common stock for $125.0 million that we expect to settle prior to the end
      of
      our first fiscal quarter.

Operating
      Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements

We
      believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from
      operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital
      requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance
      that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this
      time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or
      at
      all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require
      additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are
      unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital
      equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm
      our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from
      operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital
      include:

·

decreased
      demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products;

·

inability
      to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation
      products;

·

competitive
      pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;
      and

·

new
      product announcements or product introductions by our competitors.

For
      additional factors see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Operations
      - Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our
      operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or
      investors, our stock price could decline.”

3dfx
      Asset Purchase

On
      December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries
      entered into an agreement, which closed on April 18, 2001, to purchase certain
      graphics chip assets from 3dfx.

Under
      the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the
      closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant
      to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement
      also provided, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly
      certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for, then
      we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common
      stock. If 3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly
      certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0
      million, then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the
      amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our
      common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by
      $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and
      liabilities had been provided for, or could not be satisfied, for less than
      $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any
      additional consideration for the assets.


In
      October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United
      States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. In March 2003,
      we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy
      Court which sought, among other things, payments from us as additional purchase
      price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx. In early November
      2005,
      after many months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured
      Creditors, or the Creditors’ Committee, reached a conditional settlement of the
      Trustee’s claims against NVIDIA. This conditional settlement, presented as the
      centerpiece of a proposed Plan of Liquidation in the bankruptcy case, was
      subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review
      and
      approval of the Bankruptcy Court after notice and hearing. The Trustee advised
      that he intended to object to the settlement, which would have called for a
      payment by NVIDIA of approximately $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under
      the
      settlement, $5.6 million related to various administrative expenses and Trustee
      fees, and $25.0 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities
      owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three
      month period ended October 30, 2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to
      settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx.

However,
      the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the
      confirmation process. On December 21, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court determined
      that
      it would schedule trial of one portion of the Trustee’s case against NVIDIA. On
      January 2, 2007, NVIDIA exercised its right to terminate the settlement
      agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward
      confirmation of the Creditors’ Committee’s plan. Beginning on March 21, 2007,
      NVIDIA and the Trustee are scheduled to try the question of the value of the
      assets 3dfx conveyed to NVIDIA and, in particular, whether the price NVIDIA
      paid
      for those assets was reasonably equivalent to the value of the assets 3dfx
      sold
      to NVIDIA.

Represents
      our inventory purchase commitments as of January 28, 2007.

During
      the fiscal year 2007, we entered into a confidential patent licensing
      arrangement. Our commitment for future license payments under this arrangement
      could range from $97.0 million to $110.0 million over a ten year period;
      however, the net outlay under this arrangement may be reduced by the occurrence
      of certain events covered by the arrangement.

Off-Balance
      Sheet Arrangements

As
      of
      January 28, 2007, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined
      in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).

Recently
      Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
      July
      2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation
      No. 48, or FIN 48,

Accounting
      for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

.
      FIN 48
      applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement
      109,

Accounting
      for Income Taxes

.
      Under
      FIN 48 a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it
      is
      more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based
      solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a
      company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are
      recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of
      previously recognized tax benefits, and describes the methods for classifying
      and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any
      unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 also addresses when a company should record
      interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and
      penalties may be classified within the financial statements.  Any
      differences between tax liability amounts recognized in the statements of
      operations as a result of adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a
      cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings.
      FIN
      48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
      provisions of FIN 48 will be effective as of first quarter of fiscal 2008.
      We
      believe that the cumulative effect of adoption of FIN 48 will not result in
      any
      material change to the beginning balance of our retained earnings.


In
      September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      157, or SFAS No. 157,

Fair
      Value Measurements

.
      SFAS
      No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
      about fair value measurements. The changes to current practice resulting from
      the application of this Statement relate to the definition of fair value, the
      methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair
      value measurements. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 157
      beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 29, 2007. We do not believe
      the
      adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated
      financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
      September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, or SAB No.
      108,

Considering
      the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in
      Current Year Financial Statements

,
      which
      provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal
      of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year
      misstatement. We adopted the provisions of SAB No. 108 in our fiscal year 2007.
      The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
      financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
      February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      159, or SFAS No. 159,

The
      Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
      Liabilities

.
      SFAS
      No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial
      instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that
      unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
      elected be reported in earnings. We are required to adopt the provisions of
      SFAS
      No. 159 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 27, 2008, although
      earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that
      SFAS
      No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of
      operations or cash flows.

ITEM
      7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest
      Rate Risk

We
      invest
      in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments
      in
      commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of
      corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies.
      These investments are denominated in United States dollars.

We
      account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.
      All of
      the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and
      floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate
      risk.
      Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to
      a
      rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income
      than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future
      investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
      rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities
      that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because
      we classify our debt securities as “available-for-sale”, no gains or losses are
      recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold
      prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than
      temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related
      unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income,
      a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax.

As
      of
      January 28, 2007, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed
      rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the
      yield curve of both +/- 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values
      for
      these investments of approximately $3.0 million.

Exchange
      Rate Risk

We
      consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be
      minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers
      provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are
      not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United
      States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more
      expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely,
      decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies
      could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing
      business with us. To date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging
      activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency
      exchange rates could harm our business in the future.

      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls
      and Procedures

Disclosure
      Controls and Procedures

Based
      on
      their evaluation as of January 28, 2007, our management, including our
      Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our
      disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
      Exchange Act) were effective.

Management’s
      Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
      Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
      management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
      we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting as of January 28, 2007 based on the criteria set forth
      in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
      on
      our evaluation under the criteria set forth in

Internal
      Control — Integrated Framework

,
      our
      management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
      effective as of January 28, 2007.

Our
      management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting as of January 28, 2007 has been audited by
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
      as
      stated in their report which is included herein.

Changes
      in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There
      were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our
      last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
      to
      materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
      Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our
      management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
      does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
      controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter
      how
      well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
      assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
      of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
      and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
      of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
      can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
      if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

ITEM 15.

EXHIBITS,
      FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES


REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
      FIRM

To

the
      Stockholders and Board of Directors

NVIDIA
      Corporation

:

We
      have
      completed integrated audits of NVIDIA Corporation

’s
      consolidated

financial
      statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of January
      28, 2007, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States).

Our
      opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
      fina

ncial
      statements and financial statement schedule

In
      our
      opinion, the

consolidated

financial statements listed in the

index
      appearing under Item 15(a)(2)

present
      fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NVIDIA
      Corporation

and
      its
      subsidiaries at January 28, 2007 and January 29, 2006, and the results of their
      operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
      January 28, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
      in
      the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
      statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
      Item 15(a)(2)

presents
      fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read
      in
      conjunction with the related consolidated financial statem

ents.
      These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
      responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
      opinion on these financial statements and financial statement

schedule

based

on our
      audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
      standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
      Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
      assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
      misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
      basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
      made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
      We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
      opinion.

As
      discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the
      Company changed the manner in which it accounts for stock-based compensation
      in
      fiscal 2007.

Internal
      control over financial reporting

Also,
      in
      our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Annual Report on
      Internal Control over Financial Reporting

appearing
      under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over
      financial reporting as of January 28, 2007 based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
      is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
      Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2007,
      based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
      internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
      is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness
      of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
      We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
      accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
      (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
      to
      obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
      financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of
      internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
      of
      internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
      testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
      control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
      circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
      opinions.

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
      (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
      necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
      of
      the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
      and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
      regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
      or
      disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
      financial statements.


Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
      1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our
      Company

NVIDIA
      Corporation is the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor
      technologies. Our products are designed to enhance the end-user experience
      on
      consumer and professional computing devices. We have four major product-line
      operating segments: graphics processing units, or GPUs, media and communications
      processors, or MCPs, Handheld GPUs, and Consumer Electronics. Our GPU Business
      is composed of products that support desktop personal computers, or PCs,
      notebook PCs, professional workstations and other GPU-based products; our MCP
      Business is composed of NVIDIA nForce products that operate as a single-chip or
      chipset that provide system functions, such as high speed storage and network
      communications, and perform these operations independently from the host central
      processing unit, or CPU; our Handheld GPU Business is composed of products
      that
      support handheld personal digital assistants, or PDAs, cellular phones and
      other
      handheld devices; and our Consumer Electronics Business is concentrated in
      products that support video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics
      devices and is composed of our contractual arrangements with Sony Computer
      Entertainment, or SCE, to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCE’s PlayStation3,
      sales of our Xbox-related products, revenue from our license agreement with
      Microsoft relating to the successor product to their initial Xbox gaming
      console, the Xbox360, and related devices. We were incorporated in
      California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Our
      headquarter facilities are in Santa Clara, California.

Fiscal
      year

We
      operate on a 52 or 53-week year, ending on the Sunday nearest January 31.
      Fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were 52-week years, compared to fiscal 2005
      which was a 53-week year.

Stock
      Split

In
      March
      2006, our Board of Directors, or the Board, approved a two-for-one stock split
      of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a 100%
      stock dividend. The stock split was effective on Thursday, April 6, 2006 for
      stockholders of record at the close of business on Friday, March 17, 2006.
      All
      share and per-share numbers contained herein have been retroactively adjusted
      to
      reflect this stock split.

Reclassifications

Certain
      prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current
      fiscal year presentation.

Principles
      of Consolidation

Our
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation
      and
      its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and
      transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use
      of Estimates

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
      and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
      and
      disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
      statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
      period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an on-going basis,
      we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,
      accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes and contingencies. These
      estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that
      we
      believe are reasonable.


NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

Revenue
      Recognition

Product
      Revenue

We
      recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
      exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable
      and
      collection is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase
      order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an
      arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and
      risk
      of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms. At the point
      of
      sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and
      whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of
      a
      fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the
      time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt
      of
      payment.

Our
      policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related
      cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product.

We
      record
      estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is
      recognized. Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed
      to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target
      markets. We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
      Issue 01-9, or EITF 01-09,

Accounting
      for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of
      the
      Vendor’s Products)

and, as
      such, we accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage
      factor. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale,
      unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate.
      Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate,

Our
      customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We account
      for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance
      with EITF 01-09. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders,
      original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, distributors and add-in card partners
      that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically
      are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA
      products. If market conditions decline, we may take actions to increase amounts
      offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction
      of revenue at the time such programs are offered.

We
      also
      record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for
      estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily
      on
      historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal
      period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales
      return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for
      product returns.

License
      and Development Revenue

For
      license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual
      property components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the
      percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services
      are
      performed. For all license and service arrangements accounted for under the
      percentage-of-completion method, we determine progress to completion based
      on
      actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated
      total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically
      evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to
      complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses on
      contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can
      be
      reasonably estimated. To date, we have not recorded any such losses. Costs
      incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on
      uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue
      recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue
      recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of
      projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used
      to
      estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these
      estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize
      in
      any period.

Advertising
      Expenses

We
      expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising
      expenses for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $14.8 million, $9.2 million,
      and $15.2 million, respectively.

Rent
      Expense

We
      recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and have
      accrued for rent expense incurred, but not paid.

Product
      Warranties

We
      generally offer limited warranty to end-users that range from one to three
      years
      for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing
      defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated
      cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue
      recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited
      warranty to customers for certain products.

Foreign
      Currency Translation

We
      use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our
      subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured
      into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets
      and liabilities, including inventories, prepaid expenses and other current
      assets, property and equipment, deposits and other assets and equity, are
      remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured
      at
      average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses
      related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured
      at
      historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement
      are included in “Other income (expense), net” and to date have not been
      significant. The aggregate exchange gain (loss) included in determining net
      income was $(0.5) million in fiscal 2007, $0.01 million in fiscal 2006 and
      $0.04
      million in fiscal 2005.

Cash
      and Cash Equivalents

We
      consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity
      of
      three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of
      January 28, 2007, our cash and cash equivalents were $544.4 million, which
      includes $467.2 million invested in money market funds.

Marketable
      Securities

We
      account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

All of
      our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Cash equivalents consist of
      financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original
      maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Marketable
      securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with a maturity of
      greater than three months when purchased and some equity investments. We
      classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition in the
      available-for-sale category as our intention is to convert them into cash for
      operations. These securities are reported at fair value with the related
      unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income
      (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. We follow the guidance
      provided by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-01,

The
      Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
      Investments

,
      in
      order to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are
      other
      than temporarily impaired. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable
      securities are determined using the specific-identification method.

Inventories

Inventory
      cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost
      on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily
      of
      the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer
      fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs,
      including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield
      fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. We write down our inventory
      for estimated amounts related to lower of cost or market, obsolescence or
      unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
      and
      the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, future
      product purchase commitments, estimated manufacturing yield levels and market
      conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
      by management, or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers
      exceed our forecasted future demand for such products, additional future
      inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating
      results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher
      gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not
      had a significant impact on our gross margin. Inventory reserves once
      established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or
      scrapped.

Property
      and Equipment

Property
      and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
      straight-line method based on estimated useful lives, generally three to five
      years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under
      capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases
      are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life
      of
      the asset.

Goodwill

We
      account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

.
      Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during our fourth quarter
      of
      our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using
      a
      fair value-based approach. Our impairment review process compares the fair
      value
      of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying
      value. For the purposes of completing our SFAS
      No. 142 impairment test, we perform our analysis on a
      reporting unit basis. We utilize a two-step approach to testing goodwill
      for impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a
      fair
      value-based test. In computing fair value of our reporting units, we use
      estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows from such units. The second
      step, if necessary, measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair
      value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to perform
      our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
      year. We completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth
      quarter of fiscal 2007 and concluded that there was no impairment. However,
      future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings due to the
      potential for a write-down of goodwill in connection with such
      tests.

Concentration
      of Credit Risk

Financial
      instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist
      primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts
      receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment
      grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our
      portfolio duration. All marketable securities are held in our name, managed
      by
      several investment managers and held by one major financial institution under
      a
      custodial arrangement. One customer accounted for approximately 18% of our
      accounts receivable balance at January 28, 2007. We perform ongoing credit
      evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for
      potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for
      specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our
      overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and
      letters of credit.

Impairment
      of Long-Lived Assets

In
      accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, or
      SFAS No. 144,

Accounting
      for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

long-lived
      assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to
      amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
      circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
      recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
      comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future
      cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of
      an
      asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is
      recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
      the
      fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined based on the estimated
      discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Assets
      and
      liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated
      balance sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying
      amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.

Fair
      Value of Financial Instruments

The
      carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
      and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively
      short maturities as of January 28, 2007 and January 29, 2006.
      Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are
      reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included
      in
      accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’
equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based
      on quoted market prices.

Accounting
      for Asset Retirement Obligations

We
      account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, or SFAS No. 143,

Accounting
      for Asset Retirement Obligations

,
      which
      addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with
      the
      retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
      costs. SFAS No. 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the
      retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
      development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No. 143 requires that the
      fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized
      in
      the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can
      be
      made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the
      associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the
      life of the asset. During fiscal years 2006 and 2007, we recorded asset
      retirement obligations to return the leasehold improvements to their original
      condition upon lease termination at our headquarters facility in Santa Clara,
      California and our leasehold improvements at our international sites. At January
      28, 2007 and January 29, 2006, our net asset retirement obligations were $6.4
      million and $6.5 million, respectively.

Income
      Taxes

Statement
      of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109,

Accounting
      for Income Taxes

,
      establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of
      income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state
      and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes
      payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also
      recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as
      appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary
      differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce
      any
      deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available
      evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.

United
      States income tax has not been provided on earnings of our
      non-United States subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are
      considered to be permanently reinvested.

Our
      calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on
      certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in
      the
      application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax
      assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality
      to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the
      United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other
      facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential
      United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of
      whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine
      that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability
      is
      less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income
      tax
      benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements,
      accordingly.

Litigation,
      Investigation and Settlement Costs

From
      time to time, we are
      involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are
      aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many
      uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot
      be
      certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be
      resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement
      payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of
      operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes
      available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending
      litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably
      estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
      However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may
      be
      materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record
      additional costs.

Comprehensive
      Income

Comprehensive
      income consists of net income and other comprehensive income or loss. Other
      comprehensive income or loss components include unrealized gains or losses
      on
      available-for-sale securities, net of tax.

Net
      Income Per Share

Basic
      net
      income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
      outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using
      the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares
      outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the
      treasury stock method, the effect of stock options outstanding is not included
      in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect
      is anti-dilutive. The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and
      denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for
      the
      periods presented:

Diluted
      net income per share does not include the effect of anti-dilutive common
      equivalent shares from stock options outstanding of 8.9 million,
      11.6 million and 27.4 million for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
      respectively. The weighted average exercise price of stock options excluded
      from
      the computation of diluted earnings per share was $30.14, $17.79 and $13.93
      for
      fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Recently
      Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
      July
      2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation
      No. 48, or FIN 48,

Accounting
      for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

.
      FIN 48
      applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement
      109,

Accounting
      for Income Taxes

.
      Under
      FIN 48 a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it
      is
      more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based
      solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a
      company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are
      recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of
      previously recognized tax benefits, and describes the methods for classifying
      and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any
      unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 also addresses when a company should record
      interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and
      penalties may be classified within the financial statements.  Any
      differences between tax liability amounts recognized in the statements of
      operations as a result of adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a
      cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings.
      FIN
      48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
      provisions of FIN 48 will be effective as of first quarter of fiscal 2008.
      We
      believe that the cumulative effect of adoption of FIN 48 will not result in
      any
      material change to the beginning balance of our retained earnings.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      157, or SFAS No. 157,

Fair
      Value Measurements

.
      SFAS
      No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
      about fair value measurements. The changes to current practice resulting from
      the application of this Statement relate to the definition of fair value, the
      methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair
      value measurements. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 157
      beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 29, 2007. We do not believe
      the
      adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated
      financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
      September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, issued Staff
      Accounting Bulletin No. 108, or SAB No. 108,

Considering
      the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in
      Current Year Financial Statements

,
      which
      provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal
      of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year
      misstatement. We adopted the provisions of SAB No. 108 in our fiscal year 2007.
      The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
      financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
      February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      159, or SFAS No. 159,

The
      Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
      Liabilities.

.
      SFAS
      No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial
      instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that
      unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
      elected be reported in earnings. We are required to adopt the provisions of
      SFAS
      No. 159 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 27, 2008, although
      earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that
      SFAS
      No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of
      operations or cash flows.

Note
      2 - Stock-Based Compensation

Effective
      January 30, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
      Payment

.
      SFAS
      No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee
      services. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date,
      based on the fair value of the awards, and is recognized as expense over the
      requisite employee service period.

Prior
      to the adoption of
      SFAS No. 123(R)

Prior
      to
      the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion
      No. 25, or APB No. 25,

Accounting
      for Stock Issued to Employees

,
      and
      related interpretations to account for our stock-based employee compensation
      plans. As such, compensation expense was recorded if on the date of grant the
      current fair value per share of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise
      price
      per share. We provided the disclosures required under Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 123, or SFAS No. 123,

Impact
      of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)

We
      elected to adopt the modified prospective application method beginning January
      30, 2006 as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly, during fiscal 2007, we
      recorded stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to, but
      not
      yet vested, as of January 29, 2006, equal to the amount that would have been
      recognized if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under
      SFAS
      No. 123 had been in effect for expense recognition purposes, adjusted for
      estimated forfeitures. For options granted in fiscal 2007, we measured
      compensation expense under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). We recognized
      stock-based compensation expense using the straight-line attribution method.
      Previously reported amounts have not been restated. The effect of stock-based
      compensation expense, net of associated payroll taxes, for the year ended
      January 28, 2007 on net income was as follows:

Cumulative
      Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

The
      adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting
      change of $0.7 million for the three months ended April 30, 2006, which reflects
      the net cumulative impact of estimating forfeitures in the determination of
      period expense by reversing the previously recognized cumulative compensation
      expense related to those forfeitures, rather than recording forfeitures when
      they occur as previously permitted.

The
      income statement includes stock-based compensation expense, net of associated
      payroll taxes, and amounts capitalized as inventory, as
      follows:

Prior
      to
      adopting SFAS No. 123(R), we presented all tax benefits resulting from the
      exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in our Statement of Cash
      Flows. However, as required by our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) during the twelve
      months ended January 28, 2007, we began classifying cash flows resulting from
      gross tax benefits as a part of cash flows from financing activities. Gross
      tax
      benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for exercised options
      in
      excess of cumulative compensation cost for those instruments recognized in
      our
      consolidated financial statements. The effect of this change in classification
      on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows resulted in cash used from
      operations of $0.2 million and cash provided from financing activities of $0.2
      million for the year ended January 28, 2007.

As
      of
      January 29, 2006, we had unearned stock-based compensation related to stock
      options of $167.9 million before the impact of estimated forfeitures. In our
      pro
      forma footnote disclosures prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we
      accounted for forfeitures upon occurrence. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures
      to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent
      periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Accordingly, as
      of
      January 30, 2006, we estimated that stock-based compensation expense for the
      awards that are not expected to vest was $32.4 million, and, therefore, the
      unearned stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was adjusted
      to $135.5 million after estimated forfeitures.

During
      the twelve months ended January 28, 2007, we granted approximately 11.9 million
      stock options with an estimated total grant-date fair value of $138.4 million,
      and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $11.78 per option. Of this
      amount, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the
      awards that are not expected to vest was $26.7 million.

As
      of
      January 28, 2007, the aggregate amount of unearned stock-based compensation
      expense related to our stock options was $167.6 million, adjusted for estimated
      forfeitures, which we will recognize over an estimated weighted average
      amortization period of 2.0 years.

Approximately
      $1.6 million of stock-based compensation was capitalized as inventory for the
      twelve months ending January 28, 2007.

Stock-based
      compensation expense that would have been recorded under APB No. 25 during
      the
      twelve months ended January 28, 2007 was approximately $3.0 million. Upon our
      adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we reclassified the unearned stock-based
      compensation expense balance of approximately $3.6 million that would have
      been
      recorded under APB No. 25 to additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated
      Balance Sheet. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) reduced our basic and diluted
      earnings per share by $0.28 and $0.25, respectively, for the year ended January
      28, 2007.

Valuation
      Assumptions

At
      the
      beginning of fiscal 2006, we transitioned from a Black-Scholes model to a
      binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock-based
      compensation awards granted under our stock option plans.  As a result of
      regulatory guidance, including SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, or SAB
      No.
      107,

Share-Based
      Payment

,
      and in
      anticipation of the impending effective date of SFAS No. 123(R), we reevaluated
      the assumptions we used to estimate the value of employee stock options and
      shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan, beginning with stock
      options granted and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan in
      the
      first quarter of fiscal 2006.  At that time, our management also determined
      that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market
      conditions and, therefore, could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator
      of our expected volatility than historical volatility.

Additionally,
      in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we began segregating options into groups
      for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to
      calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation
      model.  As such, the expected term assumption used in calculating the
      estimated fair value of our stock-based compensation awards using the binomial
      model is based on detailed historical data about employees' exercise behavior,
      vesting schedules, and death and disability probabilities.  Our management
      believes the resulting binomial calculation provides a more refined estimate
      of
      the fair value of our employee stock options. For our employee stock purchase
      plan we continued to use the Black-Scholes model. The fair value of stock
      options granted under our stock option plans, and shares issued under our
      employee stock purchase plan have been estimated at the date of grant using
      a
      straight-line attribution method with the following assumptions:

Equity
      Incentive Program

Overview

.

We
      consider equity compensation to be long term compensation and an integral
      component of our efforts to attract and retain exceptional executives, senior
      management and world-class employees. We believe that properly structured equity
      compensation aligns the long-term interests of stockholders and employees by
      creating a strong, direct link between employee compensation and stock
      appreciation, as stock options are only valuable to our employees if the value
      of our common stock increases after the date of grant.

PortalPlayer,
      Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan

We
      assumed the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 stock incentive plan, or the 2004 Plan,
      and
      all related outstanding options in connection with our acquisition of
      PortalPlayer, Inc., or PortalPlayer, on January 5, 2007. The 2004 Plan was
      adopted by the PortalPlayer stockholders in 2004 and as of January 28, 2007,
      1,017,644 shares of NVIDIA common stock were authorized for issuance under
      the
      2004 Plan. In addition, any shares subject to outstanding options under the
      PortalPlayer 1999 stock option plan that expire unexercised or any unvested
      shares that are forfeited will be available for issuance under the 2004 Plan.
      The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2004 Plan will be
      increased on January 1 from 2007 through 2009 by 460,033 shares and on
      January 1 from 2010 through 2014 by 276,000 or a number of shares
      determined by the Board.

Each
      option we assumed in connection with our acquisition of PortalPlayer has been
      converted into the right to purchase that number of shares of NVIDIA common
      stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of PortalPlayer common
      stock underlying such option by 0.3601 and then rounding down to the nearest
      whole number of shares. The exercise price per share for each assumed option
      has
      been similarly adjusted by dividing the exercise price by 0.3601 and then
      rounding up to the nearest whole cent. Vesting schedules and expiration dates
      for the assumed options did not change.

Under
      the
      2004 Plan, options generally vest as to 25% of the shares one year after the
      date of grant and as to 1/48th of the shares each month thereafter and expire
      ten years from the date of grant.

PortalPlayer,
      Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan

We
      assumed options issued under the PortalPlayer, Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan,
      or
      the 1999 Plan, when we completed our acquisition of PortalPlayer on January
      5,
      2007. The 1999 Plan was terminated upon completion of PortalPlayer’s initial
      public offering of common stock in calendar 2004. No shares of common stock
      are
      available for issuance under the 1999 Plan other than to satisfy exercises
      of
      stock options granted under the 1999 Plan prior to its termination and any
      shares that become available for issuance as a result of expiration or
      cancellation of an option that was issued pursuant to the 1999 Plan shall become
      available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. Previously authorized yet unissued
      shares under the 1999 Plan were cancelled upon completion of PortalPlayer’s
      initial public offering.

Each
      option we assumed in connection with our acquisition of PortalPlayer has been
      converted into the right to purchase that number of shares of NVIDIA common
      stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of PortalPlayer common
      stock underlying such option by 0.3601 and then rounding down to the nearest
      whole number of shares. The exercise price per share for each assumed option
      has
      been similarly adjusted by dividing the exercise price by 0.3601 and then
      rounding up to the nearest whole cent. Vesting schedules and expiration dates
      did not change.

Under
      the
      1999 Plan, incentive stock options were granted at a price that was not less
      than 100% of the fair market value of PortalPlayer’s common stock, as determined
      by its board of directors, on the date of grant. Non-statutory stock options
      were granted at a price that was not less than 85% of the fair market value
      of
      PortalPlayer’s common stock, as determined by its board of directors, on the
      date of grant.

Generally,
      options granted under the 1999 Plan are exercisable for a period of ten years
      from the date of grant, and shares vest at a rate of 25% on the first
      anniversary of the grant date of the option, and an additional 1/48th of the
      shares upon completion of each succeeding full month of continuous employment
      thereafter.

      Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan

On
      August 1, 2000, our Board approved the 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive
      Plan, or the 2000 Plan, to provide for the issuance of our common stock to
      employees and affiliates who are not directors, executive officers or 10%
      stockholders. The 2000 Plan provides for the issuance of nonstatutory stock
      options, stock bonuses, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock
      unit
      awards and stock appreciation rights. Options granted under the 2000 plan
      generally expire in six to 10 years from the date of grant. The Compensation
      Committee appointed by the Board, or the Compensation Committee, has the
      authority to amend the 2000 Plan and to determine the option term, exercise
      price and vesting period of each grant. Options granted to new employees prior
      to February 10, 2004, generally vest ratably over a four-year period,
      with 25% becoming vested approximately one year from the date of grant and
      the
      remaining 75% vesting on a quarterly basis over the next three years. From
      February 10, 2004, initial options granted to new employees generally vest
      ratably quarterly over a three-year period. Grants to existing employees in
      recognition of performance generally vest as to 25% of the shares two years
      and
      three months after the date of grant and as to the remaining 75% of the shares
      subject to the option in equal quarterly installments over a nine month
      period. We amended our 2000 Plan in October 2006 to add the ability to
      issue restricted stock unit awards and stock appreciation rights and make
      certain other modifications. There were a total of 21,939,202 shares authorized
      for issuance and 18,776,119 shares available for future issuance under the
      Plan as of January 28, 2007.

      Equity
      Incentive Plan

The
      Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1998 Plan, was adopted by our Board on
      February 17, 1998 and was approved by our stockholders on April 6,
      1998 as an amendment and restatement of our then existing Equity Incentive
      Plan
      which had been adopted on May 21, 1993. The 1998 Plan provides for the
      issuance of our common stock to directors, employees and consultants. The 1998
      Plan provides for the issuance of stock bonuses, restricted stock purchase
      rights, incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. There were a
      total of 110,094,385 shares authorized for issuance and 2,570,982 shares
      available for future issuance under the 1998 Plan as of January 28, 2007.

Pursuant
      to the 1998 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options is at least
      100% of the fair market value on the date of grant or for employees owning
      in
      excess of 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock, 110% of the fair
      market value on the date of grant. For nonstatutory stock options, the exercise
      price must be no less than 85% of the fair market value on the date of grant.

Option
      grants issued under the 1998 Plan generally expire in six to ten years from
      the
      date of grant. Vesting periods are determined by the Board or the Compensation
      Committee. Initial option grants to new employees made after February 10,
      2004 under the 1998 Plan generally vest ratably quarterly over a three year
      period. Subsequent option grants generally vest up to 25% of the shares two
      years and three months after the date of grant and as to the remaining 75%
      of
      the shares subject to the option in quarterly installments over a nine month
      period.

      Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan

In
      February 1998, our Board adopted the 1998 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option
      Plan, or the Directors’ Plan, to provide for the automatic grant of
      non-qualified options to purchase shares of our common stock to our directors
      who are not employees or consultants of us or of an affiliate of us.

In
      July
      2000, the Board amended the 1998 Plan to incorporate the automatic grant
      provisions of the Directors’ Plan into the 1998 Plan. Future automatic grants to
      non-employee directors will be made according to the terms of the Directors’
Plan, but will be made out of the 1998 Plan until such time as shares may become
      available for issuance under the amended Directors’ Plan. In May 2002, and
      subsequently in March 2006, the Directors’ Plan was amended further to reduce
      the number of shares granted to our non-employee directors. The altered
      automatic grant provisions of the Directors’ Plan are also incorporated into the
      1998 Plan. The terms of the amended Directors’ Plan are described below.

Under
      the
      amended Directors’ Plan, each non-employee director who is elected or appointed
      to our Board for the first time is automatically granted an option to purchase
      90,000 shares, which vests quarterly over a three-year period, or Initial Grant.


NVIDIA
      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

On
      August 1 each year, each non-employee director is automatically granted an
      option to purchase 30,000 shares, or Annual Grant. These Annual Grants will
      begin vesting on the second anniversary of the date of the grant and vest
      quarterly during the next year. The Annual Grants will be fully vested on the
      third anniversary of the date of the grant, provided that the director attended
      at least 75% of the meetings during the year following the date of the grant.

On
      August 1 of each year, each non-employee director who is a member of a
      committee of the Board, except for the Nominating and Corporate Governance
      Committee, will automatically be granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares,
      or
      the Committee Grant. The Committee Grants vests in full on the first anniversary
      of the date of the grant, provided that the director has attended at least
      75%
      of the meetings during the year following the date of the grant. Directors
      who
      were members of two committees, Messrs. Cox, Gaither and Jones, waived their
      grant of an additional 10,000 shares for being a member of a second committee
      in
      fiscal 2005 and 2006.

If
      a
      non-employee director fails to attend at least 75% of the regularly scheduled
      meetings during the year following the grant of an option, rather than vesting
      as described previously, the Committee Grants will vest annually over four
      years
      following the date of grant at the rate of 10% per year for the first three
      years and 70% for the fourth year, and the Annual Grants will vest 30% upon
      the
      three-year anniversary of the grant date and 70% for the fourth year, such
      that
      in each case the entire option will become fully vested on the four-year
      anniversary of the date of the grant. For Annual Grants and Committee Grants,
      if
      the person has not been serving on the Board or committee since a prior year’s
      annual meeting, the number of shares granted will be reduced pro rata for each
      full quarter prior to the date of grant during which such person did not serve
      in such capacity.

The
      Compensation Committee administers the amended Directors’ Plan. A total of
      1,200,000 shares have been authorized and issued under the amended Directors’
Plan of which none is available for future issuance as of January 28, 2007.
      As described above, future grants to non-employee directors will be made out
      of
      the 1998 Plan.

      Employee
      Stock Purchase Plan

In
      February 1998, our Board approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or
      the
      Purchase Plan. In June 1999, the Purchase Plan was amended to increase the
      number of shares reserved for issuance automatically each year at the end of
      our
      fiscal year for the next 10 years (commencing at the end of fiscal 2000 and
      ending 10 years later in 2009) by an amount equal to 2% of the outstanding
      shares on each such date, including on an as-if-converted basis preferred
      stock and convertible notes, and outstanding options and warrants, calculated
      using the treasury stock method; provided that the maximum number of shares
      of
      common stock available for issuance from the Purchase Plan could not exceed
      52,000,000 shares. The number of shares will no longer be increased annually
      as
      we reached the maximum permissible number of shares at the end of fiscal 2006.
      There are a total of 52,000,000 shares authorized for issuance. At
      January 28, 2007, 18,857,690 shares have been issued under the Purchase
      Plan and 33,142,310 shares are available for future issuance.

The
      Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under
      Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Purchase Plan, the
      Board has authorized participation by eligible employees, including officers,
      in
      periodic offerings following the adoption of the Purchase Plan. Under the
      Purchase Plan, separate offering periods shall be no longer than 27 months.
      Under the current offering adopted pursuant to the Purchase Plan, each offering
      period is 24 months, which is divided into four purchase periods of 6 months.

Employees
      are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us
      as
      designated by the Board. Employees who participate in an offering may have
      up to
      10% of their earnings withheld pursuant to the Purchase Plan up to certain
      limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the
      purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage
      at
      its discretion, up to 15%. The price of common stock purchased under the
      Purchase Plan will be equal to the lower of the fair market value of the common
      stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the purchase date
      of
      each offering period at 85% at the fair market value of the common stock on
      the
      relevant purchase date. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, employees purchased
      approximately 3.8 million, 3.6 million, and 4.0 million shares with
      weighted-average prices of $6.42, $5.59, and $4.36 per share, respectively,
      and
      grant-date fair values of $3.64, $1.70, and $1.57 per share, respectively.
      Employees may end their participation in the Purchase Plan at any time during
      the offering period, and participation ends automatically on termination of
      employment with us and in each case their contributions are refunded.

Note
      3 - 3dfx

During
      fiscal year 2002, we completed the purchase of certain assets from 3dfx
      Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
      $74.2 million. On December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect
      subsidiaries entered into an agreement, which closed on April 18, 2001, to
      purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx.

Under
      the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the
      closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant
      to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement
      also provided, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly
      certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for, then
      we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common
      stock. If 3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly
      certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0
      million, then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the
      amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our
      common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by
      $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and
      liabilities had been provided for, or could not be satisfied, for less than
      $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any
      additional consideration for the assets.

In
      October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United
      States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. In March 2003,
      we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy
      Court which sought, among other things, payments from us as additional purchase
      price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx. In early November
      2005,
      after many months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured
      Creditors, or the Creditors’ Committee, reached a conditional settlement of the
      Trustee’s claims against NVIDIA. This conditional settlement, presented as the
      centerpiece of a proposed Plan of Liquidation in the bankruptcy case, was
      subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review
      and
      approval of the Bankruptcy Court after notice and hearing. The Trustee advised
      that he intended to object to the settlement, which would have called for a
      payment by NVIDIA of approximately $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under
      the
      settlement, $5.6 million related to various administrative expenses and Trustee
      fees, and $25.0 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities
      owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three
      month period ended October 30, 2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to
      settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx.

However,
      the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the
      confirmation process. On December 21, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court determined
      that
      it would schedule trial of one portion of the Trustee’s case against NVIDIA. On
      January 2, 2007, NVIDIA exercised its right to terminate the settlement
      agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward
      confirmation of the Creditors’ Committee’s plan. Beginning on March 21, 2007,
      NVIDIA and the Trustee are scheduled to try the question of the value of the
      assets 3dfx conveyed to NVIDIA and, in particular, whether the price NVIDIA
      paid
      for those assets was reasonably equivalent to the value of the assets 3dfx
      sold
      to NVIDIA.

The
      3dfx
      asset purchase price of $95.0 million and $4.2 million of direct transaction
      costs were allocated based on fair values presented below. The final allocation
      of the purchase price of the 3dfx assets is contingent upon the outcome of
      all
      of the 3dfx litigation. Please see Note 12 for further information regarding
      this litigation.

Note
      4 - Business Combinations

On
      February 20, 2006, we completed our acquisition of ULi Electronics, Inc., or
      ULi, a core logic developer for the personal computer, or PC, industry. The
      acquisition represents our ongoing investment in our platform solution strategy
      and has strengthened our sales, marketing, and customer engineering presence
      in
      Taiwan and China. The aggregate purchase price consisted of cash
      consideration of approximately $53.1 million.

On
      March
      29, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Hybrid Graphics Ltd., or Hybrid
      Graphics, a developer of embedded 2D and 3D graphics software for handheld
      devices. The aggregate purchase price consisted of cash consideration of
      approximately $36.7 million.

On
      January 5, 2007, we completed our acquisition of PortalPlayer, a leading
      supplier of semiconductors, firmware, and software for personal media players,
      or PMPs, and secondary display-enabled computers. We believe that the
      acquisition will accelerate our ongoing investment in our handheld product
      strategy. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, we paid cash consideration
      of approximately $344.9 million in exchange for common stock in PortalPlayer
      and
      recognized an additional purchase price of $2.9 million, the value of
      approximately 658,000 options of NVIDIA common stock issued upon conversion
      of
      outstanding PortalPlayer stock options.

We
      allocated the purchase price of each of these acquisitions to tangible assets,
      liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired, as well as in-process
      research and development, or IPR&D, if identified, based on their estimated
      fair values. The excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values was
      recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets
      acquired was based on estimates and assumptions determined by management.
      Purchased intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
      respective useful lives. The allocation of the purchase price has been prepared
      on a preliminary basis and reasonable changes are expected as additional
      information becomes available.

The
      following is a summary of estimated fair values of the assets we acquired and
      liabilities we assumed as of January 28, 2007 for acquisitions we completed
      in
      fiscal 2007:

In
      computing fair value of our reporting units, we use estimates of future
      revenues, costs and cash flows from such units. The amount of goodwill allocated
      to our GPU, MCP, Handheld GPU, Consumer Electronics, and All Other segments
      as
      of January 28, 2007, was $99.3 million, $46.2 million, $137.7 million,
      $11.9 million, and $6.3 million, respectively.  As of January 29,
      2006, the amount of goodwill allocated to our GPU, MCP, Handheld GPU, Consumer
      Electronics, and All Other segments, was $99.3 million, $15.1 million, $12.7
      million, $11.9 million, and $6.3 million, respectively. Please refer to
      Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
      segment information.

The
      increase in the gross carrying amount of acquired intellectual property as
      of
      January 28, 2007 as compared to January 29, 2006 is primarily related to $3.1
      million, $8.4 million and $11.6 million of intangible assets that resulted
      from
      our acquisitions of ULi, Hybrid Graphics and PortalPlayer, respectively, during
      fiscal 2007. Please refer to Note 4 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements for further information. In addition, the $10.9 million increase
      in
      the gross carrying amount of patents is related primarily to patents licensed
      from Opti Incorporated, or Opti, for $8.0 million as a result of the license
      and
      settlement agreements described in Note 12 of our Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements.

During
      fiscal 2007, we entered into a confidential patent licensing arrangement. As
      part of this arrangement, we recorded a charge of $16.0 million to the cost
      of
      revenue category in our statement of income related to past usage of certain
      patents subject to the arrangement. Our commitment for future license payments
      under this arrangement could range from $97.0 million to $110.0 million over
      a
      ten year period; however, the net outlay under this arrangement may be reduced
      by the occurrence of certain events covered by the arrangement. The increase
      in
      the gross carrying amount of technology licenses as of January 28, 2007 when
      compared to January 29, 2006 is primarily related to approximately $14.4 million
      committed by us during fiscal 2007 under this arrangement.

Amortization
      expense associated with intangible assets for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005
      was $19.8 million, $16.9 million and $19.7 million, respectively. Future
      amortization expense for the net carrying amount of intangible assets at
      January 28, 2007 is estimated to be $17.1 million in fiscal 2008,

$11.1
      million in fiscal 2009,

$6.9
      million in fiscal 2010, $2.8 million in fiscal 2011, $2.0 million in fiscal
      2012, and $5.6 million in fiscal 2013 and thereafter.

Note
      7 - Marketable Securities

We
      account for our investment instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.
      All of
      our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as
“available-for-sale” under SFAS No. 115. Cash equivalents consist of
      financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original
      maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Marketable
      securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with a maturity of
      greater than three months when purchased and some equity investments. We
      classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition in the
      available-for-sale category as our intention is to convert them into cash for
      operations. These securities are reported at fair value with the related
      unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income
      (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. Realized gains and
      losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the
      specific-identification method. Net realized losses for fiscal years 2007 and
      2006 were $0.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

As
      of
      January 28, 2007, we had 87 investments that were in an unrealized loss
      position with an average unrealized loss duration of less than one year. The
      gross unrealized losses related to fixed income securities were due to changes
      in interest rates. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on
      investment securities at January 28, 2007 are temporary in nature. We
      review our investments to identify and evaluate investments that have
      indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether
      a
      loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value
      has
      been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects
      of the investee, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period
      of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Our
      investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities,
      the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration.

The
      amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable
      securities classified as available-for-sale at January 28, 2007 and
      January 29, 2006 by contractual maturity are shown below.

All

      intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related
      agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be

Note

Stock
      Repurchase Program

On
      August
      9, 2004 we announced that our Board had authorized a stock repurchase program
      to
      repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain specifications, up
      to
      an aggregate maximum amount of $300 million. Subsequently, on March 6, 2006,
      we
      announced that our Board had approved a $400 million increase to the
      original stock repurchase program. As a result of this increase, the amount
      of
      common stock the Board has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased
      to a total of $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time
      in
      the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock
      repurchase programs, in compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
      or
      the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal

As
      part
      of our share repurchase program, we have entered into and we may continue to
      enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions.
      These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange
      for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon
      execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of
      our
      common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the
      agreement. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 10.3 million shares of our common
      stock for $275.0 million under structured share repurchase transactions, which
      we recorded on the trade date of the transaction. Through the end of fiscal
      2007, we have repurchased 27.3 million shares under our stock repurchase program
      for a total cost of $488.1 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008,
      we
      entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares
      of

Litigation

3dfx

On
      December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries
      entered into an agreement to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx
      which closed on April 18, 2001.

In
      May
      2002, we were served with a California state court complaint filed by the
      landlord of 3dfx’s San Jose, California commercial real estate lease,
      CarrAmerica. In December 2002, we were served with a California state court
      complaint filed by the landlord of 3dfx’s Austin, Texas commercial real estate
      lease, Carlyle Fortran Trust. The landlords’ complaints both asserted claims
      for, among other things, interference with contract, successor liability and
      fraudulent transfer and seek to recover, among other things, amounts owed on
      their leases with 3dfx in the aggregate amount of approximately $15 million.
      In
      October 2002, 3dfx filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United
      States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. The landlords’
actions were subsequently removed to the United States Bankruptcy Court for
      the
      Northern District of California and consolidated, for purposes of discovery,
      with a complaint filed by the Trustee in the 3dfx bankruptcy case. Upon motion
      by NVIDIA in 2005, the District Court withdrew the reference to the Bankruptcy
      Court and the landlord actions were removed to the United States District Court
      for the Northern District of California. On November 10, 2005, the District
      Court granted our motion to dismiss the landlords’ respective amended complaints
      and allowed the landlords to have until February 4, 2006 to amend their
      complaints. The landlords re-filed claims against NVIDIA in early February
      2006,
      and NVIDIA again filed motions requesting the District Court to dismiss all
      such
      claims. The District Court took both motions under submission. On September
      29,
      2006, the court dismissed the CarrAmerica action in its entirety and without
      leave to amend. The court found, among other things, that CarrAmerica lacks
      standing to bring the lawsuit and that such standing belongs exclusively to
      the
      bankruptcy trustee. On October 27, 2006, CarrAmerica filed a notice of appeal
      from that order. On December 15, 2006, the District Court also dismissed the
      Carlyle complaint in its entirety, finding that Carlyle lacked standing to
      pursue some of its claims, and that certain other claims were substantively
      unmeritorious. NVIDIA has filed motions to recover its litigation costs and
      attorneys fees against both Carlyle and Carr. Those motions are currently
      scheduled for hearing in early April, 2007.

In
      March
      2003, we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the
      Bankruptcy Court to represent the interests of the 3dfx bankruptcy estate.
      The
      Trustee’s complaint asserts claims for, among other things, successor liability
      and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us. On October 13,
      2005, the Court held a hearing on the Trustee’s motion for summary adjudication.
      On December 23, 2005, the Court issued its ruling denying the Trustee’s Motion
      for Summary Adjudication in all material respects and holding that NVIDIA is
      prevented from disputing that the value of the 3dfx transaction to NVIDIA was
      less than $108.0 million. The Court expressly denied the Trustee’s request to
      find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to NVIDIA were at least $108.0
      million. In early November 2005, after many months of mediation, NVIDIA and
      the
      Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, or the Creditors’ Committee, reached
      a conditional settlement of the Trustee’s claims against NVIDIA. This
      conditional settlement, presented as the centerpiece of a proposed Plan of
      Liquidation in the bankruptcy case, was subject to a confirmation process
      through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court
      after notice and hearing. The Trustee advised that he intended to object to
      the
      settlement, which would have called for a payment by NVIDIA of approximately
      $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million related
      to
      various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million related
      to
      the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured
      creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three month period ended October
      30,
      2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million
      as additional purchase price for 3dfx.

However,
      the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the
      confirmation process. On December 21, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court determined
      that
      it would schedule trial of one portion of the Trustee’s case against NVIDIA. On
      January 2, 2007, NVIDIA exercised its right to terminate the settlement
      agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward
      confirmation of the Creditors’ Committee’s plan.

      CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

In
      addition, while the conditional settlement agreement was awaiting the
      confirmation process, the Bankruptcy Court, over objection of the Creditors’
Committee and NVIDIA, ordered the discovery portion of the Trustee’s litigation
      to proceed. The expert discovery was completed, but the Bankruptcy Court also
      ruled on a Trustee discovery motion allowing additional discovery of NVIDIA.
      Because that order would have required NVIDIA to disclose privileged
      attorney-client communications, NVIDIA asked the District Court to review that
      order and to stay its execution while the District Court’s review is pending.
      The District Court did issue the requested stay order on August 3, 2006. Oral
      argument on that matter was held on November 15, 2006, and the District Court
      reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s order by order of its own dated December 15,
      2006. The District Court permitted certain limited additional discovery, but
      concluded that on the record before it, there was no basis to set aside the
      attorney-client privilege.

Following
      the Trustee’s filing of a Form 8-K on behalf of 3dfx, in which the Trustee
      disclosed the terms of the proposed settlement agreement between NVIDIA and
      the
      Creditor’s Committee, certain shareholders of 3dfx filed a petition with the
      Bankruptcy Court to appoint an official committee to represent the claimed
      interests of 3dfx shareholders. That petition was granted and an Equity Holders
      Committee was appointed. Since that appointment, the Equity Holders Committee
      has filed a competing plan of reorganization/liquidation. The Equity Holders
      plan assumes that 3dfx can raise additional equity capital that would be used
      to
      retire all of 3dfx’s debts. Upon the payment of that debt, the Equity Holders
      Committee contends that NVIDIA would be obliged to pay the stock consideration
      provided for in the asset purchase agreement. By virtue of stock splits since
      the execution of the asset purchase agreement, the stock consideration would
      now
      total four million shares of our common stock. The Equity Holders’ Committee
      filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court for an order giving it standing to
      bring that lawsuit to enforce the Asset Purchase Agreement. Over our objection,
      the Bankruptcy Court granted that motion on May 1, 2006 and the Equity Holders’
Committee filed its Complaint for Declaratory Relief against NVIDIA that same
      day. NVIDIA moved to dismiss the Complaint for Declaratory Relief, and the
      Bankruptcy court granted that motion with leave to amend. The Equity Committee
      thereafter amended its complaint, and NVIDIA moved to dismiss that amended
      complaint as well. At the hearing on December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court
      granted the motion as to one of the Equity Holders’ Committee’s claims, and
      denied it as to the others. However, the Bankruptcy Court also ruled that NVIDIA
      would only be required to answer the first three causes of action by which
      the
      Equity Holders’ Committee seeks a determination that the Asset Purchase
      Agreement was not terminated before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy protection, that
      the 3dfx bankruptcy estate still holds some rights in the Asset Purchase
      Agreement, and that the agreement is capable of being assumed by the bankruptcy
      estate. In addition, the Equity Holders Committee filed a motion seeking
      Bankruptcy court approval of investor protections for Harbinger Capital Partners
      Master Fund I, Ltd., an equity investment firm that has conditionally agreed
      to
      pay no more than $51.5 million for preferred stock in 3dfx. The hearing on
      that
      motion was held on January 18, 2007, and the court approved the proposed
      protections. Beginning on March 21, 2007, NVIDIA and the Trustee are scheduled
      to try the question of the value of the assets 3dfx conveyed to NVIDIA and,
      in
      particular, whether the price NVIDIA paid for those assets was reasonably
      equivalent to the value of the assets 3dfx sold to NVIDIA.

Lawsuits
      related to our historical stock option granting practices and SEC
      inquiry

In
        June
        2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of NVIDIA, or the Audit Committee,
        began
        a review of our stock option practices based on the results of an internal
        review voluntarily undertaken by management. The Audit Committee, with the
        assistance of outside legal counsel, completed its review on November 13,
        when the Audit Committee reported its findings to our full Board. The review
        covered option grants to all employees, directors and consultants for all
        grant
        dates during the period from our initial public offering in January 1999
        through
        June 2006. Based on the findings of the Audit Committee and our internal
        review,
        we identified a number of occasions on which we used an incorrect measurement
        date for financial accounting and reporting purposes.

We
        voluntarily contacted the SEC regarding the Audit Committee’s review and, as of
        the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, the SEC is continuing the inquiry
        of
        our historical stock option grant practices it began in late August 2006.
        In
        October 2006, we met with the SEC and provided it with a review of the status
        of
        the Audit Committee’s review and in November 2006 we voluntarily provided the
        SEC with further documents. We continue to cooperate with the SEC in its
        inquiry.

Concurrently
        with our internal review and the SEC’s inquiry, since September 29, 2006, ten
        derivative cases have been filed in state and federal courts asserting claims
        concerning errors related to our historical stock option granting practices
        and
        associated accounting for stock-based compensation expense. These complaints
        have been filed in various courts, including the California Superior Court,
        Santa Clara County, the United States District Court for the Northern District
        of California, and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and
        for New
        Castle County.

Plaintiffs
        filed a consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the
        Northern District of California on February 28, 2007.

The
        California Superior Court cases

have
        been
        consolidated and plaintiffs are scheduled to file a consolidated complaint
        on or
        before March 22, 2007. All of the

cases
        purport to be brought derivatively on behalf of NVIDIA against members of
        our
        Board and several of our current and former officers and directors.

All

allege
        in substantially similar fashion claims for, among other things, breach of
        fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider selling, abuse of control, gross
        mismanagement, waste, constructive fraud, and violations of Sections 10(b)
        and
        14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. The
        plaintiffs seek to recover for NVIDIA, among other things, damages in an
        unspecified amount, rescission, punitive damages, treble damages for insider
        selling, and fees and costs. Plaintiffs also seek an accounting, a constructive
        trust and other equitable relief.

We
        intend
        to take all appropriate action in response to these
        complaints.

Opti

On
      October 19, 2004 Opti filed a complaint for patent infringement against NVIDIA
      in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. In its
      complaint, Opti asserted that unspecified NVIDIA chipsets infringe five United
      States patents held by Opti. Opti sought unspecified damages for our alleged
      conduct, attorneys’ fees and triple damages for alleged willful infringement by
      NVIDIA. In April 2006, the District Court issued a Markman ruling adopting
      Opti's proposed construction on 13 of the 15 terms at issue and Opti dropped
      from the lawsuit two of the five United States patents that Opti alleged NVIDIA
      infringes, and elected to pursue the three remaining patents at trial.

In
      August
      2006, Opti and NVIDIA settled this litigation. Under that settlement, NVIDIA
      was
      obligated to pay to Opti $11.0 million dollars for past and present licenses
      to
      the patents in suit and NVIDIA agreed to make additional quarterly payments
      to
      Opti should NVIDIA use certain patented technology after January 31, 2007.
      The
      case has now been dismissed with prejudice. The agreements with Opti call for
      us
      to pay $11.0 million in exchange for Opti’s dismissal of its lawsuit against us
      and for certain patent license rights. Of this $11.0 million, we recorded $8.0
      million as a patent-related intangible asset and $3.0 million as a charge to
      cost of revenue.

Department
      of Justice Subpoena and Investigation

On
      November 29, 2006, we received a subpoena from the San Francisco Office of
      the
      Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, in
      connection with the DOJ's investigation into potential antitrust violations
      related to graphics processing units and cards. No specific allegations have
      been made against us. We plan to cooperate with the DOJ in its investigation.
      As
      of March 14, 2007, 42 civil complaints have been filed against us. The
      majority are pending in the Northern District of California, a number are
      pending in the Central District of California, and other cases are pending
      in
      several other Federal district courts. Although the complaints differ, they
      generally purport to assert federal and state antitrust claims based on alleged
      price fixing, market allocation, and other alleged anti-competitive agreements
      between us and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, as a result of its
      acquisition of ATI Technologies, Inc., or ATI. Many of the cases also assert
      a
      variety of state law unfair competition or consumer protection claims on the
      same allegations and some cases assert unjust enrichment or other common law
      claims. The complaints are putative class actions alleging classes of direct
      and/or indirect purchasers of our graphic processing units and cards. The
      plaintiffs in a few of the Northern District of California actions have filed
      a
      motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation asking that all
      pending and subsequent cases be consolidated in one court for all pre-trial
      discovery and motion practice. A hearing on this motion is set for March 29,
      2007. We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend
      to vigorously defend the cases.

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Continued)

Income
      tax expense as a
      percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 9.4%
      in
      fiscal 2007, 15.6% in fiscal 2006, and 17.2% in fiscal 2005. The difference
      in
      the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily a result of
      changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax, with the additional
      change in mix in fiscal 2007 due to certain stock-based compensation expensed
      for financial accounting purposes under SFAS No. 123(R), and an increase in
      the amount of research tax credit benefit in fiscal 2007.

As
      of
      January 28, 2007, we had a valuation allowance of $68.6 million. Of
      the total valuation allowance, $3.7 million relates to state tax attributes
      acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred
      tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to potential
      utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes, and
      $64.9 million relates to state deferred tax assets that management
      determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future
      taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related
      to
      certain acquisitions becomes probable, recognition of these acquired tax
      benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero, then reduce other non-current
      intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit
      reported as a reduction to income tax expense. To the extent realization of
      the
      deferred tax assets related to state tax benefits becomes probable, we would
      recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than
      not
      to be realized.

As
      of
      January 28, 2007, with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we have
      derecognized both deferred tax assets for the excess of tax benefit related
      to
      stock-based compensation, reflected in our federal and state net operating
      loss
      and research tax credit carryforwards, and the offsetting valuation allowance.
      Consistent with prior years, the excess tax benefit reflected in our net
      operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, in the amount of $344.9
      million as of January 28, 2007, will be accounted for as a credit to
      stockholders’ equity, if and when realized. In determining if and when excess
      tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to do so on a
“with-and-without” approach with respect to such excess tax benefits. We have
      also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation
      deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes, and specifically
      to
      recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing
      operations.

As
      of
      January 28 2007, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of
      approximately $770.5 million and cumulative state net operating loss
      carryforwards of approximately $584.1 million. The federal net operating loss
      carryforward will expire beginning in fiscal 2012 and the state net operating
      loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2008 according to the rules
      of
      each particular state. As of January 28, 2007 we had federal research tax
      credit carryforwards of approximately $129.0 million that will begin to expire
      in fiscal 2008. We have other federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately
      $1.2 million that will begin to expire in fiscal 2011. The research tax credit
      carryforwards attributable to states is approximately $125.6 million, of which
      approximately $121.3 million is attributable to the State of California and
      may
      be carried over indefinitely, and approximately $4.3 million is attributable
      to
      various other states and will expire beginning in fiscal 2016 according to
      the
      rules of each particular state. We have other California state tax credit
      carryforwards of approximately $4.8 million that will begin to expire in fiscal
      2009. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may
      be
      subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided
      by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. If such a limitation
      applies, the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may expire before
      full utilization.

As
      of
      January 28, 2007, United States federal and state income taxes have
      not been provided on approximately $304.0 million of undistributed earnings
      of
      non-United States subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be
      permanently reinvested.

Note
      14 - Segment Information

Our
      Chief
      Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker,
      or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis
      for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
      During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we reorganized our operating segments
      to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to position
      ourselves as the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor
      technologies. We report financial information for four product-line operating
      segments to our CODM: the GPU Business is composed of products that support
      desktop PCs, notebook PCs, professional workstations and

other
      GPU-based products

;
      the MCP
      Business is composed of NVIDIA nForce products that operate as a single-chip
      or
      chipset that provide system functions, such as high speed processing and network
      communications, and perform these operations independently from the host CPU;
      our Handheld GPU Business is composed of products that support handheld PDAs,
      cellular phones and other handheld devices; and our Consumer Electronics
      Business is concentrated in products that support video game consoles and other
      digital consumer electronics devices and is composed of revenue from our
      contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCE’s
      PlayStation3, revenue from sales of our Xbox-related products, revenue from
      our license agreement with Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft, relating to
      the
      successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the Xbox360, and related
      devices, and digital media processor products. In addition to these operating
      segments, we have the “All Other” category that includes human resources, legal,
      finance, general administration and corporate marketing expenses, which total
      $242.3 million, $131.6 million and $118.0 million for fiscal years 2007, 2006
      and 2005, respectively, that we do not allocate to our other operating segments.
      “All Other” also includes the results of operations of other miscellaneous
      operating segments that are neither individually reportable, nor aggregated
      with
      another operating segment. Revenue in the “All Other” category is primarily
      derived from sales of memory.  Certain prior period amounts have been
      restated to conform to the presentation of our current fiscal
      quarter.

(Continued)

Our
      CODM
      does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment
      basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly,
      there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting
      are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.
