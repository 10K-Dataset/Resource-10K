Business

OVERVIEW

Lincoln
      National Corporation (“LNC” which also may be referred to as “we” or “our” or
“us”) is a holding company, which operates multiple insurance and investment
      management businesses through subsidiary companies. LNC was organized under
      the
      laws of the state of Indiana in 1968, and maintains its principal executive
      offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “Lincoln Financial Group” is the
      marketing name for LNC and its subsidiary companies. At December 31, 2005,
      LNC
      had consolidated assets of $124.8 billion and consolidated shareholders’ equity
      of $6.4 billion.

Through
      our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection and
      accumulation products. These products include fixed annuities, variable
      annuities, universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, term
      life insurance, other individual insurance coverages, retail mutual funds,
“529”
college savings plans and managed accounts. We have four business segments:
      1)
      Lincoln Retirement, 2) Life Insurance, 3) Investment Management and 4) Lincoln
      UK. We also have an “Other Operations” category that includes the financial data
      for the operations of Lincoln Financial Advisors (“LFA”) and Lincoln Financial
      Distributors (“LFD”), our retail and wholesale distributors, and for operations
      that are not directly related to the business segments, unallocated corporate
      items (such as corporate investment income, interest expense on short-term
      and
      long-term borrowings and other expenses), and the historical results of the
      former Reinsurance segment, which was sold to Swiss Re in the fourth quarter
      of
      2001, along with the ongoing amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity
      reinsurance portion of the transaction with Swiss Re.

Financial
      information in the tables that follow is presented in conformity with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless
      otherwise indicated. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’
financial information to conform to the 2005 presentation. We provide revenues,
      income (loss) from operations and assets attributable to each of our business
      segments and Other Operations as well as revenues derived inside and outside
      the
      U.S. for the last three fiscal years in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
      Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.


Our
      revenues by segment for each of the last three fiscal years were as follows:

Acquisitions
      and Divestitures

On
      October 9, 2005, we entered into a merger agreement with Jefferson-Pilot
      Corporation ("Jefferson-Pilot"), as amended on January 26, 2006, pursuant to
      which Jefferson-Pilot will merge into one of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
      Jefferson-Pilot, through its subsidiaries, offers full lines of individual
      life,
      annuity and investment products, and group life insurance products, disability
      income and dental policies, and it operates television and radio stations.

Under
      the
      terms of the merger agreement, as amended, Jefferson-Pilot shareholders may
      choose to receive (i) 1.0906 shares of LNC common stock for each of their
      shares, (ii) $55.96 in cash for each of their shares or (iii) a combination
      of
      LNC common stock and cash. Notwithstanding the election, the aggregate amount
      of
      the cash payment to Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will equal $1.8 billion.
      Accordingly, the election of Jefferson-Pilot shareholders may be subject to
      a
      pro-rata adjustment. LNC plans to utilize the existing bridge facility (see
      below ) to finance the cash portion of the purchase price at closing and to
      permanently finance the cash portion of the purchase price as soon as
      practicable after closing through a combination of senior and subordinated
      long-term debt or other securities. The transaction, which is subject to the
      approval of shareholders of both companies, regulatory approvals and customary
      closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2006. For
      more
      information regarding this transaction, see Amendment No. 1 to our Form S-4
      (Registration No. 333-130226) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
      ("SEC") on February 9, 2006.

In
      October 2005, a purported shareholder class action suit for damages was filed
      in
      state court in North Carolina naming Jefferson-Pilot, most of the individual
      members of its board of directors and LNC as defendants. The complaint alleged
      that certain defendants had breached their fiduciary duties by entering into
      the
      merger agreement. The complaint sought, among other things, unspecified
      compensatory damages. In January 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion to
      voluntarily withdraw the lawsuit, which the court granted without prejudice,
      subject to the restriction that the plaintiffs receive the court’s permission
      before filing any other actions asserting the same claims in North Carolina
      or
      any other jurisdiction. The voluntary dismissal of this action did not involve
      a
      settlement or any compensation being paid or promised to
      plaintiffs.

In
      December 2005, we entered into a bridge facility with a group of banks to
      provide for borrowings of up to $2.3 billion in connection with our merger
      with
      Jefferson-Pilot and planned share repurchase, and in February 2006, we entered
      into a Credit and Letter of Credit Facility with a group of banks to provide
      for
      borrowings and issuances of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of
      $1
      billion. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Liquidity and Cash
      Flow - Financing Activities" for additional information.

In
      September 2004, we completed the sale of our London-based international
      investment unit, Delaware International Advisors Ltd. (“DIAL”), to a
      newly-formed company associated with DIAL’s management and a private-equity
      firm. At closing, we received $180.9 million in cash and relief of certain
      obligations of approximately $19 million. We had an after-tax gain from the
      transaction of $46.1 million. DIAL, which has since been renamed Mondrian,
      continues to provide sub-advisory services with respect to certain international
      asset classes for our Investment Management segment and LNC.

For
      further information about acquisitions and divestitures, see “Acquisitions and
      Divestitures” in the MD&A and Notes 3 and 13 to our Consolidated Financial
      Statements.


Branding

Branding
      is a key element of our strategy. Our branding efforts are focused on two
      primary target audiences: financial intermediaries where we work to build brand
      familiarity and very affluent consumers (top 11% of the population) where we
      work to build name awareness.

In
      2005,
      we continued to build our brand on a national basis through an integrated
      package of consumer print and television, trade print and Internet advertising;
      sponsorships; and promotional events. As a result, we believe that our awareness
      among our financial intermediary and targeted-consumer audiences increased
      in
      2005.

BUSINESS
      SEGMENTS AND OTHER OPERATIONS

Lincoln
      Retirement

Overview

The
      Lincoln Retirement segment, with principal operations in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
      and Hartford, Connecticut, and additional operations in Portland, Maine, and
      Arlington Heights, Illinois, provides tax-deferred investment growth and
      lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering fixed and variable
      annuities, and other retirement products. There are two lines of business within
      this segment, individual markets and employer-sponsored markets. Capitalizing
      on
      a broad product portfolio and a strong and diverse distribution network, Lincoln
      Retirement is a leader in both the individual and employer-sponsored annuity
      markets. According to Variable Annuity Research and Data Services (“VARDS”), LNC
      ranked 6

th

in
      assets and 5

th

in
      individual variable annuity sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the
      United States.

The
      individual annuities line of business offers non-qualified and qualified fixed
      and variable annuities to individuals. Annuities are attractive because they
      provide tax-deferred growth in the underlying principal, thereby deferring
      the
      tax consequences of the growth in value until withdrawals are made from the
      accumulation values, often at lower tax rates occurring during retirement.
      In
      addition to favorable tax treatment, annuities are unique in that retirees
      can
      select a variety of payout alternatives to help provide an income flow for
      life.
      The individual annuities market has seen an increase in competition along with
      new product types and promotion. The guarantee features (living and death
      benefits) offered within an annuity are not found in any other investment
      vehicle, and we believe, make annuities attractive even in times of economic
      uncertainty.

The
      employer-sponsored line of business offers fixed and variable annuities along
      with a turnkey retirement program, the Alliance program, to targeted markets.
      The key market segments of the employer-sponsored business are: healthcare,
      public/governmental, education, corporate and not-for-profits. Within these
      segments, we target those markets that offer the most favorable demographics,
      distribution synergies and current and potential market share.

Products

In
      general, an annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual
      or group in which the insurance company, after receipt of one or more
      contributions, agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on
      a
      periodic basis (i.e., annually, semi-annually, quarterly or monthly), beginning
      on a certain date and continuing for a period of time as specified in the
      contract. Such payments can begin the month after the deposit is received
      (referred to as an immediate annuity) or at a future date in time (referred
      to
      as a deferred annuity). This retirement vehicle helps protect an individual
      from
      outliving his or her money and can be either a fixed annuity or a variable
      annuity.


The
      Lincoln Retirement segment’s deposits for the periods indicated were as follows:

Variable
      Annuities

A
      variable annuity provides the contractholder the ability to direct the
      investment of deposits into one or more sub-accounts offered through the product
      (“variable portion”) or into a fixed account with a guaranteed return (“fixed
      portion”). The value of the variable portion of the contractholder’s account
      varies with the performance of the underlying sub-accounts chosen by the
      contractholder. The underlying assets of the sub-accounts are managed within
      a
      special insurance series of funds, similar to mutual funds. The contractholder’s
      return is tied to the performance of the segregated assets underlying the
      variable annuity, i.e., the contractholder bears the investment risk associated
      with these investments, except for the impact of guaranteed benefit features.
      The value of the fixed portion is guaranteed by us and recorded in our general
      account liabilities. Account values of variable annuities were $57.2 billion,
      $50.1 billion and $43.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
      and
      2003, including the fixed portions of variable accounts of $9.6 billion, $9.7
      billion and $9.8 billion, respectively.

We
      charge
      mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover
      insurance and administrative charges. These assessments are built into
      accumulation unit values, which when multiplied by the number of units owned
      for
      any sub-account equals the contractholder’s account value for that sub-account.
      Some products feature decreasing fee schedules based on account value break
      points. The fees that we earn from these policies are reported as insurance
      fees
      on the income statement. In addition, for some contracts, we collect surrender
      charges that range from 0% to 10% of withdrawals—generally higher during the
      early years of a contract—when contractholders surrender their contracts during
      the surrender charge period of their contract. Our individual variable annuity
      products have a maximum surrender charge period of ten years.

We
      offer
      A-share, B-share, C-share, L-share and bonus variable annuities. The differences
      in A, B, C, L and bonus shares relate to the sales charge and fee structure
      associated with the contract.


•

An
                L-share has a four to five year contingent deferred sales charge
                that is
                only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess
                of
                contractual free withdrawals within the contract’s specified surrender
                charge period. The differences between the L-share and B-share are
                the
                length of the surrender charge period and the fee structure. L-shares
                have
                a shorter surrender charge period, so for the added liquidity, mortality
                and expense assessments are higher. It offers a persistency credit
                in year
                seven to revert pricing to B share levels.

•

A
                bonus annuity is a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus
                credit to
                a contract based on a specified percentage (typically ranging from
                2% to
                5%) of each deposit. The entire premium plus the bonus are invested
                in the
                sub-accounts supporting the contract. It has a seven to nine-year
                contingent deferred sales charge. The expenses are slightly more
                than
                those for a B-share. We also offer bonus annuity products with persistency
                credits beginning in years eight or fifteen to revert bonus pricing
                back
                to B-share pricing levels.

      variable annuity products are offered to both individuals and the
      employer-sponsored market under a variety of names: American Legacy

      and

      Certain
      of our variable annuity products offer features, such as a guaranteed minimum
      death benefit (“GMDB”), a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) and a
      combination of such benefits. Most of our variable annuity products also offer
      the choice of a fixed option that provides for guaranteed interest credited
      to
      the account value.

The
      separate account choices for our variable annuities cover diverse asset classes
      with varying levels of risk and include both equity funds and fixed income
      funds. The Multi-Fund

Variable
      Annuity product line offers up to approximately 34 fund choices from
      11 well-known advisors, including American Funds Insurance Series

      American Legacy Variable Annuity, a premier single manager individual and group
      variable annuity product line, offers 13 mutual fund choices from American

SM

.
      American Legacy Variable Annuity accounted for 42%, 38% and 25% of variable
      annuity deposits in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, the American
      Legacy Variable Annuity product line represented approximately 49%, 47% and
      46%
      of our total variable annuity account values at December 31, 2005, 2004 and
      2003, respectively.

As
      stated
      above, certain of our variable annuities offer a GMDB feature. Approximately
      95%
      of variable annuity separate account values had a GMDB feature at December
      31,
      2005, 2004 and 2003. The GMDB features include those where we contractually
      guarantee to the contract holder either (

a

)
      return
      of no less than total deposits made to the contract less any partial
      withdrawals, (

b

)
      total
      deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum
      return, or (

c

)
      the
      highest contract value on a specified anniversary date minus any partial
      withdrawals following the contract anniversary.

The

Lincoln
      Smart Security

SM

Advantage benefit is a GMWB feature that offers the contractholder a guarantee
      equal to the initial deposit (or contract value, if elected after issue),
      adjusted for any subsequent purchase payments or withdrawals.

There
      are
      two elective step-up options: a one-year and a five-year option. The one-year
      option allows an owner to step up the guarantee automatically (if the contract
      value is greater than the initial deposit) on the benefit anniversary for 10
      years, with an optional election of an additional 10-year step-up period if
      the
      owner is age eligible. The five-year option allows the owner to step-up the
      guarantee amount on or after the fifth anniversary of the election or of the
      most recent step up (if the contract value is greater than the initial
      deposit)

.

To
      receive the full amount of the guarantee, annual withdrawals are limited to
      either 5% of the guaranteed amount for the one-year step-up or 7% of the
      guaranteed amount for the five-year step-up. Withdrawals in excess of the
      applicable maximum in any contract year are assessed any applicable surrender
      charges, and the guaranteed amount is recalculated. The charge for this benefit
      with the one-year step-up is 0.65% annually of the guaranteed amount (less
      withdrawals) and 0.45% annually of the guaranteed amount (less withdrawals)
      for
      the five-year step-up, both assessed on a quarterly basis. The charge may be
      waived under certain circumstances. The benefit may also be cancelled at any
      time five years after election or owner-elected step-up of the guaranteed
      amount. If cancelled, the benefit may be re-elected after one year if the
      benefit is still offered. The

Lincoln
      Smart Security

SM

Advantage is available on new and existing variable annuity contracts for most
      of our individual variable annuity products. Approximately 15%, 8% and 2% of
      variable annuity account values at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
      had elected a GMWB feature.

To
      mitigate the increased risks associated with GMDBs and GMWBs, we developed
      a
      dynamic hedging program. The customized dynamic hedging program uses equity
      and
      interest rate futures positions as well as equity-based options depending upon
      the risks underlying the guarantees. Our program is designed to offset both
      positive and negative changes in the carrying value of the guarantees. However,
      while we actively manage these hedge positions, the hedge positions may not
      be
      effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees
      due to, among other things, the time lag between changes in their values and
      corresponding changes in the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity
      markets,


contractholder
      behavior, and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and
      hedging indices. For more information on our hedging program, see “Critical
      Accounting Policies—Insurance and Investment Contract Obligations” of the
      MD&A. For information regarding risks related to GMDBs and GMWBs, see “Risk
      Factors” below.

We
      offer
      other product riders including the

Income4Life

®

Solution
      and

i4LIFE

®

Advantage. There is an annual charge of 0.40% on account value for this feature.
      The

Income4Life

and

i4LIFE

®

features, on which we have received a U.S. patent, allow variable annuity
      contractholders access and control during the income distribution phase of
      their
      contract. This added flexibility allows the contractholder to access the account
      value for transfers, additional withdrawals and other service features like
      portfolio rebalancing. In September 2003, the Guaranteed Income Benefit (GIB)
      feature was added to

i4LIFE

®

Advantage. The GIB is an optional feature that guarantees regular income
      payments will not fall below 75% of the initial income payment. The annual
      charge for the optional GIB feature is 0.50% of the account value. The GIB
      may
      be terminated on an

i4LIFE

®

Advantage contract and regular income payment will no longer be subject to
      this
      minimum income payment guarantee. Approximately 80% of

i4LIFE

®

Advantage contracts elected the GIB feature in 2005, and approximately 70%
      elected it in 2004. During 2005, a return of premium death benefit option was
      added to

i4LIFE

®

Advantage to better align the death benefits available with the underlying
      product chassis. Approximately 3%, 1% and less than 1% of variable annuity
      account values at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, have elected
      an

i4LIFE

®

feature.

Fixed
      Annuities

A
      fixed
      annuity preserves the principal value of the contract while guaranteeing a
      minimum interest rate to be credited to the accumulation value. We offer both
      single and flexible premium fixed deferred annuities to the individual annuities
      market. Single premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow only
      a
      single contribution to be made. Flexible premium fixed deferred annuities are
      contracts that allow multiple contributions on either a scheduled or
      non-scheduled basis. With fixed deferred annuities, the contractholder has
      the
      right to surrender the contract and receive the current accumulation value
      less
      any applicable surrender charge and, if applicable, a market value adjustment
      (MVA). Also, certain fixed annuity products allow for a window period between
      the end of the fixed guarantee period and the start of the subsequent guarantee
      period during which the contractholder can withdraw their funds without
      incurring a surrender charge.

Fixed
      annuity contributions are invested in our general account. We bear the
      investment risk for fixed annuity contracts. To protect from premature
      withdrawals, we impose surrender charges. Surrender charges are typically
      applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, with a declining
      level of surrender charge over time. We expect to earn a spread between what
      we
      earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity
      product line and what we credit to our fixed annuity contractholders’ accounts.
      Fixed annuity account values were $11.5 billion, $11.8 billion and $11.4 billion
      at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Approximately $5.5 billion, $5.7 billion
      and $5.6 billion of fixed annuity account values at December 31, 2005, 2004
      and
      2003, respectively, were still within the surrender charge period.

Our
      fixed
      annuity product offerings as of December 31, 2005 include the Lincoln Select
      and
      ChoicePlus Fixed Annuities, StepThree

®

and
      ChoiceGuarantee

®

Fixed
      Annuities. These products allow an individual to select a specific guaranteed
      period typically ranging from one to ten years. If the contract stays in force
      for the entire guarantee period, then the contract will earn the specified
      rate
      of interest for the full period. If a Lincoln Select or ChoicePlus Fixed Annuity
      contract is surrendered during the guarantee period, both a surrender charge
      and
      an MVA may be applied. The MVA feature increases or decreases the contract
      value
      of the annuity based on a decrease or increase in interest rates. The increase
      and decrease on the contract value is generally offset by increases and
      decreases in the value of the underlying assets. However, in a rising interest
      rate environment the contractholder’s contract value cannot drop below the
      non-forfeiture value subjecting us to interest rate risk. Fixed annuities with
      an MVA feature constituted 25%, 21% and 19% of total fixed annuity account
      values at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Alliance
      Program

Our
      Alliance program, which is offered in the employer-sponsored market, bundles
      our
      traditional fixed annuity products with the employer’s choice of retail mutual
      funds, along with recordkeeping and employee education components. We earn
      fees
      for the services we provide to mutual fund accounts and investment margins
      on
      fixed annuities of Alliance program accounts. The retail mutual funds associated
      with the Alliance program are not included in the separate accounts reported
      on
      our Consolidated Balance Sheet. This program is customized for each employer.
      Alliance program deposits represented 15%, 14% and 16% of the segment’s deposits
      in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


Distribution

The
      Lincoln Retirement segment distributes all its individual fixed and variable
      annuity products through LFD, our wholesaling distribution organization. LFD’s
      distribution channels give the Lincoln Retirement segment access to its target
      markets. LFD distributes the Lincoln Retirement segment’s products to a large
      number of financial intermediaries, including LFA. The financial intermediaries
      include wire/regional firms, independent financial planners, financial
      institutions, managing general agents and corporate specialty markets.

The
      Employer Retirement Markets Division, a part of LFA, offers our
      MultiFund

®

Variable
      Annuity product line in both the individual and employer-sponsored annuities
      markets and the Alliance Program in the employer-sponsored annuities market.

Competition

The
      annuities market is very competitive and consists of many companies, with no
      one
      company dominating the market for all products. The Lincoln Retirement segment
      competes with numerous other financial services companies. The main factors
      upon
      which entities in this market compete are wholesaling, investment performance,
      cost, product features, speed to market, brand recognition, financial strength
      ratings, distribution channel access, crediting rates and client service.

Lincoln
      Retirement believes that its high service levels help it to compete in the
      annuities market. Lincoln Retirement has a call center staffed with more than
      100 representatives. It tracks the amount of time in which calls to the center
      are answered as well as the average response time to customer queries. Further,
      Lincoln Retirement tracks the turnaround time for various customer services
      such
      as processing of applications.

The
      Lincoln Retirement segment attempts to design products that meet the needs
      of
      clients in its markets. The speed in which Lincoln Retirement’s products reach
      the market is a competitive advantage. Generally, from concept of the product
      to
      launch, it takes us six to nine months. Over the last five years, the Lincoln
      Retirement segment has announced several new products and product features
      to
      market in response to the evolving nature of the annuities market.


Life
      Insurance

Overview

The
      Life
      Insurance segment, with principal operations in Hartford, Connecticut and
      additional operations in Fort Wayne, Indiana and Schaumburg, Illinois, focuses
      on the creation and protection of wealth for its clients through the
      manufacturing of life insurance products. The Life Insurance segment offers
      both
      single and survivorship versions of universal life (“UL”), variable universal
      life (“VUL”), interest-sensitive whole life (“ISWL”), corporate owned universal
      and variable universal life insurance (“COLI”) and term insurance. The segment
      also offers a linked-benefit product, MoneyGuard

®

,
      which
      is a universal life insurance policy linked with riders that provide
      reimbursement for long-term care costs.

The
      life
      insurance operation primarily targets the affluent market, defined as households
      with at least $1,000,000 of investable net worth.

For
      those
      policies we sold in 2005,

the
      average face amount (excluding term, COLI cases covering 200 or more lives,
      and
      MoneyGuard

®

)
      was
      $1.4 million and average first year premiums paid were approximately $35,000.

Products

The
      Life
      Insurance segment sells interest/market-sensitive products (UL, VUL, ISWL,
      COLI)
      and term products. The Life Insurance segment’s first-year premiums (excluding
      internal replacement premiums) for the prior three years were as follows:

Due
      to
      some seasonality in Retail sales, we generally see more sales in the second
      half
      of the year than in the first half of the year. Approximately 45%, 48% and
      43%
      of total Retail sales were in the first half of 2005, 2004, and 2003, with
      the
      remainder occurring in the second half of the year for the same periods.

In
      addition, the following table shows life policies’ face amount in-force.

Mortality
      margins, investment margins (through spreads or fees), net expense charges
      (expense charges assessed to the policyholder less expenses incurred to manage
      the business) and surrender fees drive life insurance profits. Mortality margins
      represent the difference between amounts charged to the customer to cover the
      mortality risk and the actual cost of reinsurance and death benefits paid.
      Mortality charges are either specifically deducted from the contract holder’s
      policy account value (i.e., cost of insurance assessments or “COI’s”) or are
      embedded in the premiums charged to the customer. In either case, these amounts
      are a function of the rates priced into the product and level of insurance
      in-force (less reserves previously set aside to fund benefits). Insurance
      in-force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.

Similar
      to the annuity product classifications described above, life products can be
      classified as “fixed” or “variable” contracts. This classification describes
      whether the policyholder or we bear the investment risk of the assets supporting
      the policy. This also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin
      profits from these products, either as investment spreads for fixed products
      or
      as asset-based fees charged to variable products.


We
      offer
      four categories of life insurance products consisting of:

Fixed
      Life Insurance (primarily UL, including MoneyGuard

®

and
      ISWL (excluding COLI)):

Fixed
      life insurance products provide life insurance with account (cash) values that
      earn rates of return based on company-declared interest rates. Policyholder
      account values are invested in our general account investment portfolio, so
      we
      bear the risk of investment performance. Some of our UL contracts include
      secondary guarantees; which are explained more fully later in the
      document.

In
      a UL
      contract, policyholders have flexibility in the timing and amount of premium
      payments and the amount of death benefit, provided there is sufficient account
      value to cover all policy charges for mortality and expenses for the coming
      period. Under certain policyholder options and market conditions, the death
      benefit amount may increase or decrease. Premiums received on a UL product,
      net
      of expense loads and charges, are added to the policyholder’s account value. The
      client has access to their account value (or a portion thereof) through
      contractual liquidity features such as loans, partial withdrawals and full
      surrenders. Loans and withdrawals reduce the death benefit amount, are limited
      to certain contractual maximums (some of which are required under state law)
      and
      interest is charged on all loans. Our UL contracts assess surrender charges
      against the policies’ account values for full or partial face amount surrenders
      that occur during the contractual surrender charge period. Depending on the
      product selected, surrender charge periods can range from 10 to 20 years.

ISWL
      contracts have fixed premiums and guaranteed minimum cash values. Excess
      interest, mortality and expense credits are credited to policyholders based
      upon
      current expectations as to mortality experience, earned interest rates and
      expense factors. These credits are declared at the beginning of the calendar
      year and are paid at the end of the policy year. Credits are used to purchase
      units of paid-up insurance, purchase term insurance or reduce premium outlay.
      Policy loans are available at a variable interest rate.

We
      manage
      investment margins (i.e., the difference between the rate the portfolio earns
      compared to the rate that is credited to the customer) by seeking to maximize
      current yields, in line with asset/liability and risk management targets, while
      crediting a competitive rate to the customer. Crediting rates are typically
      subject to guaranteed minimums specified in the underlying life insurance
      contract. Fixed life account values (excluding VUL and COLI) were $11.6 billion,
      $11.0 billion and $10.5 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively.

Variable
      Universal Life Insurance (VUL) (excluding COLI):

VUL
      products are UL products that provide a return on account values linked to
      an
      underlying investment portfolio of sub-accounts offered through the product.
      The
      value of the policyholder’s account varies with the performance of the
      sub-accounts chosen by the policyholder. The underlying assets of the
      sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance series of funds. Premiums,
      net of expense loads and charges for mortality and expenses, received on VUL
      products are invested in the policyholder’s investment option selection. As the
      return on the investment portfolio increases or decreases, the account value
      of
      the variable universal life policy will increase or decrease. As with fixed
      UL
      products, policyholders have access, within contractual maximums, to account
      values through loans, withdrawals and surrenders. Surrender charges are assessed
      during the surrender charge period (generally ranging from 15 to 20 years
      depending on the product). The investment choices we offer in VUL products
      are
      the same, in most cases, as the investment choices offered in our individual
      variable annuity contracts.

In
      addition, VUL products offer a fixed account option that is managed by LNC.
      Investment risk is borne by the customer on all but the fixed account option.
      We
      charge fees for mortality costs and administrative expenses, as well as asset
      based investment management fees. VUL account values (excluding COLI) were
      $2.5
      billion, $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively.

Term
      Life Insurance:

Term
      life insurance provides a fixed death benefit for a scheduled period of time.
      It
      usually does not offer cash values. Scheduled policy premiums are required
      to be
      paid annually (on a monthly or annual basis). A Return of Premium term product,
      Lincoln Pro, has been offered since March 2005.

Corporate
      Owned Life Insurance (COLI):

COLI
      is
      typically purchased by corporations on the lives of its employees, with the
      corporation or a trust sponsored by the corporation named as a beneficiary
      under
      the policy, for the purpose of funding non-qualified deferred compensation
      plans. LNC offers a portfolio of both fixed UL and VUL COLI products sold
      primarily through specialty brokers. COLI account values were $1.3 billion,
      $1.1
      billion and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

As
      mentioned previously, we offer survivorship versions of our non-COLI UL, VUL
      and
      ISWL products. These products insure two lives with a single policy and pay
      death benefits upon the second death.


The
      Life
      Insurance segment has continued to develop products that meet the changing
      needs
      of its target affluent market. Sales results continue to be heavily influenced
      by the series of universal life products with the Lapse Protection Rider
      (“LPR”), originally introduced in 1998. The LPR is a secondary guarantee that
      promises to keep a policy in force, even if the base policy account value is
      zero, as long as the No Lapse Value (“NLV”) of the policy remains positive. The
      NLV is a reference value, calculated in a manner similar to the base policy
      account value, but using different assumptions as to expense charges, COI
      charges, and credited interest. The assumptions for the NLV calculation are
      listed in the contract. As long as the policyholder funds the policy to a level
      that keeps this calculated NLV positive, the death benefit will be guaranteed.
      The NLV has no actual monetary value to the policyholder; it is only a
      calculated value used to determine whether or not the policy will lapse should
      the base policy account value be less than zero.

Unlike
      other guaranteed death benefit designs, the LPR maintains the flexibility of
      a
      traditional UL policy, which allows a policyholder to take loans or withdrawals.
      Although loans and withdrawals are likely to shorten the time period of the
      guaranteed death benefit, the guarantee is not automatically or completely
      forfeited, as is sometimes the case with other death benefit guarantee designs.
      The length of the guarantee may be increased at any time through additional
      excess premium deposits.

During
      2005, we continued to monitor the regulatory changes that impact reserving
      for
      these products as well as the competitive environment. LPR face amount in-force
      was $30.9 billion, $25.0 billion and $20.2 billion as of December 31, 2005,
      and 2003.

In
      May
      2005, an updated version of our innovative single life Lincoln VUL

ONE

product
      was released. Originally developed in May 2004, VUL

ONE

combines
      the lapse protection of universal life with the upside potential of a
      traditional variable universal life product. VUL

ONE

gives
      clients the flexibility to choose the appropriate balance between protection
      and
      market risk that meets their individual needs. VUL

ONE

face
      amount in-force was $1.8 billion and $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2005 and
      2004, respectively.

Distribution

The
      Life
      Insurance segment’s products are sold through LFD. LFD provides the Life
      Insurance segment with access to financial intermediaries in the following
      primary distribution channels—wire/regional firms, independent planner firms,
      including LFA, financial institutions, managing general agents and corporate
      specialty markets.

Competition

The
      life
      insurance industry is very competitive and consists of many companies with
      no
      one company dominating the market for all products. At the end of 2004, the
      latest year for which data is available, there were approximately 1,179 life
      insurance companies in the United States.

The
      Life
      Insurance segment designs products specifically for the high net-worth and
      affluent markets. In addition to the growth opportunity offered by its target
      market, our product breadth, design innovation, competitiveness, speed to
      market, customer service and extensive distribution network all contribute
      to
      the strength of the Life Insurance segment. On average, the development of
      products takes approximately six months. The Life Insurance segment announced
      several major product upgrades and/or new features, including important VUL,
      MoneyGuard

®

,
      Term
      and COLI product enhancements and new riders in 2005. With respect to customer
      service, the Life Insurance segment has a service center staffed with
      approximately 150 employees. Management tracks the speed, accuracy and
      responsiveness of service to customers’ calls and transaction requests. Further,
      the Life Insurance segment tracks the turnaround time and quality for various
      client services such as processing of applications.

Underwriting

In
      the
      context of life insurance, underwriting is the process of evaluating medical
      and
      non-medical information about an individual and determining the effect these
      factors statistically have on life expectancy or mortality. This process of
      evaluation is often referred to as risk classification. Of course, no one can
      accurately predict how long any individual will live, but certain risk factors
      can affect life expectancy and are evaluated during the underwriting process.


Claims
      Administration

Claims
      services are delivered to customers from the Hartford, Connecticut home office.
      Claims examiners are assigned to each claim notification based on coverage
      amount, type of claim and the experience of the examiner. Claims meeting certain
      criteria are referred to senior claim examiners. A formal quality assurance
      program is carried out to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of claims
      examining activities. A network of in-house legal counsel, compliance officers,
      medical personnel and an anti-fraud investigative unit also support claim
      examiners. A special claims unit has also been established in the Hartford,
      Connecticut claims department to focus on more complex specialized matters
      such
      as MoneyGuard

®

long-term
      care claims, claims incurred during the contestable period, beneficiary
      disputes, litigated claims, and to effectively deal with the few invalid claims
      that are encountered.

The
      Life
      Insurance segment maintains a centralized claim service center in order to
      minimize the volume of clerical and repetitive administrative demands on its
      claims examiners, while providing convenient service to policy owners and
      beneficiaries. A centralized call center is also located in the claim service
      center to provide for consistent, timely and comprehensive responses to customer
      requests and inquiries.

Investment
      Management

Overview

The
      Investment Management segment, with principal operations in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania, provides investment products and services to both individual
      and
      institutional investors through Delaware Management Holdings, Inc. and its
      affiliates, also referred to as “Delaware.” Delaware offers a broad line of
      mutual funds, retirement plan services and other investment products, including
      managed accounts and “529” college savings plans for Hawaii and Pennsylvania, to
      retail investors.

Delaware
      also offers investment advisory services and products to institutional clients,
      such as corporate and public retirement plans, endowments and foundations,
      nuclear decommissioning trusts, sub-advisory clients and Taft-Hartley plans,
      and
      may include mutual funds offered by non-Delaware entities for which Delaware
      acts as a sub-advisor. At December 31, 2005, Delaware serves as investment
      advisor to approximately 270 institutional accounts, acts as investment manager
      and performs additional services for approximately 100 open-end funds and for
      closed-end funds. The Investment Management segment also provides investment
      advisory services for our corporate and general insurance portfolios, including
      separate accounts and mutual funds, and acts as investment advisor to
      collateralized debt obligations.


Products

Investment
      Management products include U.S. and international equity and fixed-income
      retail mutual funds, institutional separate accounts, institutional mutual
      funds, managed accounts, “529” college savings plans, and retirement plans and
      services, as well as administration services for some of these products.

The
      Investment Management segment’s assets under management (including assets under
      administration) were as follows:


Includes
                $21.9 billion, $14.5 billion and $3.8 billion of sub-advised assets
                at
                December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We pay fees to the
                third
                party subadvisors to manage the assets.


Includes
                insurance-related assets of $44.5 billion, $44.0 billion and $43.0
                billion, at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


Includes
                institutional and retail assets that were managed by the segment’s
                London-based international investment unit (“DIAL”). In the third quarter
                of 2004, the segment sold DIAL to Mondrian. Accordingly, $22.1 billion
                of
                assets were transferred to Mondrian at the time of the sale.

Retail
      Products and Services

The
      Investment Management segment offers various retail products including mutual
      funds to individual investors, as well as investment services to high net worth
      and small institutional investors through managed accounts. The segment also
      provides investment management and account administration services for 401(k)
      variable annuity products and “529” college savings plans.

The
      following table provides a summary of retail assets under management for each
      product:


Includes
                $17.1 billion, $10.7 billion and $3.8 billion of sub-advised assets
                for
                2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

We
      pay
      fees to the third party sub-advisors to manage the assets.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the Investment Management segment, through Delaware, offered
      87 retail mutual funds to suit an array of investment needs. Delaware’s mutual
      funds are grouped by asset class, with each investment management team focused
      on a specific investment discipline. This structure of distinct investment
      teams
      allows for a style-specific research effort tailored for each asset class.
      The
      mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by Delaware.
      Delaware manages the funds. Accordingly, the mutual fund assets and liabilities,
      as well as related investment


returns,
      are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Instead, Delaware
      earns fees for providing the management and other services to the funds.

Delaware
      manages both open-end and closed-end funds. An open-end mutual fund does not
      have a fixed number of shares and will normally offer as many shares as
      investors are willing to buy. Investors sell their shares by requesting the
      fund
      to redeem them. The open-end funds are available with various pricing
      structures, such as A-class with a front end sales charge, B-class and C-class
      with a contingent deferred sales charge as well as R-class and Institutional
      class, which are sold without a front end or contingent deferred sales charge
      and are designed for certain retirement plans. A, B, C and R classes are
      generally subject to Rule 12b-1 fees. A closed-end fund offers a fixed number
      of
      shares and is usually sold through a brokerage firm. After the initial offering,
      shares normally trade on a major stock exchange.

A
      managed
      account is provided to investors through relationships with broker-dealer
      sponsored programs. The 401(k) variable annuity products provide the
      contractholder the ability to direct the investment of deposits into one or
      more
      investment options offered by the product.

Delaware
      has offered “529” college savings plans since 2002, when Delaware launched
      programs for the state of Hawaii and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A 529
      plan is an investment plan operated by a state that is designed to help families
      save for future college costs. Earnings on the assets invested in 529 plans
      grow
      on a tax-deferred basis, and until December 31, 2010 (unless extended by
      Congress), amounts withdrawn from the plans to pay qualified college expenses
      are not taxed. Pennsylvania has both an investment plan and a pre-paid tuition
      plan. Delaware manages the investment plan and provides administration services
      to the pre-paid tuition plan. Hawaii’s program has an investment plan only.
      Delaware’s investment plan type 529 products primarily employ risk-based and
      age-based asset allocation models that enable college-savers to diversify their
      assets across all major investment styles.

The
      Investment Management segment also offers defined contribution retirement
      products. The Lincoln Director

SM

(“Director”) is a defined contribution retirement plan solution available to
      businesses of all sizes, including small- and medium-sized companies. Funded
      through a Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”) group variable annuity
      contract, the Director product offers participants 53 investment options from
      fund families. In New York, Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York
      underwrites the annuity contracts. These contracts offer 50 investment options
      from 14 fund families. Director is offered with fully bundled recordkeeping
      services, but can also be record-kept by third-party retirement administrators.
      The Investment Management segment earns advisory fees, investment income and
      surrender charges from this product.

The
      Investment Management segment also offers a mutual fund-based retirement
      product. In 2004, the recordkeeping portion of this business was outsourced
      to
      third parties. This transition was completed in October 2004. Delaware also
      offers its mutual funds directly on an investment only basis to plans and other
      record-keeping platforms.

Institutional
      Products and Services

For
      institutional clients, the Investment Management segment offers Delaware Pooled
      Trust and institutional separate accounts. Delaware Pooled Trust is a registered
      investment company which offers a series of mutual funds managed in styles
      that
      are similar to institutional separate account offerings and are best suited
      for
      smaller to medium-sized institutional investment mandates. Delaware Pooled
      Trusts’ minimum initial investment is typically $1 million. The funds included
      in Delaware Pooled Trust are offered without a sales charge directly through
      Delaware’s institutional marketing and client services group.

The
      Investment Management segment provides investment advisory services through
      separately managed accounts to a broad range of institutional clients, such
      as
      corporate and public retirement plans, endowments and foundations, nuclear
      decommissioning trusts, sub-advisory clients and Taft-Hartley plans, among
      others. Included among sub-advisory clients are mutual funds and other
      commingled vehicles offered by institutional parties. Most clients utilize
      individually managed separate accounts, which means clients have the opportunity
      to customize the management of their portfolio by including or excluding certain
      types of securities, sectors or segments within a given asset class. Because
      of
      their individually managed nature, these separate accounts are best suited
      for
      larger investment mandates. Currently, the minimum account size is typically
      $25
      million for U.S. investments. The Investment Management segment also provides
      investment management services for Lincoln’s general account assets for which it
      earns advisory revenue.


Distribution

The
      businesses in the Investment Management segment deliver their broad range of
      products through multiple distribution channels, enabling them to reach an
      expanding community of retail and institutional investors. Investment Management
      distributes retail mutual funds, managed accounts, “529” college savings plans
      and retirement products through intermediaries, including LFA, which are
      serviced by the LFD wholesaling distribution network. Delaware Distributors,
      L.P. is the principal underwriter for the Delaware mutual funds and serves
      as a
      liaison between the funds and LFD.

Delaware’s
      institutional marketing group, working closely with manager selection
      consultants, markets substantially all of the institutional products.

Competition

The
      Investment Management segment primarily competes with mutual fund complexes
      that
      are broker sold, and other asset managers offering managed accounts,
      institutional accounts and sub-advisory services, and, with respect to the
      Lincoln Director

SM

,
      other
      insurance companies. Competitive factors impacting the Investment Management
      segment include investment performance, breadth of investment styles offered,
      distribution capabilities and customer service.

Investment
      performance is a key driver of the Investment Management segment’s ability to
      attract new sales, retain existing assets and improve net flows. The following
      table summarizes the performance of institutional and managed accounts relative
      to their respective benchmarks for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended
      December 31, 2005.

                the 8 largest composites based on assets under management. The returns
                for
                these 8 composites are Association for Investment Management and
                Research
                (AIMR) compliant and the benchmarks are industry
                standards.

Delaware
      closely monitors the relative performance of individual funds. Fund performance
      is compared to a benchmark group of peer funds that have similar investment
      characteristics and objectives. Performance in various key categories, as
      reported to Lipper, one of the leading providers of mutual fund research, is
      used by Delaware in measuring its funds’ performance. The following table
      summarizes the performance for the 25 largest mutual funds and for all of the
      mutual funds in the Delaware Investment’s family of funds for the one-, three-
      and five-year periods ended December 31, 2005.


For
                these purposes, Delaware’s family of funds does not include variable
                insurance product funds, or mutual funds managed by Delaware for
                certain
                of our affiliates or other third parties.


Lincoln
      UK

Lincoln
      UK is headquartered in Barnwood, Gloucester, England, and is licensed to do
      business throughout the United Kingdom (“UK”). Lincoln UK is primarily focused
      on protecting and enhancing the value of its existing customer base. The segment
      accepts new deposits on the existing block of business and markets a limited
      range of new products.

Lincoln
      UK’s product portfolio principally consists of unit-linked life and pension
      products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products,
      where the risk associated with the underlying investments are borne by the
      policyholders. These products have largely been issued to individuals, and
      benefits, premium levels and charges can often be varied within limits. Certain
      policyholders have chosen to contract out of the State Second Pension through
      a
      Lincoln personal pension arrangement. Lincoln UK receives rebate premiums from
      the government for those policyholders, and the vast majority of rebate premiums
      are usually received between July and November each year. These rebates are
      reported as deposits and as such only the fees earned by Lincoln UK are reported
      as revenue. In 2005, the total fees received in respect of these rebates
      amounted to $3.9 million.

The
      Lincoln UK segment’s product revenues were as follows. Product revenues include
      premiums, fees and assessments for Lincoln UK’s products:

Our
      subsidiary in the U.K. has its balance sheets and income statements translated
      at the current spot exchange rate as of the year-end and average spot exchange
      rate for the year, respectively.

Lincoln
      UK has an evergreen agreement to outsource its customer service and policy
      administration functions to Capita Life & Pensions Services Limited, a
      subsidiary of Capita Group Plc (“Capita”). The purpose of the outsourcing is to
      reduce the operational risk and variability of future costs associated with
      administering the business by taking advantage of Capita’s proven expertise in
      providing outsourcing solutions to a variety of industries including insurance
      companies. To date, the relationship has provided the segment with results
      in
      line with expectations.

Other
      Operations

“Other
      Operations” include the financial data for the operations of LFA and LFD, and
      for operations that are not directly related to the business segments,
      unallocated corporate items (such as corporate investment income and interest
      expense on short-term and long-term borrowings), along with the ongoing
      amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity reinsurance portion of the
      transaction with Swiss Re.

Revenues
      from Other Operations were as follows:

(1)

LFD
                revenues represent wholesaling allowances paid by our operating segments
                to LFD.

(2)

For
                2003 and 2004, LFA revenues do not include commissions, which were
                paid
                directly to its registered representatives, agents and brokers by
                our
                operating segments. In 2005, the arrangement was changed so that
                LFA
                receives the commission allowance as part of its distribution allowance
                from the operating segments and distributes directly to its registered
                representatives, agents and brokers.

As
      stated
      above, LFD, with principal operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is our
      wholesaling arm, which distributes our life insurance, annuities and investment
      products to a large number of financial intermediaries. LFD was


formed
      in
      2000 to be the single distribution entity for all of our retail products.
      Through its customer-focused relationships with financial intermediaries, we
      believe that LFD’s distribution channels give us access to our target markets,
      while also providing us with market information so that we can tailor our
      products to the needs of our target markets. At December 31, 2005, LFD consists
      of approximately 123 internal and 245 external wholesalers compared to 124
      internal and 238 external wholesalers at December 31, 2004. Both the internal
      and external wholesalers are LFD employees. LFD is organized to penetrate
      multiple distribution channels including the wire/regional, the independent
      planner, the financial institutions, the managing general agent, and the
      corporate specialty markets channels.

LFA,
      with
      principal operations in Fort Wayne, Indiana, is a retail broker/dealer and
      financial planning firm that offers a full range of financial and estate
      planning services. LFA, through its nearly 2,057 agents, brokers and registered
      representatives in 66 offices, offers our annuities, 401(k) plans, pensions,
      term, universal and variable universal life insurance and other wealth
      accumulation and protection products and services. In addition, LFA is
      structured with an open-architecture system, which means LFA’s planners also
      offer products from non-LNC companies. During 2005, LFA changed its compensation
      structure for its planners. During this period, the number of new planners
      recruited to LFA was down relative to prior years, which is partially a result
      of LFA focusing more on recruiting experienced planners than it had
      in prior years.  LFA expects that recruiting trends will improve going
      forward.

REINSURANCE

We
      follow
      the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our life insurance and annuity
      risks with unaffiliated reinsurers. In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer
      agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under
      a
      policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium. We use reinsurance
      to protect our insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on
      individual claims and unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims
      produce an aggregate extraordinary loss. We also use reinsurance to improve
      our
      results by leveraging favorable reinsurance pricing. Although reinsurance does
      not discharge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to
      their
      policyholders for losses insured under the insurance policies, it does make
      the
      assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured
      portion of the risk.

We
      reinsure approximately 85% to 90% of the mortality risk on newly issued life
      insurance contracts. Our policy is to retain no more than $5.0 million on a
      single insured life issued on fixed and variable universal life insurance
      contracts. Additionally, the retention per single insured life for term life
      insurance and for Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI) is $1 million and $2
      million, respectively. Beginning in September 2005, we changed our reinsurance
      program for our primary term products from coinsurance to renewable term and
      from 90% to 80% on a first dollar quota share basis. In January 2006, we changed
      this program from 80% first dollar quota share to an excess of retention
      program.

In
      a
      coinsurance program, the reinsurer shares proportionately in all financial
      terms
      of the reinsured policies, i.e. premiums, expenses, claims, etc. based on their
      respective quota share of the risk. In a renewable term program, the reinsurer
      is paid a renewable term premium to cover the proportionate share of mortality
      risk assumed by the reinsurer. In a first dollar quota share program, the
      reinsurer receives a proportionate share of all risks issued based on their
      respective quota share of the risk. In an excess of retention program, the
      reinsurer assumes a proportionate share of risks that exceed our per life
      retention. With respect to annuities, we have previously reinsured a portion
      of
      our fixed annuity business, but beginning in 2004, we have retained the full
      risk on newly issued contracts.

For
      more
      information regarding reinsurance see, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
      Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and “Reinsurance” in
      the MD&A. For risks involving reinsurance, see “Risk Factors” below.

RESERVES

The
      applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that
      they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on
      their
      outstanding policies. These reserves are the amounts that, with the additional
      premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain
      assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and
      contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall
      not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and
      morbidity tables, interest rates, and methods of valuation.

The
      reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated
      based on GAAP and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states
      and carried in the statutory financial statements of the life insurance
      subsidiaries. These differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity
      tables, interest, persistency and other assumptions which are believed to be
      more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those
      required for statutory accounting


purposes
      and from differences in actuarial reserving methods. See “Regulatory” below for
      information on proposed regulations that may impact the amount of statutory
      reserves necessary to support our current insurance liabilities.

The
      assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation
      of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual
      experience is not less favorable than the reserve assumptions, then reserves
      should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience
      is
      less favorable than the reserve assumptions, additional reserves may be
      required. The key experience assumptions include mortality rates, policy
      persistency and interest rates. We periodically review our experience and update
      our policy reserves for new issues and reserve for all claims incurred, as
      we
      believe appropriate.

For
      risks
      related to reserves, see “Risk Factors” below.

INVESTMENTS

An
      important component of our financial results is the return on invested assets.
      Our investment strategy is to balance the need for current income with prudent
      risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income to
      meet our obligations. This approach requires the evaluation of risk and expected
      return of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives.
      This approach also permits us to be more effective in our asset-liability
      management, since decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current
      investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. Investments
      by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with the insurance laws and
      regulations of the states of domicile.

We
      do not
      use derivatives for speculative purposes. Derivatives are used for hedging
      purposes and income generation. Hedging strategies are employed for a number
      of
      reasons including, but not limited to, hedging certain portions of our exposure
      to changes in our GMDB/GMWB liabilities, interest rate fluctuations, the
      widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity U.S. Government
      obligations, and credit, foreign exchange and equity risks. Income generation
      strategies include credit default swaps through replication synthetic asset
      transactions (RSATs). These derivatives synthetically create exposure in the
      general account to corporate debt, similar to investing in the credit markets.
      Our investment portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in
      single issuers. In addition, we do not have a significant concentration of
      investments in any single industry segment; no single segment comprises more
      than 10% of invested assets at December 31, 2005.

For
      additional information on our investments, including carrying values by
      category, quality ratings and net investment income, see “ Consolidated
      Investments” in the MD&A, as well as Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

RATINGS

Nationally
      recognized ratings agencies rate the financial strength of our principal
      insurance subsidiaries and the debt of LNC. Ratings are not recommendations
      to
      buy our securities.

Rating
      agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability
      to
      pay claims, factors more relevant to policyholders than investors. We believe
      that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized, independent rating agencies
      are material to our operations. There may be other rating agencies that also
      rate our securities, which we do not disclose in our reports.

Insurer
      Financial Strength Ratings

The
      insurer financial strength rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”),
      Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) are
      characterized as follows:


As
      of
      February 28, 2006, the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance
      subsidiaries, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our
      securities, or us, are as follows:

All
      of
      the ratings above have a stable outlook.

A
      downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance
      subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry
      and
      make it more difficult for us to market our products as potential customers
      may
      select companies with higher financial strength ratings.

Debt
      Ratings

A
      downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional
      debt
      with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely
      increase our cost of capital. In addition, a downgrade of these ratings could
      make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt
      obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to
      maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal
      insurance subsidiaries described above.

All
      of
      our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating
      agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that our principal insurance
      subsidiaries or that LNC can maintain these ratings. Each rating should be
      evaluated independently of any other rating.


REGULATORY

General

Our
      insurance subsidiaries, like other insurance companies, are subject to
      regulation and supervision by the states, territories and countries in which
      they are licensed to do business. The extent of such regulation varies, but
      generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory
      and
      administrative authority to supervisory agencies. In the United States, this
      power is vested in state insurance departments.

In
      supervising and regulating insurance companies, state insurance departments,
      charged primarily with protecting policyholders and the public rather than
      investors, enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance
      laws and regulation for that purpose. Two of our principal insurance
      subsidiaries, LNL and First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Company (“First Penn”),
      are domiciled in Indiana, and the other, Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of
      New York (“LLANY”), is domiciled in New York. The insurance departments of those
      states exercise principal regulatory jurisdiction over them. The extent of
      regulation by the states varies, but in general, most jurisdictions have laws
      and regulations governing standards of solvency, adequacy of reserves,
      reinsurance, capital adequacy, licensing of companies and agents to transact
      business, prescribing and approving policy forms, regulating premium rates
      for
      some lines of business, prescribing the form and content of financial statements
      and reports, regulating the type and amount of investments permitted and
      standards of business conduct.

As
      a
      result of being an accredited reinsurer in New York, LNL is also an authorized
      insurer in the state of New York. As such, LNL is subject to the regulatory
      requirements imposed by New York on authorized insurers. One such requirement
      is
      that LNL must report to New York its reserves based on New York reserving
      regulations, which are generally more conservative than those of Indiana. An
      example of this is on December 29, 2004, the New York State Insurance Department
      promulgated, as an emergency measure, amendments to its regulations governing
      the valuation of life insurance reserves for New York authorized insurers
      issuing certain life insurance policies. Specifically, the amendments apply
      to
      life insurance policies providing secondary guarantees, such as policies with
      our LPR (as discussed above), that allow those policies to remain in force
      at
      the original schedule of benefits, even if the policy’s cash value is depleted,
      as long as the contractual requirements to maintain the secondary guarantee
      are
      satisfied. The amendments apply to policies issued on or after January 1, 2003
      through July 1, 2005. We do not currently expect these changes to affect LNL’s
      ability to continue as an authorized insurer in New York. However, as discussed
      further below under “—Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other
      Payments,” if New York requires us to maintain a higher level of capital to
      remain an authorized insurer in New York, these requirements may constrain
      LNL’s
      ability to pay dividends to us.

State
      insurance departments in jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries
      do
      business conduct periodic examinations of their respective operations and
      accounts and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to their
      financial condition. LLANY is currently undergoing a triennial examination
      by
      the New York State Insurance Department. State insurance laws and regulations
      also include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of
      insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure
      to
      consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling.
      State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic
      market conduct examinations.

The
      U.S.
      federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry; however,
      federal initiatives from time to time can impact the insurance industry. In
      June
      2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (“EGTRRA”)
      was enacted. EGTRRA contains provisions that will, over time, significantly
      lower individual tax rates. This will have the effect of reducing the benefits
      of tax deferral on the inside build-up of annuities and life insurance products.
      EGTRRA also includes provisions that will eliminate, over time, the estate,
      gift
      and generation-skipping taxes and partially eliminates the step-up in basis
      rule
      applicable to property held in a decedent’s estate. Some of these changes might
      hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance and annuity
      products. Many of these provisions expire in 2010, unless extended.

In
      May
      2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Act”)
      was enacted. Individual taxpayers are the principal beneficiaries of the 2003
      Act, which includes an acceleration of certain of the income tax rate reductions
      enacted originally under EGTRRA, as well as capital gains and dividend tax
      rate
      reductions. Although most of these rate reductions expire after 2008 or later,
      these reductions have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on
      the
      build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products. Like the EGTRRA
      changes, the 2003 Act changes may hinder our sales and result in increased
      surrender of insurance and annuity products.


On
      October 22, 2004, President Bush signed into law the American Jobs Creation
      Act
      of 2004 (“AJCA”). Among its various provisions, the AJCA includes a provision
      that temporarily suspends current rules that impose an income tax on a stock
      life insurance company for distributions to its shareholders from its
      policyholder surplus account. It also reverses the order in which distributions
      are charged against a company’s various accounts, such that distributions will
      first be treated as coming from the policyholder surplus account and then the
      shareholders surplus account. Our dividend activity in 2004 and 2005 was
      sufficient to eliminate our insurance subsidiaries’ policyholder surplus
      accounts.

In
      addition, the AJCA includes provisions affecting non-qualified deferred
      compensation plans that may make such plans more complicated for employers
      depending on final tax rules and regulations. Because our COLI products are
      often used to support such deferred compensation liabilities, the AJCA may
      constrain sales of our COLI products. COLI legislation has now passed in the
      Senate and if such legislation is signed into law, it is expected to provide
      more certainty in the COLI market, and therefore, is not expected to have a
      detrimental effect on COLI markets in which we participate.

In
      February 2005, bills were introduced in Congress to provide tax incentives
      designed to encourage individuals to invest their after-tax income in retirement
      vehicles, such as annuities, that provide guaranteed lifetime income. Under
      the
      proposal, individuals would not pay federal taxes on one-half of the income
      generated by annuities that make lifetime payments up to an annual limit of
      $20,000. If this bill is enacted into law, we believe that it would have a
      favorable impact on our annuity business.

In
      February 2006, the Bush Administration proposed that many of the temporary
      rate
      reductions from EGTRRA and the 2003 Act be made permanent. It continues to
      propose tax-favored savings initiatives that, if enacted by Congress, could
      also
      adversely affect the sale of our annuity, life and tax-qualified retirement
      products and increase the surrender of such products. However, we expect that
      the income for life guarantee provided within an annuity and features like
      our
      GMWB will continue to be viewed as significant benefits and may offset the
      adverse effect of these proposals.

In
      addition, LFA and LFD as well as our variable annuities and variable life
      insurance products are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC and
      the
      National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”). Our Investment Management
      segment, like other investment management groups, is subject to regulation
      and
      supervision by the SEC, NASD, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”),
      the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and jurisdictions of the states,
      territories and foreign countries in which they are licensed to do business.
      Lincoln UK is subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”)
      in the U.K.

Some
      of
      our separate accounts as well as mutual funds that we sponsor, in addition
      to
      being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, are registered as investment
      companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the shares of certain
      of
      these entities are qualified for sale in some or all states and the District
      of
      Columbia. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as
      broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and
      are subject to federal and state regulation, including but not limited to the
      NASD’s net capital rules. In addition, we have several subsidiaries that are
      investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. LFA’s
      agents and our employees, insofar as they are involved in the sale or marketing
      of products that are securities, are subject to the Exchange Act and to
      examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, the NASD and state
      securities commissioners. Regulation also extends to various LNC entities that
      employ or control those individuals. The SEC and other governmental agencies
      and
      self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the
      United States, have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can
      result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension,
      termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its
      employees.

Federal
      and state regulators are devoting substantial attention to the mutual fund
      and
      variable annuity businesses. As a result of publicity relating to widespread
      perceptions of industry abuses, there have been numerous proposals for
      legislative and regulatory reforms, addressing issues which include, but are
      not
      limited to, the need for increased mutual fund governance and compliance
      practices, late trading, suitability of variable annuity products, directed
      brokerage and soft dollars, and new disclosure requirements concerning
      commission breakpoints, revenue sharing, shelf space, advisory fees, market
      timing, portfolio pricing, information about portfolio managers and other
      issues. It is difficult to predict at this time whether changes resulting from
      new laws and regulations will affect the industries or our asset management
      businesses, and, if so, to what degree.

Insurance
      Holding Company Regulation

LNC
      and
      its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the insurance
      holding company laws of the states of Indiana and New York. These insurance
      holding company laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers
      that are members of such insurance holding company’s system to register with the
      insurance department authorities,


to
      file
      with it certain reports disclosing information including their capital
      structure, ownership, management, financial condition, certain intercompany
      transactions, including material transfers of assets and intercompany business
      agreements, and to report material changes in that information. These laws
      also
      require that intercompany transactions be fair and reasonable and, under certain
      circumstances, prior approval of the insurance departments must be received
      before entering into an intercompany transaction. Further, these laws require
      that an insurer’s policyholders’ surplus following any dividends or
      distributions to shareholder affiliates is reasonable in relation to the
      insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs.

In
      general, under state holding company regulations, no person may acquire,
      directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in our capital stock unless
      such
      person, corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the
      applicable insurance commissioner for such acquisition of control. Pursuant
      to
      such laws, in general, any person acquiring, controlling or holding the power
      to
      vote, directly or indirectly, ten percent or more of the voting securities
      of an
      insurance company, is presumed to have “control” of such company. This
      presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact.
      The insurance commissioner, however, may find that “control” exists in
      circumstances in which a person owns or controls a smaller amount of voting
      securities. To obtain approval from the insurance commissioner of any
      acquisition of control of an insurance company, the proposed acquirer must
      file
      with the applicable commissioner an application containing information
      regarding: the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates;
      the
      nature, source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition;
      the
      financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates; any potential plans
      for
      disposition of the securities or business of the insurer; the number and type
      of
      securities to be acquired; any contracts with respect to the securities to
      be
      acquired; any agreements with broker-dealers; and other matters.

Other
      jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact
      business may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of
      any
      acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or
      authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions. Additional requirements
      in those jurisdictions may include re-licensing or subsequent approval for
      renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control. As further
      described below, laws that govern the holding company structure also govern
      payment of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries.

Restrictions
      on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments

We
      are a
      holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and
      indirectly through subsidiaries. Our primary assets are the stock of our
      operating subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding
      debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends
      on
      the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries
      to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us.

In
      addition, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department
      regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends
      to
      the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance
      subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends
      to LNC only from unassigned surplus, without prior approval of the Indiana
      Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), or must receive prior approval of
      the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other
      dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months, would exceed
      the
      statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of (i)
      10%
      of the insurer’s policyholders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement
      on file with the Commissioner or (ii) the insurer’s statutory net gain from
      operations for the previous twelve months, but in no event to exceed statutory
      unassigned surplus. Indiana law gives Commissioner broad discretion to
      disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits.

Indiana
      law also provides that following the payment of any dividend, the insurer’s
      policyholders’ surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding
      liabilities and adequate for its financial needs, and permits the Indiana
      Insurance Commissioner to bring an action to rescind a dividend which violates
      these standards. In the event that the Indiana Insurance Commissioner determines
      that the policyholders’ surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate, the
      Commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to
      require us to apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit
      of
      that insurance subsidiary. For information regarding dividends paid to us during
      2005 from our insurance subsidiaries, see “Review of Consolidated Financial
      Condition—Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” in our MD&A.

As
      stated
      above, LNL is also an authorized insurer in the state of New York. As a result,
      it is also subject to the regulatory requirements that the state of New York
      imposes upon authorized insurers. These regulations include reserve
      requirements, which differ from Indiana’s requirements. The New York regulations
      require LNL to report more reserves to the state of New York. As a result,
      the
      level of statutory surplus that LNL reports to New York is less than the
      statutory surplus reported to Indiana and the National Association of Insurance
      Commissioners (“NAIC”). If New York requires us to maintain a higher level of
      capital to remain an authorized insurer in New York, LNL’s ability to pay
      dividends to LNC could be constrained. However, we do not expect the New York
      reserve requirements to constrain LNL’s ability to pay dividends


during
      2006. For further information on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
      dividends to us, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition—Sources of
      Liquidity and Cash Flow” in the MD&A.

Lincoln
      UK’s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the U.K. FSA and are subject to
      capital requirements as defined by the U.K. Capital Resources Requirement
      (formerly the Required Minimum Solvency Margin). Lincoln UK targets maintaining
      approximately 1.5 to 2.0 times the required capital as prescribed by the
      regulatory resource requirement. Effective January 1, 2005, all insurance
      companies operating in the U.K. also have to complete a risk-based capital
      (“RBC”) assessment to demonstrate to the FSA that they hold sufficient capital
      to cover their risks. RBC requirements in the U.K. are different than the NAIC
      requirements. In addition, the FSA imposes certain minimum capital requirements
      for the combined U.K. subsidiaries. As is the case with regulated insurance
      companies in the U.S., future changes to regulatory capital requirements could
      impact the dividend capacity of our U.K. insurance subsidiaries and cash flow
      to
      the holding company.

Risk-Based
      Capital

The
      NAIC
      has adopted risk-based capital requirements for life insurance companies to
      evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment
      and insurance risks. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum
      amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support
      its
      overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. There are five
      major risks involved in determining the requirements.

A
      company’s risk-based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and
      performing calculations relating to various asset, premium, claim, expense
      and
      reserve items. Regulators can then measure adequacy of a company’s statutory
      surplus by comparing it to the risk-based capital determined by the formula.
      Under RBC requirements, regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of
      a
      company’s total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to its company action
      level of RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as defined by the NAIC.

Four
      levels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the RBC ratio is
      insufficient:

At
      December 31, 2005, the RBC ratios of LNL, First Penn and LLANY reported to
      their
      respective states of domicile and the NAIC were 437%, 585% and 691%,
      respectively.


We
      believe that we will be able to maintain the RBC ratios of our insurance
      subsidiaries in excess of “Company action level” through prudent underwriting,
      claims handling, investing and capital management. However, no assurances can
      be
      given that developments affecting the insurance subsidiaries, many of which
      could be outside of our control, including but not limited to changes in the
      regulatory environment, including changes to the manner in which the RBC ratio
      is calculated, economic conditions and competitive conditions in the
      jurisdictions in which we write business, will not cause the RBC ratios to
      fall
      below required levels resulting in a corresponding regulatory response.

The
      NAIC
      and the Life and Health Actuarial Task Force adopted in 2005 new requirements
      for calculating the RBC in connection with variable annuity products with death
      and living benefit guarantees (C3 Phase 2). The new C3 Phase 2 requirements
      are
      effective as of December 31, 2005 and include transition rules where the RBC
      amount for these products are the sum of 20% multiplied by the C3 Phase 2
      calculated amount and 80% multiplied by the previous RBC amount held for these
      products. The RBC ratios shown above for LNL, First Penn and LLANY include
      the
      effect of the C3 Phase 2 calculation where appropriate.

Under C3 Phase 1 testing, a component of RBC for fixed annuity policies is
      determined using projections of the business under various interest rate
      scenarios instead of a prescribed factor. If the business is significant as
      measured by specific tests required by the NAIC, then the C3 Phase 1 testing
      is
      required.   If the business is not significant, then the prescribed
      factor may be used. The NAIC currently allows companies to elect to perform
      C3
      Phase 1 testing even if not required to perform the calculation.  Companies
      making the C3 Phase 1 election are required to do the testing in future years
      and cannot return to the prescribed factor approach. In calculating its 2005
      RBC, LNL has elected to perform C3 Phase 1 testing.

EMPLOYEES

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had a total of 5,259 employees. None of our employees
      are
      represented by a labor union, and we are not a party to any collective
      bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.

AVAILABLE
      INFORMATION

We
      file
      annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents
      with
      the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
      Act”). The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at
      the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549.
      The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference
      Room
      by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Also, the SEC maintains an Internet
      website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other
      information regarding issuers, including LNC, that file electronically with
      the
      SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at

Item
      1A.

Risk
      Factors

You
      should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our
      securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones
      facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
      to us
      or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
      If
      any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results
      of operations could be materially affected. In that case, the value of our
      securities could decline substantially. For additional risks concerning our
      previously announced merger with Jefferson-Pilot, see Amendment No. 1
      to our Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-130226).

Risk
      Factors in connection with Our Business

Our
      reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and
      future business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may
      prove to be inadequate.

Our
      reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate.
      We
      establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much
      we
      will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For our life insurance and
      annuity products, we calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and
      estimates, including estimated premiums we will receive over the assumed life
      of
      the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy, the amount
      of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the assets we
      purchase with the premiums we receive. The assumptions and estimates we use
      in
      connection with establishing and carrying our reserves are inherently uncertain.
      Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we
      will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits and claims or whether
      the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume
      prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our actual experience is different
      from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove to be inadequate
      in
      relation to our estimated future benefits and claims. As a result, we would
      incur a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which we increase our reserves.

Because
      the equity markets and interest rates impact our profitability, changes in
      equity markets and interest rates may also negatively affect our business and
      profitability.

The
      fee
      revenue that we earn on equity-based variable annuities, unit-linked accounts,
      variable universal life insurance policies and investment advisory business,
      is
      based upon account values. Because strong equity markets result in higher
      account values, strong equity markets positively affect our net income through
      increased fee revenue. In addition, the increased fee revenue resulting from
      strong equity markets increases the expected gross profits (“EGPs”) from
      variable insurance products. As a result, the higher EGPs may result in lower
      net amortized costs related to deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), deferred
      sales inducements (“DSI”), the present value of in-force business (“PVIF”), and
      deferred front-end sales loads (“DFEL”) associated with those products. For more
      information on DAC, DSI, PVIF and DFEL amortization, see “Critical Accounting
      Policies” in the MD&A. Finally, the amount of reserves related to the GMDB
      for variable annuities is tied to the difference between the value of the
      underlying accounts and the guaranteed death benefit, which is a benefit ratio
      (present value of total expected GMDB payments over the life of the contract
      divided by the present value of total expected assessments over the life of
      the
      contract). Both the level of expected GMDB payments and expected total
      assessments used in calculating this benefit ratio are affected by the equity
      markets. Accordingly, strong equity markets will decrease the amount of GMDB
      reserves that we must carry.

Conversely,
      a weakening of the equity markets results in lower fee income and, depending
      upon the significance of the drop in the equity markets, may result in higher
      net expenses associated with DAC, DSI, PVIF and DFEL. Both lower fee income
      and
      higher net expenses may have a material adverse effect on our results of
      operations and capital resources. Furthermore, a decrease in the equity markets
      will increase the net amount at risk under the GMDB benefits we offer as part
      of
      our variable annuity products, which has the effect of increasing the amount
      of
      GMDB reserves that we must carry. As a result, if such reserves are not
      reasonable in relation to our expected liabilities for GMDB, it would
      likely result in an increase in GMDB payments and would result in a
      decrease in the present value of total expected assessments over the life of
      the
      contract. The result would be an increase the level of the GMDB reserves. Such
      an increase in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings in the quarter
      in which we increase our reserves to bring them within a reasonable range of
      our
      estimated future liabilities related to the GMDB guarantees.

Because
      the profitability of our fixed annuity and interest-sensitive whole life,
      universal life and fixed portion of variable universal life insurance business
      depends in part on interest rate spreads, interest rate fluctuations could
      negatively affect our profitability. Jefferson-Pilot also offers products the
      profitability of which depends in part on interest rate spreads. Accordingly,
      our merger with Jefferson-Pilot may exacerbate this risk.


Changes
      in interest rates may reduce both our profitability from spread businesses
      and
      our return on invested capital. Some of our products, principally fixed
      annuities and interest-sensitive whole life, universal life and the fixed
      portion of variable universal life insurance, expose us to the risk that changes
      in interest rates will reduce our “spread”, or the difference between the
      amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the amounts we
      are
      able to earn on our general account investments intended to support our
      obligations under the contracts. Declines in our spread from these products
      could have a material adverse effect on our businesses or results of operations.

In
      periods of increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the assets
      in our general account with higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher
      crediting rates necessary to keep our interest sensitive products competitive.
      We therefore may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability
      or
      face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related
      assets. In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash
      we
      receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding
      instruments then available. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income
      securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general
      account in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk.
      Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities
      only at limited, pre-established intervals, and since many of our policies
      have
      guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease
      and
      potentially become negative.

Increases
      in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance
      products. In periods of increasing interest rates, policy loans and surrenders
      and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase
      as
      policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns. This process
      may lead to a flow of cash out of our businesses. These outflows may require
      investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are
      lower
      because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized
      investment losses. A sudden demand among consumers to change product types
      or
      withdraw funds could lead us to sell assets at a loss to meet the demand for
      funds. In addition, unanticipated withdrawals and terminations also may require
      us to accelerate DAC, DSI, PVIF and DFEL amortization. This would increase
      our
      current expenses.

A
      downgrade in our claims-paying or credit ratings could limit our ability to
      market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered
      and/or hurt our relationships with creditors.

Nationally
      recognized rating agencies rate the financial strength of our principal
      insurance subsidiaries and the debt of LNC. Ratings are not recommendations
      to
      buy our securities. Please see “Ratings” beginning on page 17

for a
      complete description of our ratings.

Our
      claims-paying ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet
      policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence
      in
      most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. The interest rates
      we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings. Each
      of
      the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically, and our current ratings
      may not be maintained in the future. A downgrade of the financial strength
      rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our
      competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for
      us
      to market our products as potential customers may select companies with higher
      financial strength ratings. This could lead to a decrease in fees as outflows
      of
      assets increase, and therefore, result in lower fee income. Furthermore, sales
      of assets to meet customer withdrawal demands could also result in losses,
      depending on market conditions. A downgrade of our debt ratings could affect
      our
      ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our
      current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital. In addition,
      a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital
      to
      refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our
      insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength
      ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above.

A
      drop in the rankings of the mutual funds that we manage as well as a loss of
      key
      portfolio managers could result in lower advisory fees.

While
      mutual funds are not rated, per se, many industry periodicals and services,
      such
      as Lipper, provide rankings of mutual fund performance. Under “—Investment
      Management,” we have disclosed the number of our 25 largest retail mutual funds
      (based on assets under management), as well as all of our retail mutual funds,
      that rank in the top half of their Lipper category for the one-, three- and
      five-year periods ended December 31, 2005. These rankings often have an impact
      on the decisions of customers regarding which mutual funds to invest in. If
      the
      rankings of the mutual funds for which we provide advisory services decrease
      materially, the funds’ assets may decrease as customers leave for funds with
      higher performance rankings. Similarly, a loss of our key portfolio managers
      who
      manage mutual fund investments could result in poorer fund performance, as
      well
      as customers leaving these mutual funds for new mutual funds managed by the
      portfolio managers. Any loss of fund assets would decrease the advisory fees
      that we earn from such mutual funds, which are generally tied to the amount
      of
      fund assets and performance. This would have an adverse effect on our results
      of
      operations.


Our
      businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our
      profitability.

Our
      insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation
      in
      the states in which we do business. The supervision and regulation relate to
      numerous aspects of our business and financial condition. The primary purpose
      of
      the supervision and regulation is the protection of our insurance policyholders,
      and not our investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is
      governed by state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory
      and
      administrative authority to state insurance departments. This system of
      supervision and regulation covers, among other things:

The
      regulations of the state insurance departments may affect the cost or demand
      for
      our products and may impede us from taking actions we might wish to take to
      increase our profitability. For example, in July 2005, a committee of the NAIC
      adopted a change to Actuarial Guideline 38 (also known as “AXXX”), the statutory
      reserve requirements for UL products with secondary guarantees, such as LNL’s
      LPR product. This proposal was formally adopted by the NAIC in 2005 with an
      effective date of July 1, 2005.

The
      proposal does not affect business written prior to the effective date of July
      1,
      2005. We continue to evaluate potential modifications to our universal life
      products with secondary guarantees that may be made in response to the revised
      regulation. Although the impact of this proposal on future sales of guaranteed
      no-lapse UL cannot be predicted, it may result in a price increase for such
      products, and therefore, may lower sales of such products.

Further,
      we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our
      business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and
      regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and
      regulations, which may change from time to time. Also, regulatory authorities
      have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and
      approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not
      comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory
      authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some
      or
      all of our activities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory
      authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision,
      which permit such authorities to supervise the business and operations of an
      insurance company. As of December 31, 2005, no state insurance regulatory
      authority had imposed on us any substantial fines or revoked or suspended any
      of
      our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order
      of
      supervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, which would have a
      material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

In
      addition, LFA and LFD as well as our variable annuities and variable life
      insurance products are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC and
      the
      NASD. Our Investment Management segment, like other investment management
      groups, is subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, NASD, MSRB, the
      Pennsylvania Department of Banking and jurisdictions of the states, territories
      and foreign countries in which they are licensed to do business. Lincoln UK
      is
      subject to regulation by the FSA in the U.K. These laws and regulations
      generally grant supervisory agencies and self-regulatory organizations broad
      administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the subsidiaries
      from carrying on their businesses in the event that they fail to comply with
      such laws and regulations.


Many
      of
      the foregoing regulatory or governmental bodies have the authority to review
      our
      products and business practices and those of our agents and employees. In recent
      years, there has been increased scrutiny of our businesses by these bodies,
      which has included more extensive examinations, regular “sweep” inquiries and
      more detailed review of disclosure documents. These regulatory or governmental
      bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their
      view,
      our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions
      can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions
      on
      our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our
      business, results of operations or financial condition.

For
      further information on regulatory matters relating to us, see “Regulatory
      Matters” above.

Legal
      and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in
      financial losses or harm our businesses.

There
      continues to be a significant amount of federal and state regulatory activity
      in
      the industry relating to numerous issues including, but not limited to, market
      timing and late trading of mutual fund and variable insurance products and
      broker-dealer access arrangements. Like others in the industry, we have received
      inquiries including requests for information and/or subpoenas from various
      authorities including the SEC, the NASD and the New York Attorney General,
      as
      well as notices of potential proceedings from the SEC and NASD. We are in the
      process of responding to, and in some cases have settled or are in the process
      of settling, certain of these inquiries and potential proceedings. We continue
      to cooperate fully with such authorities. In addition, we are, and in the future
      may be, subject to legal actions in the ordinary course of our insurance and
      investment management operations, both domestically and internationally. Pending
      legal actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and
      operations that are specific to us, and proceedings that are typical of the
      businesses in which we operate. Some of these proceedings have been brought
      on
      behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters,
      the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including
      punitive or exemplary damages. Substantial legal liability in these or future
      legal or regulatory actions could have a material financial effect or cause
      significant harm to our reputation, which in turn could materially harm our
      business prospects.

Changes
      in federal income tax law could make some of our products less attractive to
      consumers and increase our tax costs.

EGTRRA
      as
      well as the 2003 Act contain provisions that will, over time, significantly
      lower individual tax rates. This will have the effect of reducing the benefits
      of deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products.
      EGTRRA also includes provisions that will eliminate, over time, the estate,
      gift
      and generation-skipping taxes and partially eliminate the step-up in basis
      rule
      applicable to property held in a decedent’s estate. Many of these provisions
      expire in 2008 and 2010, unless extended. The Bush Administration continues
      to
      propose that many of the foregoing rate reductions be made permanent, as well
      as
      several tax-favored savings initiatives, such as the elimination of the estate
      tax, that, if enacted by Congress, could also adversely affect the sale of
      our
      annuity, life and tax-qualified retirement products and increase the surrender
      of such products. Although we cannot predict the overall effect on the sales
      of
      our products of the tax law changes included in these Acts, some of these
      changes might hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of
      insurance products.

Our
      risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified
      or
      unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our businesses or result
      in
      losses.

We
      have
      devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and
      procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our
      policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully
      effective. Many of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon
      our
      use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical
      models. As a result, these methods may not predict future exposures, which
      could
      be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate, such as the
      risk
      of pandemics causing a large number of deaths. Other risk management methods
      depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients,
      catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise
      accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or
      properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks
      requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and
      verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and
      procedures may not be fully effective.

Because
      we are a holding company with no direct operations, the inability of our
      subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability
      to meet our obligations and pay future dividends.

We
        are a
        holding company, and we have no direct operations. Our principal asset is
        the
        capital stock of our insurance and investment management subsidiaries. Our
        ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on


outstanding
        debt obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses
        depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability
        of our
        subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. Payments
        of
        dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our subsidiaries are
        restricted by the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions, including
        laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Changes in these
        laws, such as New York State amendments to its statutory reserve requirements,
        can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance
        or
        repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our
        debt
        obligations and corporate expenses.

We
      face a risk of non-collectibility of reinsurance, which could materially affect
      our results of operations.

We
      follow
      the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance
      companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance
      subsidiaries (known as ceding). At the end of 2005, we have ceded approximately
      $256.7 billion of life insurance in-force to reinsurers for reinsurance
      protection. Although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their
      primary obligation to pay policyholders for losses insured under the policies
      we
      issue, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance
      subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk. As of December 31, 2005,
      we
      had $6.9 billion of reinsurance receivables from reinsurers for paid and unpaid
      losses, for which they are obligated to reimburse us under our reinsurance
      contracts. Of this amount, $4.1 billion relates to the sale of our reinsurance
      business to Swiss Re in 2001 through an indemnity reinsurance agreement. During
      2004, Swiss Re funded a trust to support this business. The balance in the
      trust
      changes as a result of ongoing reinsurance activity and was $1.7 billion at
      December 31, 2005. In addition, should Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc.
      (“SRLHA”) financial strength ratings drop below either S&P AA- or AM Best A
      or their NAIC risk based capital ratio fall below 250%, assets equal to the
      reserves supporting business reinsured must be placed into a trust according
      to
      pre-established asset quality guidelines. Furthermore, approximately $2.0
      billion of the Swiss Re treaties are funds-withheld structures where we have
      a
      right of offset on assets backing the reinsurance receivables. The balance
      of
      the reinsurance is due from a diverse group of reinsurers. The collectibility
      of
      reinsurance is largely a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers.
      We perform annual credit reviews on our reinsurers, focusing on, among other
      things, financial capacity, stability, trends and commitment to the reinsurance
      business. We also require assets in trust, letters of credit or other acceptable
      collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact
      business in the applicable jurisdictions. Despite these measures, a reinsurer’s
      insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of
      a
      reinsurance contract, especially Swiss Re, could have a material adverse effect
      on our results of operations and financial condition.

Significant
      adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of, or higher prices for,
      reinsurance.

We
      reinsure approximately 85% to 90% of the mortality risk on fully underwritten
      newly issued life insurance contracts. Our current policy is to retain no more
      than $5.0 million on a single insured life issued on fixed and variable
      universal life insurance contracts. Additionally, the retention per single
      insured life for term life insurance and for Corporate Owned Life Insurance
      (COLI) is $1 million and $2 million, respectively. Beginning in September 2005,
      we changed our reinsurance program for our primary term products from
      coinsurance to renewable term and from 90% to 80% on a first dollar quota share
      basis. In January 2006, we changed this program from 80% first dollar quota
      share to an excess of retention program.

In
      a
      coinsurance program, the reinsurer shares proportionately in all financial
      terms
      of the reinsured policies, i.e. premiums, expenses, claims, etc. based on their
      respective quota share of the risk. In a renewable term program, the reinsurer
      is paid a renewable term premium to cover the proportionate share of mortality
      risk assumed by the reinsurer. In a first dollar quota share program, the
      reinsurer receives a proportionate share of all risks issued based on their
      respective quota share of the risk. In an excess of retention program, the
      reinsurer assumes a proportionate share of risks that exceed our per life
      retention.

These
      retention limits are reviewed regularly for continued appropriateness and may
      be
      changed in the future. If we were to experience adverse mortality experience,
      a
      significant portion of that would be reimbursed by our reinsurers. Prolonged
      or
      severe adverse mortality experience could result in increased reinsurance costs
      and ultimately, reinsurers not willing to offer coverage. If we are unable
      to
      maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection
      in amounts that we consider sufficient, we would either have to be willing
      to
      accept an increase in our net exposures or revise our pricing to reflect higher
      reinsurance premiums. If this were to occur, we may be exposed to reduced
      profitability and cash flow strain or we may not be able to price new business
      at competitive rates.

We
      may be unable to attract and retain sales representatives and other employees,
      particularly financial advisors.

We
      compete to attract and retain financial advisors, portfolio managers and other
      employees, as well as independent distributors of our products. Intense
      competition exists for persons and independent distributors with demonstrated
      ability.


We
      compete with other financial institutions primarily on the basis of our
      products, compensation, support services and financial position. Sales in our
      businesses and our results of operations and financial condition could be
      materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining
      financial advisors, portfolio managers and other employees, as well as
      independent distributors of our products. For example, in 2005, we changed
      the
      compensation structure for LFA’s financial advisors. Although we believe the new
      compensation structure will benefit us, our policyholders and our planners,
      if a
      significant number of financial advisors terminate their affiliation with us,
      it
      could have a negative impact on our sales and ability to retain existing
      in-force business.   During 2005, the number of new planners recruited
      to LFA was down relative to prior years, which is partially a result of LFA
      focusing more on recruiting experienced planners than in it had
      in prior years.

Our
      sales representatives are not captive and may sell products of our competitors.

We
      sell
      our annuity and life insurance products through independent sales
      representatives. These representatives are not captive, which means they may
      also sell our competitors’ products. If our competitors offer products that are
      more attractive than ours, or pay higher commission rates to the sales
      representatives than we do, these representatives may concentrate their efforts
      in selling our competitors’ products instead of ours.

Intense
      competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our
      profitability.

Our
      businesses are intensely competitive. We compete based on a number of factors
      including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice,
      investment performance, product features, price, perceived financial strength,
      and claims-paying and credit ratings. Our competitors include insurers,
      broker-dealers, financial advisors, asset managers and other financial
      institutions. A number of our business units face competitors that have greater
      market share, offer a broader range of products or have higher claims-paying
      or
      credit ratings than we do.

In
      recent
      years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies
      in the financial services industry resulting in increased competition from
      large, well-capitalized financial services firms. Many of these firms also
      have
      been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual
      arrangements. Furthermore, larger competitors may have lower operating costs
      and
      an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength
      ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively.
      We
      expect consolidation to continue and perhaps accelerate in the future, thereby
      increasing competitive pressure on us.

Losses
      due to defaults by others could reduce our profitability or negatively affect
      the value of our investments.

Third
      parties that owe us money, securities or other assets may not pay or perform
      their obligations. These parties include the issuers whose securities we hold,
      borrowers under the mortgage loans we make, customers, trading counterparties,
      counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers and other
      financial intermediaries. These parties may default on their obligations to
      us
      due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate
      values, operational failure, corporate governance issues or other reasons.
      A
      downturn in the U.S. and other economies could result in increased impairments.

Anti-takeover
      provisions could delay, deter or prevent our change in control even if the
      change in control would be beneficial to LNC shareholders.

We
      are an
      Indiana corporation subject to Indiana state law. Certain provisions of Indiana
      law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control
      events affecting us. Also, provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws
      and other agreements to which we are a party could delay, deter or prevent
      our
      change in control, even if a change in control would be beneficial to
      shareholders. In addition, under Indiana law, directors may, in considering
      the
      best interests of a corporation, consider the effects of any action on
      stockholders, employees, suppliers and customers of the corporation and the
      communities in which offices and other facilities are located, and other factors
      the directors consider pertinent. One statutory provision prohibits, except
      under specified circumstances, LNC from engaging in any business combination
      with any shareholder who owns 10% or more of our common stock (which
      shareholder, under the statute, would be considered an “interested shareholder”)
      for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder became
      an
      interested shareholder, unless such business combination is approved by the
      board of directors prior to such person becoming an interested shareholder.
      In
      addition, our articles of incorporation contain a provision requiring holders
      of
      at least three-fourths of our voting shares then outstanding and entitled to
      vote at an election of directors, voting together, to approve a transaction
      with
      an interested shareholder rather than the simple majority required under Indiana
      law.

In
      addition to the anti-takeover provisions of Indiana law, there are other factors
      that may delay, deter or prevent our change in control. As an insurance holding
      company, we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to


the
      insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company
      subsidiaries are domiciled. The insurance holding company acts and regulations
      restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company
      without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes and regulations, without
      such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security
      of a
      domestic insurance company, or an insurance holding company which controls
      an
      insurance company, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of
      such
      transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company or
      insurance company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect
      power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
      person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or
      controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person.

Risk
      Factors in connection with the Jefferson-Pilot Merger

The
      announcement and pendency of the merger with Jefferson-Pilot, whether or not
      the
      merger is completed, could cause disruptions in our and Jefferson-Pilot’s
      businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our business and
      financial results.

Whether
      or

not

the
      merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause
      disruptions in our and Jefferson-Pilot’s businesses. Specifically:

·

current
                and prospective employees and agents may experience uncertainty about
                their future roles with the resulting company, which might adversely
                affect our and Jefferson-Pilot’s ability to retain key managers and other
                employees and agents; and

·

the
                attention of our and Jefferson-Pilot’s management may be directed toward
                the completion of the merger and not their ongoing
                businesses.

The
      merger is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or
      waived, will result in the merger not being completed, which may cause the
      market price of our common stock to decline.

The
      merger is subject to customary conditions to closing, including the receipt
      of
      required regulatory approvals and approvals of our and Jefferson-Pilot’s
      shareholders. If any condition to the merger is not satisfied or waived, to
      the
      extent permitted by law or stock exchange rule, the merger will not be
      completed. In addition, we and Jefferson-Pilot may terminate the merger
      agreement under certain circumstances. If we and Jefferson-Pilot do not complete
      the merger, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate to the extent
      that the current market prices of those shares reflect a market assumption
      that
      the merger will be completed. Further, whether or not the merger is completed,
      we will also be obligated to pay certain investment banking, financing, legal
      and accounting fees and related expenses in connection with the merger, which
      could negatively impact results of operations when incurred. In addition,
      neither company would realize any of the expected benefits of having completed
      the merger. If the merger is not completed, we cannot assure our shareholders
      that additional risks will not materialize or not materially adversely affect
      our business, financial results, financial condition and stock
      prices.

The
      anticipated benefits of combining Jefferson-Pilot and us may not be
      realized.

We
      and

Jefferson

-Pilot
      entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger would
      result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating
      to
      enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for the resulting company
      in
      its businesses, cross-selling opportunities, cost savings and operating
      efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to
      a
      number of uncertainties, including whether we and Jefferson-Pilot are integrated
      in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the
      marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in
      increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion
      of
      management’s time and energy and could materially impact the resulting company’s
      business, financial condition and operating results.

We
      may have difficulty integrating Jefferson-Pilot and may incur substantial costs
      in connection with the integration.

We
      may
      experience material unanticipated difficulties or expenses in connection with
      integrating Jefferson-Pilot, especially given the relatively large size of
      the
      merger. Integrating Jefferson-Pilot with us will be a complex, time-consuming
      and expensive process. Before the merger, we and Jefferson-Pilot operated
      independently, each with its own business, products, customers, employees,
      culture and systems.


We
      may
      face substantial difficulties, costs and delays in integrating Jefferson-Pilot.
      These factors may include:

·

perceived
                adverse changes in product offerings available to clients or client
                service standards, whether or not these changes do, in fact,
                occur;

·

conditions
                imposed by regulators in connection with their decisions whether
                to
                approve the merger;

·

potential
                charges to earnings resulting from the application of purchase accounting
                to the transaction;

·

the
                retention of existing clients, key portfolio managers, sales
                representatives and wholesalers of each company;
                and

·

retaining
                and integrating management and other key employees of the resulting
                company.

After
      the
      merger, we may seek to combine certain operations and functions using common
      information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls
      and human resource practices, including training, professional development
      and
      benefit programs. We may be unsuccessful or delayed in implementing the
      integration of these systems and processes.

Any
      one
      or all of these factors may cause increased operating costs, worse than
      anticipated financial performance or the loss of clients, employees and agents.
      Many of these factors are outside our control.

      the various operating businesses own or lease approximately 2.5 million square
      feet of office space. The governance group for LNC, the Investment Management
      segment, LFD and LFA lease 0.4 million square feet of office space in
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The operating units in the Fort Wayne, Indiana
      area

Legal Proceedings

LNC
      and
      its subsidiaries are involved in various pending or threatened legal
      proceedings, including purported class actions, arising from the conduct of
      business. In some instances, these proceedings include claims for unspecified
      or
      substantial punitive damages and similar types of relief in addition to amounts
      for alleged contractual liability or requests for equitable relief. After
      consultation with legal counsel and a review of available facts, it is
      management’s opinion that these proceedings ultimately will be resolved without
      materially affecting the consolidated financial position of LNC. See Note 9

Of

                in
                connection with the exercise of stock options and related taxes and
                15,754
                shares were withheld for taxes on the vesting of restricted stock.
                For the
                quarter ended December 31, 2005, there were no shares purchased as
                part of

In

                of
                $600 million. In January 2006, our Board of Directors approved a
                $1.6
                billion increase in the share repurchase authorization, bringing
                the total

                in
                connection with this authorization. The amount and timing of share
                repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations,
                the
                generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits
                associated with alternative uses of capital.

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
      and Results of Operations

The
      following is a discussion of the financial condition of Lincoln National
      Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (“LNC” or the “Company” which also
      may be referred to as “we” or “us”) as of December 31, 2005, compared with
      December 31, 2004, and the results of operations of LNC for 2005 and 2004,
      compared with the immediately preceding year. The balance sheet information
      presented below is as of December 31 for each respective year. The statement
      of
      operations information is for the year ended December 31 for each respective
      year.

This
      discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited
      Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented in Item 8
      (“Consolidated Financial Statements”). You should also read our discussion of
“Critical Accounting Policies” beginning on page 40

for an
      explanation of those accounting estimates that we believe are most important
      to
      the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that
      require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.

Forward-Looking

Statements—Cautionary
      Language

Certain
      statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made
      by
      LNC or on LNC’s behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
      the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A
      forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and,
      without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate
      or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words
      like: “believe”, “anticipate”, “expect”, “estimate”, “project”, “will”, “shall”
and other words or phrases with similar meaning. LNC claims the protection
      afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the
      PSLRA.

Forward-looking
      statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to
      differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements.
      Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some
      of which are described within the forward-looking statements include, among
      others:


The
      risks
      included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including
      the
“Risk Factors” beginning on page 24

and
      LNC’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other
      documents filed with the SEC include additional factors which could impact
      LNC’s
      business and financial performance. For risks concerning our previously
      announced merger with Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (“Jefferson-Pilot”), see
      Amendment No. 1 to our Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-130226)

filed
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 9, 2006.
      Moreover, LNC operates in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New
      risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management
      to
      predict all such risk factors.

Further,
      it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on LNC’s business or
      the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual
      results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
      statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place
      undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.
      In addition, LNC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking
      statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of
      this
      report.


INTRODUCTION

LNC
      is a
      holding company, which operates multiple insurance and investment management
      businesses through subsidiary companies. “Lincoln Financial Group” is the
      marketing name for LNC and its subsidiary companies. Operations are divided
      into
      four business segments: 1) Lincoln Retirement, 2) Life Insurance,
      3) Investment Management and 4) Lincoln UK. We also have an “Other
      Operations” category that includes the financial data for the operations of LFA
      and LFD, our retail and wholesale distributors, and for operations that are
      not
      directly related to the business segments, unallocated corporate items (such
      as
      corporate investment income, interest expense on corporate debt and expenses
      not
      allocated to the business segments), and the amortization of the deferred gain
      on the sale of our former reinsurance segment.

Executive
      Summary

We
      view
      our business similar to a columned structure. The base of the structure is
      our
      employees. Overlaying the base is financial and risk management, which is the
      cornerstone of our management and business philosophy. Talented employees and
      strong financial and risk management provide the foundation from which we
      operate and grow our company. With that as a foundation, there are three pillars
      that we focus on—product excellence, power of the brand and distribution reach.

Product
      excellence is one of the pillars of our business. It is important that we
      continually develop and provide products to the marketplace that not only meet
      the needs of our customers and compete effectively, but also satisfy our risk
      profile and meet our profitability standards. Through our business segments,
      we
      provide individual, group, and employer-sponsored variable and fixed annuities,
      individual and corporate-owned life insurance, 401(k) and 403(b) plans, 529
      college savings plans, mutual funds, managed accounts, institutional investment
      and financial planning and advisory services.

Within
      the variable annuity arena, our Lincoln Smart Security

SM

Advantage, with its one and five-year reset feature, experienced significant
      growth during the year, with elections increasing to 55% of deposits for 2005.
      In addition, w

e
      offer a
      patented annuity product feature,

i4LIFE

®

,

which
      we
      introduced a few years ago to meet the needs of baby boomers for retirement
      income as they enter the retirement phase of their life cycle. The

i4LIFE

®

Advantage
      product offers a guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GIB”) rider, which can be
      elected to provide a floor to the amount of income available from the annuity
      during retirement. In 2005, elections of

i4LIFE

®

were
      $1.0 billion, an increase of nearly $600 million over 2004. We believe that
      as
      the baby-boomer generation reaches retirement age it will present an emerging
      opportunity for companies like ours that offer products that allow the
      baby-boomers to better manage their wealth accumulation, retirement income
      and
      wealth transfer needs. We believe that this is a long-term opportunity for
      the
      industry and us.

In
      our
      Life Insurance operation, in 2005, our new variable universal life product
      with
      a lapse protection rider, VUL

ONE

,
      made
      significant gains in the marketplace. We developed this product in response
      to a
      major challenge that we face from continued competitive pressures, especially
      related to life insurance products with secondary guarantees. For products
      with
      lapse protection riders, we remain committed to maintaining appropriate risk
      management and pricing discipline despite the competitive environment. In
      addition, we are seeking capital market solutions in response to new regulations
      requiring increases in statutory reserves for these products.

Our
      mutual fund offerings have had strong performance over the one-, three-, and
      five-year performance periods, resulting in strong deposits and net flows and
      adding to the assets under management for both the retail and institutional
      products lines in our Investment Management segment. Growth in deposits and
      net
      flows also benefited from changes during the year in the management of certain
      asset category offerings. In addition, Lincoln Director

SM

,
      our
      defined contribution retirement product, also contributed to the Investment
      Management segment’s growth in deposits and net flows in 2005.

The
      second pillar of our business is the power of the brand. We believe that name
      recognition and brand awareness among financial intermediaries and their clients
      is a key to our success in the financial services industry. We believe a
      critical factor in differentiating us from our competition is having the
      potential decision makers who buy and sell our product recognize our name and
      brand. In 2005, we spent $31 million to enhance the Lincoln brand.

As
      the
      third pillar, distribution is a very important part of our business. Because
      our
      products are complex and are generally purchased through broker-dealers and
      financial advisors, being able to distribute to these marketing channels is
      one
      key to success in our industry. During 2005, LFD, our wholesaling distribution
      arm, increased account penetration and the number of wholesalers. In fact,
      LFD’s
      top 25 distribution relationships across its wire/regional, financial planner
      and banking channels are responsible for approximately 67% of our sales. LFA,
      our retail distribution arm, had lower sales of proprietary life insurance
      and
      annuities, as well as other investment products, during 2005 due to a decrease
      in the number of planners.


As
      our
      businesses and products are complex, so is the manner in which we derive income.
      We derive our revenues primarily from fees for asset management and mortality
      and expense charges on variable annuity and variable universal life insurance
      account values, cost of insurance (“COI”) charges on life insurance products,
      asset management fees on retail and institutional assets under management,
      premiums on whole life and term life insurance, and investment income on our
      general account assets supporting fixed annuity, term life, whole life,
      universal life and interest-sensitive whole life insurance products. COI charges
      are assessed on the net amount at risk (“NAR”) for investment-oriented life
      insurance products. NAR represents the face amount of insurance in force less
      the reserves to cover death benefits. Deposits and first year premiums in
      current quarters do not have a significant immediate impact on current period
      income from operations, but are an important indicator of future
      profitability.

The
      profitability of our variable annuity and investment management businesses
      is
      dependent upon the level of account values and assets under management from
      which fees are earned. Changes in account values and assets under management
      are
      the result of net flows, the amount of assets deposited with us, net of assets
      returned to or withdrawn by the account owner, and the effect of changes in
      the
      equity markets on the underlying funds. (See the table below for details on
      deposits, net flows and assets under management for 2005, 2004 and 2003.)
      Variable annuity account values are calculated on a daily basis with fees earned
      on those daily balances, rather than end of period values. As a result, point
      to
      point changes in equity market indices do not affect variable annuity fee income
      in the immediate period as much as does the timing of when the changes in the
      equity markets occurred during the period. Changes in the equity markets also
      impact the amount of variable annuity payments for guaranteed benefits, such
      as
      guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal
      benefits (“GMWB”) and GIB as well as the amortization of DAC, PVIF, DSI and
      DFEL.

The
      profitability of our fixed annuity products and life insurance products is
      affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the
      interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited
      to the policyholder. The profitability of the life insurance business depends
      primarily on the size of the in-force block of business, product-pricing
      discipline and underwriting proficiency.

During
      2005, we were successful on several fronts, increasing deposits and net flows,
      improving net income, adding to our product depth and increasing our
      distribution capability. Further, the equity markets, as represented by the
      average daily S&P 500 index returned 6.8% for the full year, contributing to
      the growth in account values from which we collect fees. In addition, the credit
      markets improved in 2005 resulting in significantly less credit related earnings
      charges in 2005 relative to 2004.

Our
      expenses consist of insurance benefits provided, including guaranteed benefits
      on the variable annuity products, interest credited to policyholders on the
      fixed annuity and life insurance products, the costs of selling and servicing
      our products, and general and administrative expenses. Included in the costs
      of
      selling our products is the amortization of DAC, PVIF, DSI and DFEL. Refer
      to
      our “Critical Accounting Policies” below for more information on the
      amortization of DAC, PVIF, DSI and DFEL. In all our businesses, effective
      expense management and our ability to retain assets are important keys to our
      profitability.

In
      October 2005, we announced our agreement to merge with Jefferson-Pilot, subject
      to approval of the shareholders of both companies, regulatory approvals and
      customary closing conditions. We expect to complete this merger in the second
      quarter of 2006. Jefferson-Pilot, through its subsidiaries, offers full lines
      of
      individual life, annuity and investment products, and group life insurance
      products, disability income and dental policies, and it operates television
      and
      radio stations. We believe that Jefferson-Pilot offers a complementary customer
      base, distribution platform and product portfolio.

As
      we
      look ahead to 2006, the announced merger with Jefferson-Pilot provides us with
      new opportunities and challenges. We expect to align the combined business
      to
      enhance our focus on the employer-sponsored retirement market and will realign
      our segments to reflect the new management structure for the employer-sponsored
      and retail markets. A primary goal for 2006 is the timely completion of the
      merger as well as the subsequent successful integration of the two businesses,
      while at the same time maintaining our focus on providing quality products
      and
      expanding our distribution capabilities.

We
      expect
      our major challenges in 2006 to include:


As
      discussed above, key operational measures of our success are deposits, net
      flows
      and assets under management. The table below summarizes these key measures
      by
      business segment over the last three years. These operational measures provide
      information necessary in understanding changes in our revenues and related
      expenses. Deposits are the result of sales of our products and represent money
      put into our products each year. Net flows represent the deposits net of
      withdrawals, payments on death and surrenders. Assets under management include
      our investment securities as well as those assets belonging to third parties
      but
      managed by our businesses. Assets under management also include assets that
      are
      sub-advised by third parties.

In
                September 2004, we completed the sale of our London-based international
                investment management unit (“DIAL”), which had assets under management of
                $22.1 billion at the date of sale. For additional information see
“Results
                of Operations—Investment Management.” Assets under management include
                assets sub-advised for us by unaffiliated parties. Sub-advised assets
                were
                $21.9 billion, or approximately 18%, of the Investment Management
                segment’s assets under management at December 31, 2005, compared to $14.5
                billion, or approximately 14%, at December 31, 2004.

                These
                assets represent our investments, assets held in separate accounts
                and
                assets that we manage or administer for individuals or other companies.
                We

                on
                these assets.

Recent
      Developments

On
      October 9, 2005, we entered into a merger agreement with Jefferson-Pilot, as
      amended on January 26, 2006, pursuant to which Jefferson-Pilot will merge into
      one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Jefferson-Pilot, through its subsidiaries,
      offers full lines of individual life, annuity and investment products, and
      group
      life insurance products, disability income and dental policies, and it operates
      television and radio stations.

Under
      the
      terms of the merger agreement, as amended, Jefferson-Pilot shareholders may
      choose to receive (i) 1.0906 shares of LNC common stock for each of their
      shares, (ii) $55.96 in cash for each of their shares or (iii) a combination
      of
      LNC common stock and cash. Notwithstanding the election, the aggregate amount
      of
      the cash payment to Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will equal $1.8 billion.
      Accordingly, the election of Jefferson-Pilot shareholders may be subject to
      a
      pro-rata adjustment. LNC plans to utilize the existing bridge facility (see
      below) to finance the cash portion of the purchase price at closing and to
      permanently finance the cash portion of the purchase price as soon as
      practicable after closing through a combination of senior and subordinated
      long-term debt or other securities. The transaction, which is subject to the
      approval of shareholders of both companies, regulatory approvals and customary
      closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2006. For
      more
      information regarding this transaction, see Amendment No. 1 to our Form S-4
      (Registration No. 333-130226) filed with the SEC on February 9,
      2006.

In
      October 2005, a purported shareholder class action suit for damages was filed
      in
      state court in North Carolina naming Jefferson-Pilot, most of the individual
      members of its board of directors and LNC as defendants. The complaint alleged
      that certain defendants had breached their fiduciary duties by entering into
      the
      merger agreement. The complaint sought, among other things, unspecified
      compensatory damages. In January 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion to
      voluntarily withdraw the lawsuit, which the court granted without prejudice,
      subject to the restriction that the plaintiffs receive the court’s permission
      before filing any other actions asserting the same claims in North Carolina
      or
      any other jurisdiction. The voluntary dismissal of this action did not involve
      a
      settlement or any compensation being paid or promised to
      plaintiffs.

In
      December 2005, we entered into a bridge facility with a group of banks to
      provide for borrowings of up to $2.3 billion in connection with our merger
      with
      Jefferson-Pilot and planned share repurchase, and in February 2006, we entered
      into a Credit and Letter of Credit Facility with a group of banks to provide
      for
      borrowings and issuances of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of
      $1
      billion. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Liquidity and Cash
      Flow - Financing Activities" for additional information.

Critical
      Accounting
      P

olicies

Given
      the
      nature of our business, our accounting policies require the use of judgments
      relating to a variety of assumptions and estimates. Because of the inherent
      uncertainty in the assumptions and estimates underlying these accounting
      policies under different conditions or assumptions, the amounts reported in
      our
      financial statements could be materially different.

Intangible
      Assets

Accounting
      for intangible assets requires numerous assumptions, such as estimates of
      expected future profitability for our operations and our ability to retain
      existing blocks of life and annuity business in force. Our accounting policies
      for intangible assets impact all four business segments: Lincoln Retirement,
      Life Insurance, Investment Management and Lincoln UK.

Deferred
      Acquisition Costs, Present Value of In-Force, Deferred Sales Inducements and
      Deferred Front-End Loads

Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 97, “Accounting by Insurance
      Companies for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and Realized Gains and Losses
      on
      Investment Sales,” requires that acquisition costs for variable annuity
      contracts, universal and variable universal life insurance policies be amortized
      over the lives of the contracts in relation to the incidence of estimated gross
      profits (“EGPs”) derived from the contracts. Acquisition costs are those costs
      that vary with and are primarily related to new or renewal business. These
      costs
      include commissions and other expenses that vary with new business volume.
      The
      costs that we defer are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet as DAC for
      products


sold
      by
      us or PVIF for books of business acquired by us. In addition, we defer costs
      associated with DSI and revenues associated with DFEL. DFEL is a balance sheet
      liability, and when amortized, increases income.

The
      table
      below presents the balances by business segment as of December 31, 2005.

Note:

The
                above table includes DAC and PVIF amortized in accordance with SFAS
                No.
                60, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises.” Under SFAS No.
                60, acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products, which
                include whole life and term life insurance contracts, are amortized
                over
                periods of 10 to 30 years on either a straight-line basis or as a
                level
                percent of premium of the related policies depending on the block
                of
                business. No DAC is being amortized under SFAS No. 60 for fixed and
                variable payout annuities.

DAC, PVIF,
              DSI and DFEL
              will be referred to hereinafter collectively as DAC.

EGPs
      vary
      based on policy persistency, mortality, fee income, investment margins, expense
      margins and realized gains and losses on investments, including assumptions
      about the expected level of credit-related losses. Each of these sources of
      profit is, in turn, driven by other factors. For example, assets under
      management and the spread between earned and credited rates drive investment
      margins; net amount at risk drives the level of COI charges and reinsurance
      premiums. The level of separate account assets under management is driven by
      changes in the financial markets (equity and bond markets, hereafter referred
      to
      collectively as “equity markets”) and net flows. Realized gains and losses on
      investments include amounts resulting from differences in the actual level
      of
      impairments from the levels assumed in calculating EGPs.

Because
      equity market movements have a significant impact on the value of variable
      annuity and unit-linked accounts, which are contracts written in the U.K.
      similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products, and the fees earned
      on these accounts, EGPs could increase or decrease with movements in the equity
      markets. Significant and sustained changes in equity markets could therefore
      have an impact on DAC amortization for the Lincoln Retirement segment’s variable
      annuity block of business, the Investment Management segment’s annuity-based
      401(k) business and Lincoln UK’s unit-linked business, but have significantly
      less impact on DAC amortization for the Life Insurance segment because
      approximately 81% of their account values pertain to interest-sensitive
      products, such as universal life and interest-sensitive whole life. Our
      assumption for the long-term annual gross growth rate of the equity markets
      used
      in the determination of DAC amortization is 9%, which is reduced by mortality
      and expense charges (“M&E”) and asset management charges.

On
      a
      quarterly basis, we review actual and estimates of future gross profits
      underlying the DAC amortization model and record a positive or negative
      retrospective adjustment to the amount expensed (i.e., unlock DAC, PVIF and
      DSI), or earned (i.e. unlock DFEL). On an annual basis, we review and adjust
      as
      necessary our assumptions for prospective amortization of DAC, PVIF, DSI and
      DFEL. As discussed further below, we completed our 2005 comprehensive review
      of
      assumptions during the quarter ended September 30, 2005.

As
      equity
      markets do not move in a systematic manner, we use a “reversion to the mean”
(“RTM”) process to compute our best estimate long-term gross growth rate
      assumption. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, our application of RTM resulted
      in the use of a higher or lower future gross equity market growth assumption,
      which, together with actual historical gross equity market growth, was expected
      to produce a 9% gross return. The use of a higher or lower future equity market
      growth assumption under RTM tended to mitigate the impact that short-term
      fluctuations in the equity markets have on the estimated EGPs as compared to
      the
      process we followed prior to implementing the RTM process. Until the fourth
      quarter of 2004, our RTM process gave consideration to the effect of short-term
      fluctuations in the equity markets on projected future EGPs. A reversion to
      the
      mean to adjust for historical changes in the equity markets results in a
      positive or negative DAC unlocking.

Beginning
      in the fourth quarter of 2004, we enhanced our RTM process to evaluate the
      carrying value of DAC for our variable annuity, annuity-based 401(k) and
      unit-linked product blocks of business. We changed our RTM process because
      we do
      not believe that random and insignificant short-term fluctuations in equity
      market returns are reflective of the best estimate of future EGPs. We believe
      it
      is larger fluctuations or sustained trends in the equity markets that should
      change our best


estimate
      of future EGPs for these products. This process is not applied to our life
      insurance and fixed annuity businesses, as equity market performance does not
      have a significant impact on these products. Under our enhanced RTM process,
      on
      each valuation date, future EGPs are projected using stochastic modeling of
      a
      large number of future equity market scenarios in conjunction with best
      estimates of lapse rates, interest margins and mortality to develop a
      statistical distribution of the present value of future EGPs for each of the
      blocks of business. Because future equity market returns are impossible to
      predict, the underlying premise of this process is that best estimate
      projections of future EGPs, as required by SFAS No. 97, need not be affected
      by
      random short-term and insignificant deviations from expectations in equity
      market returns. However, long-term or significant deviations from expected
      equity market returns will require a change to best estimate projections of
      EGPs
      and prospective unlocking of DAC. The statistical distribution is designed
      to
      identify when the equity market return deviations from expected returns have
      become significant enough to warrant a change of the future equity return EGP
      assumption.

The
      stochastic modeling performed for our variable annuity blocks of business as
      described above is used to develop a range of reasonably possible future EGPs.
      We compare the range of the present value of the future EGPs from the stochastic
      modeling to that used in the DAC amortization model. A set of intervals around
      the mean of these scenarios is utilized to calculate two separate statistical
      ranges of reasonably possible EGPs. These intervals are compared to the present
      value of the EGPs used in the DAC amortization model. If the present value
      of
      EGP assumptions utilized in the DAC amortization model were to exceed the margin
      of the reasonable range of statistically calculated EGPs, a revision of the
      EGPs
      used to calculate DAC amortization would occur. If a revision is deemed
      necessary, future EGPs would be re-projected using the current account values
      at
      the end of the period during which the revision occurred along with a revised
      long-term annual equity market gross return assumption such that the
      re-projected EGPs would be our best estimate of EGPs.

Notwithstanding
      these intervals, if a severe decline or advance in equity markets were to occur
      or should other circumstances, including policyholder activity, suggest that
      the
      present value of future EGPs no longer represents our best estimate, we could
      determine that a revision of the EGPs is necessary. A severe decline or advance
      in equity markets would involve a sustained change from December 31, 2005
      levels.

Our
      practice is not necessarily to unlock immediately after exceeding the first
      of
      the two statistical ranges, but rather if we stay between the first and second
      statistical range for several quarters, we would likely unlock. Additionally,
      if
      we exceed the ranges as a result of a short-term market reaction, such as we
      saw
      after the events of September 11, 2001, we would not necessarily unlock.
      However, if the second statistical range is exceeded for more than one quarter,
      it is likely that we would unlock. While this approach reduces adjustments
      to
      DAC due to short-term equity market fluctuations, significant changes in the
      equity markets that extend beyond one or two quarters could result in a
      significant positive or negative unlocking.

Our
      long-term equity market growth assumption rate is 9%, which is used in the
      determination of DAC amortization for the variable component of our variable
      annuity products, as this component is primarily equity related. Under the
      enhanced RTM methodology, we take into account the market performance on the
      business that was in force when the enhanced RTM methodology was put in effect
      using the RTM process previously used. For the Lincoln Retirement business
      issued in years prior to 2005, the assumed annual variable appreciation rate
      is
      5.11% as of December 31, 2005. It remains 5.11% for the subsequent 33-month
      period and is then 9% thereafter. The variable appreciation rate is before
      deducting for our fees. For business issued in 2005, the assumed annual variable
      appreciation rate and the long-term growth rate are 9%. The actual variable
      appreciation rate since the date of enhanced RTM implementation has been better
      than the assumed rate. As a result, we are more likely to unlock DAC from
      positive variable performance rather than from negative returns from December
      31, 2005. Given where our best estimate of EGPs for the Lincoln Retirement
      segment was positioned in the range at December 31, 2005, if we were to reset
      the RTM to a 9% long-term gross equity market growth assumption from December
      31, 2005, it would result in a cumulative positive DAC unlocking of
      approximately $114 million pre-tax ($74 million after-tax). To further
      illustrate the position in the range of our best estimate of EGPs at December
      31, 2005 for the Lincoln Retirement segment, an immediate equity market movement
      of positive 10% would bring us to the first of the two statistical ranges while
      an immediate movement of positive 30% would bring us to the second of the two
      ranges for the Lincoln Retirement segment. Subsequent equity market performance
      that would keep us at or move us beyond the first statistical range would likely
      result in positive unlocking. Negative equity market performance would have
      to
      be significantly greater than the above percentages for us to exceed the lower
      end of the two statistical ranges.

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets.

Under
      SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, goodwill and intangible
      assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment
      tests conducted at least annually. Intangibles that do not have indefinite
      lives
      are amortized over their estimated useful lives.


The
      valuation techniques we use to estimate the fair value of the group of assets
      comprising the different reporting units varies based on the characteristics
      of
      each reporting unit’s business and operations. A market-based valuation
      technique that focuses on price-to-earnings (“P/E”) multiplier and the
      segment-level operating income is used for the Lincoln Retirement and Life
      Insurance reporting units. For the Lincoln UK segment, a discounted cash flow
      model is utilized to determine the fair value. A valuation technique combining
      multiples of revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
      amortization and assets under management is used to assess the goodwill in
      our
      Investment Management segment. We use October 1 as the annual review date for
      impairment. As such, we performed valuation reviews during the fourth quarter
      of
      2005, 2004, and 2003. The results of the tests performed as of October 1, 2005,
      2004 and 2003 indicated that we did not have impaired goodwill. The valuation
      techniques used for the Lincoln UK and the Investment Management segments are
      consistent with the methods used in previous periods.

Investments

Our
      primary investments are in fixed maturity securities, including corporate and
      government bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities and redeemable preferred
      stock, and equity securities, mortgage loans and policy loans. All our fixed
      maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale as defined
      in SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
      Securities,” except for those securities supporting certain reinsurance
      transactions which are classified as trading securities. Available-for-sale
      securities are carried at fair value with the difference from amortized cost
      included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
      comprehensive income. The difference is net of related DAC and amounts that
      would be credited to policyholders, if realized, and taxes.

Fair
      values for fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices, where
      available. For fixed maturity securities that are not actively traded, fair
      values are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services.
      The fair values for equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Fair
      values for private securities are estimated by (1) a matrix process that employs
      discounting expected future cash flows using a current market rate applicable
      to
      the coupon rate, credit quality, industry sector and maturity of the
      investments; (2) third party-supplied prices or secondary market transactions;
      and (3) applying professional judgment to arrive at the fair value based upon
      prices of public or non-public securities of similarly situated issuers.

Write-Downs
      for Other-Than Temporary Impairments and Allowance for Losses

Determining
      whether a decline in current fair values is other than a temporary decline
      in
      value for securities classified as available-for-sale and trading can frequently
      involve a variety of assumptions and estimates, particularly for investments
      that are not actively traded on established markets. For instance, assessing
      the
      value of some investments requires an analysis of expected future cash flows.
      Some investment structures, such as collateralized debt obligations, often
      represent selected levels, or tranches collateralized by underlying investments
      in a wide variety of underlying issuers and security types.

Factors
      we consider in determining whether declines in the fair value of fixed maturity
      securities are other than temporary include 1) the significance of the decline;
      2) our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient period
      of
      time for it to recover to an amount at least equal to its carrying value; 3)
      the
      time period during which there has been a significant decline in value; and
      4)
      fundamental analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial
      condition of the issuer. Based upon these factors, securities that have
      indications of potential impairment are subject to intensive review. Where
      such
      analysis results in a conclusion that declines in fair values are other than
      temporary, the security is written down to fair value. The fixed maturity
      securities to which these write-downs apply were generally of investment grade
      at the time of purchase, but were subsequently downgraded by rating agencies
      to
“below-investment grade.” See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
      for a general discussion of the methodologies and assumptions used to determine
      estimated fair values.

For
      certain securitized fixed maturity securities with contractual cash flows,
      including asset-backed securities, we use our best estimate of cash flows for
      the life of the security to determine whether there is an other-than-temporary
      impairment of the security as required under Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
      Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and
      Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets,” and we review
      for other indicators of impairment as required by EITF 03-1, “The Meaning of
      Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
      Investments.”

Based
      on
      our evaluation of securities with an unrealized loss at December 31, 2005,
      we do
      not believe that any additional other-than-temporary-impairment losses, other
      than those already reflected in the financial statements, are necessary at
      the
      Balance Sheet date. At December 31, 2005, there were available-for-sale
      securities with unrealized losses totaling $312.9 million pre-tax, and prior
      to
      the impact on DAC.


As
      the
      discussion above indicates, there are risks and uncertainties associated with
      determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than
      temporary. These include subsequent significant changes in general overall
      economic conditions, as well as specific business conditions affecting
      particular issuers, future financial market effects such as interest rate
      spreads, stability of foreign governments and economies, future rating agency
      actions and significant accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that
      may adversely affect certain investments. In addition, there are often
      significant estimates and assumptions that we use to estimate the fair values
      of
      securities, including projections of expected future cash flows and pricing
      of
      private securities. We continually monitor developments and update underlying
      assumptions and financial models based upon new information.

Write-downs
      and allowances for losses on select mortgage loans on real estate, real estate
      and other investments are established when the underlying value of the property
      is deemed to be less than the carrying value. All mortgage loans that are
      impaired have an established allowance for credit loss. Changing economic
      conditions impact our valuation of mortgage loans. Increasing vacancies,
      declining rents and the like are incorporated into the discounted cash flow
      analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the
      establishment of (or an increase in) an allowance for credit losses. In
      addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio
      to identify risk. Areas of current emphasis are the hotel mortgage loan
      portfolio and retail, office and industrial properties that have deteriorating
      credits or have experienced debt coverage reduction. Where warranted, we have
      established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis.

Derivatives

To
      protect us from a variety of equity market and interest rate risks that are
      inherent in many of our life insurance and annuity products, we use various
      derivative instruments. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs
      and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve
      a
      variety of assumptions and estimates. We use derivatives to hedge equity market
      risks, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures that are embedded
      in
      our annuity and life insurance product liabilities or investment portfolios.
      Derivatives held at December 31, 2005 contain industry standard terms and are
      entered into with financial institutions with long-standing, superior
      performance records. Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential
      impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Item
      7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” See Note 9 to
      the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our
      accounting for derivatives.

Insurance
      and Investment Contract Obligations

Reserves

Establishing
      adequate liabilities for our obligations to policyholders requires assumptions
      to be made regarding mortality and morbidity. The applicable insurance laws
      under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as
      liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding
      policies. These reserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums
      to
      be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates,
      are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract
      obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall not
      be
      less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity
      tables, interest rates, and methods of valuation.

The
      reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated
      in
      accordance with GAAP and differ from those specified by the laws of the various
      states and carried in the statutory financial statements of the life insurance
      subsidiaries. These differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity
      tables, interest, persistency and other assumptions which are believed to be
      more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those
      required for statutory accounting purposes and from differences in actuarial
      reserving methods. For example, in October 2005, the National Association of
      Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") adopted a change to Actuarial Guideline 38
      (also known as "AXXX"), the statutory reserve requirements for UL products
      with
      secondary guarantees, such as Lincoln National Life’s lapse protection rider
      ("LPR"), which impacts such business written after the effective date of July
      1,
      2005. There was no impact to GAAP reserves or results of operations as a result
      of Actuarial Guideline 38.

The
      assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation
      of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual
      experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves should
      be
      adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is worse
      than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required. This would result
      in
      a charge to our net income during the period the increase in reserves occurred.
      The key


experience
      assumptions include mortality rates, policy persistency and interest rates.
      We
      periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues
      and reserve for all claims incurred, as we believe appropriate.

Guaranteed
      Minimum Benefits

We
      currently offer minimum guarantee features with certain variable annuity
      products, which include various types of GMDB features, a GMWB feature and
      a GIB
      feature. Within the Lincoln Retirement segment, we hold liabilities for the
      reserves related to these guarantee features. A key assumption affecting the
      accounting for these guaranteed annuity benefits is the performance of equity
      markets. Effective January 1, 2004, the accounting for GMDB reserves changed
      as
      a result of new guidance affecting the accounting for guaranteed benefits.
      See
      Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
      GMWB
      benefits are considered to be embedded derivatives under SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended,
      resulting in the related liabilities being separated from the host insurance
      product and recognized at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in
      earnings.

The
      Lincoln Retirement segment has a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the
      risk
      and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets,
      interest rates, and volatility associated with the Lincoln Smart
      Security

SM

Advantage GMWB and our various GMDB features. The hedging strategy is designed
      such that changes in the value of the hedge contracts move in the opposite
      direction of changes in the value of the embedded derivative of the GMWB or
      changes in the reserve for GMDB contracts subject to the hedging strategy.

Account
      balances covered in this hedging program combined with account balances for
      which there is no death benefit represent approximately 94% of total variable
      annuity account balances, which excludes the Alliance mutual fund business.
      Currently, there is no hedging strategy for the GIB feature, as less than 3%
      of
      variable annuity account balances are subject to the feature and substantially
      all of the outstanding contracts are still in the accumulation
      phase.

The
      reserves related to the GMDB are based on the application of a benefit ratio
      to
      total assessments related to the variable annuity. The level and direction
      of
      the change in reserves will vary over time based on the emergence of the benefit
      ratio (which is based on both historical and projected future level of benefits)
      and the level of assessments (both historical and projected) associated with
      the
      variable annuity. We utilize a delta hedging strategy for variable annuity
      products with a GMDB feature, which uses futures on U.S.-based equity market
      indices to hedge against movements in equity markets. Because the GMDB reserves
      are based upon projected long-term equity market return assumptions, and since
      the value of the hedging contracts will reflect current capital market
      conditions, the quarterly changes in values for the GMDB reserves and the
      hedging contracts may not offset each other on an exact basis. Despite these
      short-term fluctuations in values, we intend to continue to hedge our long-term
      GMDB exposure in order to mitigate the risk associated with falling equity
      markets. During 2004, we expanded our hedging program to cover substantially
      all
      exposures for these policies.

We
      utilize a dynamic hedging strategy for variable annuity products with a GMWB
      feature, which uses futures on U.S.-based equity indices to hedge against
      movements in the equity markets, as well as interest rate and equity derivative
      securities to hedge against changes in reserves associated with changes in
      interest rates and market implied volatilities. As of December 31, 2005, the
      notional amounts of the underlying hedge instruments are such that the magnitude
      of the change in the value of the hedge instruments due to changes in equity
      markets, interest rates, and implied volatilities is designed to offset the
      magnitude of the change in the fair value of the GMWB guarantee caused by those
      same factors. At December 31, 2005, the embedded derivative for GMWB was a
      liability valued at $5.9 million. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, we only
      hedged against movements in the equity markets, but as a result of strong flows
      and current and possible future product enhancements, we expanded our hedging
      program in the fourth quarter of 2004 to cover movements in interest rates
      and
      implied volatilities. As part of our current hedging program, policyholder
      behavior and equity, interest rate, and volatility market conditions are
      monitored on a daily basis. We rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes
      in these factors as needed. While we actively manage our hedge positions, our
      hedge positions may not be totally effective to offset changes in assets and
      liabilities caused by movements in these factors due to, among other things,
      differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding
      changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets and
      interest rates, market volatility, policyholder behavior, divergence between
      the
      performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between
      the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments, or our ability
      to
      purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and
      return trade-off. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
      additional information on our reserves for guaranteed benefits.


Deferred
      Gain on Sale of the Reinsurance Segment

In
      2001,
      we sold our reinsurance operation to Swiss Re. The transaction involved a series
      of indemnity reinsurance transactions combined with the sale of certain stock
      companies that comprised our reinsurance operation. The gain related to the
      indemnity reinsurance transactions was recorded as deferred gain in the
      liability section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with the
      requirements of SFAS No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of
      Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts” (“SFAS 113”). The deferred gain is
      being amortized into income at the rate that earnings on the reinsured business
      are expected to emerge, over a period of 15 years. In addition, because we
      have
      not been relieved of our legal liabilities to the underlying ceding companies
      with respect to the portion of the business indemnity reinsured by Swiss Re,
      under SFAS 113 the reserves for the underlying reinsurance contracts as well
      as
      a corresponding reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re will continue to be
      carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet during the run-off period of the
      underlying reinsurance business. This is particularly relevant in the case
      of
      the exited personal accident reinsurance lines of business where the underlying
      reserves are based upon various estimates that are subject to considerable
      uncertainty.

Because
      of ongoing uncertainty related to personal accident business, the reserves
      related to these exited business lines carried on our Consolidated Balance
      Sheet
      at December 31, 2005 may ultimately prove to be either excessive or deficient.
      For instance, in the event that future developments indicate that these reserves
      should be increased, we would record a current period non-cash charge to record
      the increase in reserves. Because Swiss Re is responsible for paying the
      underlying claims to the ceding companies, we would record a corresponding
      increase in reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re. However, SFAS 113 does not
      permit us to take the full benefit in earnings for the recording of the increase
      in the reinsurance recoverable in the period of the change. Rather, we would
      increase the deferred gain recognized upon the closing of the indemnity
      reinsurance transaction with Swiss Re and would report a cumulative amortization
      “catch-up” adjustment to the deferred gain balance as increased earnings
      recognized in the period of change. Any amount of additional increase to the
      deferred gain above the cumulative amortization “catch-up” adjustment must
      continue to be deferred and will be amortized into income in future periods
      over
      the remaining period of expected run-off of the underlying business. No cash
      would be transferred between Swiss Re and us as a result of these developments.

Pension
      and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Pursuant
      to the accounting rules for our obligations to employees under our various
      pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we are required to make a number
      of assumptions to estimate related liabilities and expenses. We use assumptions
      for the weighted-average discount rate, expected return on plan assets and
      a
      salary increase assumption to estimate pension expense. The discount rate
      assumptions are determined using an analysis of current market information
      and
      the projected benefit flows associated with these plans. The analysis is
      provided by our pension plan actuaries. The expected long-term rate of return
      on
      plan assets is initially established at the beginning of the plan year based
      on
      historical and projected future rates of return and is the average rate of
      earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested in the plan. The
      calculation of our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation also uses
      an
      assumption of weighted-average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
      of
      covered benefits, which reflects a health care cost trend rate. If we increased
      the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point each year,
      the
      accumulated post-retirement benefits obligation would increase by $8.3 million
      as of December 31, 2005. For more information on our accounting for employee
      benefit plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Equity
      Market Guidance

With
      the
      adoption of our enhanced RTM process in 2004 and the expansion of our hedging
      strategy as described in “Critical Accounting Policies” above, we expect that in
      general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a
      significant impact on our quarterly earnings due to unlocking of assumptions
      for
      DAC/PVIF/DSI/DFEL. However, there is an impact to earnings from the affects
      of
      equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the
      related fees we earn on those assets. The table below presents our estimate
      of
      the annual after-tax impact on fees on account values and assets under
      management, after the associated DAC amortization, from a 1% change in the
      equity markets.

*
      The
      Investment Management segment manages equity assets of varying styles (growth,
      value, blend, international) and underlying products (mutual funds,
      institutional accounts, insurance separate accounts, etc.). No single equity
      benchmark will accurately predict the change in fee revenue for this segment.
      The annual effect on fees noted above is based on a 1% increase in overall
      Investment Management equity assets.

The
      fee
      income factors represent an expected annual effect. The result of the above
      factor should be multiplied by 25% to arrive at an estimated quarterly effect.
      The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues will not be
      fully recognized in the current quarter due to the fact that fee revenues are
      earned based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the
      current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of
      period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent
      periods.

This
      discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility
      on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended
      to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors,
      many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors
      that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable or
      fixed annuity contracts, switching between investment alternatives available
      within variable products, or changes in policy lapse rates.

For
      purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate
      with the change in the relevant index. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and
      Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Market Risk Exposures of Financial
      Instruments—3) Equity Market Exposures—Fee Revenues” of this Form 10-K for
      additional information of the effect of equity markets on fee revenues.

Consolidated
      Results

The table below provides a detailed comparison of items
        included within net realized investment gains (losses) in the table
        above:


Comparison
      of 2005 to 2004

Revenues

The
      increase in insurance fees and investment advisory fees in 2005 primarily
      reflects growth in deposits and assets under management, and to a lesser extent,
      the effects of favorable equity market performance. Assets under management
      increased 19% at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 as a result
      of
      positive net flows and increases in equity markets. The average level of the
      equity markets was higher in 2005, compared to 2004, resulting in higher fee
      income for the Lincoln Retirement segment. Excluding the impact of dividends,
      the S&P 500 index increased 3.0% and the average daily S&P index
      increased 6.8% in 2005, compared to 2004.

Net
      realized investment losses for 2005 declined $40.7 million compared to 2004
      due
      to lower impairment losses. See the “Consolidated Investments” section below for
      additional information on our investment performance.

Revenues
      for 2005 include a gain on sale of subsidiaries of $14.2 million pre-tax ($9.3
      million after-tax) from an agreement to settle in full the residual contingent
      payments resulting from the arrangement to outsource Lincoln UK’s policy and
      administration functions to Capita Life and Pensions Services Limited, a
      subsidiary of Capita Group Plc (“Capita”). Revenues for 2004 included a gain of
      $110.8 million pre-tax ($46.1 million after-tax) from the sale of DIAL. See
      “Investment Management” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below, and Note 13
      to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The gain
      on
      the sale of subsidiaries for 2004 also included a $10.1 million pre-tax gain
      on
      the exercise of a put option arising from the Capita arrangement (see Note
      7 to
      the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2004 Form 10-K for additional
      information) and $14.1 million from the sale of LFA’s employee benefits
      marketing business.

Net
      investment income for 2005 was level with the same 2004 periods. A decrease
      in
      commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums of $43.8 million
      and declining portfolio yields substantially offset the favorable effects of
      asset growth from net flows.

Expenses

Consolidated
      expenses increased 2% in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting higher expenses
      in
      the Lincoln Retirement, Life Insurance and Investment Management business
      segments. The increases resulted primarily from growth in our businesses,
      partially offset by the effect of spread management through lower crediting
      rates on interest-sensitive business and movements from fixed to variable
      annuity products. See “Results of Operations by Segment” below for further
      discussion by segment.

Consolidated
      expenses for 2005 included a net reduction of $41.6 million pre-tax for the
      effect of net positive unlocking resulting from the third quarter 2005 annual
      comprehensive review of the assumptions underlying the amortization of DAC,
      PVIF, DSI and DFEL as well as the reserves related to GMDB and the embedded
      derivative related to GMWB, which compares with a net reduction of $14.8 million
      pre-tax for 2004. The impact of unlocking varied by segment. The factors
      impacting the unlocking are discussed further in respective segment discussions
      below.

Restructuring
      charges were $29.5 million pre-tax ($19.1 million after-tax) in 2005 compared
      to
      $21.4 million pre-tax ($13.9 million after-tax) for 2004, resulting from expense
      initiatives undertaken by us during 2003 to improve operational efficiencies
      and
      costs associated with LFA's 2005 plan to realign its field management and
      financial planning support areas. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial
      Statements for additional information on restructuring charges.

Federal
      income tax expense included a benefit of $46.8 million in 2005 compared to
      $4.4
      million in 2004, related to the release of the deferred tax valuation allowance
      in our Barbados reinsurance company. This reduction is included in Other
      Operations.

Comparison
      of 2004 to 2003

Revenues

The
      increase in insurance fees and investment advisory fees in 2004 primarily
      reflects the effects of favorable equity market performance, growth in deposits
      and assets under management. The average level of the equity markets was higher
      in 2004 compared to 2003 resulting in higher fee income for the Lincoln
      Retirement segment. Excluding dividends, the S&P 500 index increased 9% and
      average daily S&P index increased 17% in 2004.


Revenues
      related to insurance fees and investment advisory fees in 2004 increased
      significantly compared to 2003. Key drivers of 2004 results were the favorable
      performance of the equity markets, growth in deposits and net flows, all of
      which resulted in higher account values and assets under management. The growth
      in deposits in our segments was the result of product development, expanded
      wholesaling, and strong investment performance.

Net
      realized losses on investments were $43.1 million higher in 2004 than 2003,
      excluding the $371.5 million positive impact of the adoption of FASB Derivative
      Implementation Group Statement No. 133 Implementation Issue No. B36 (“DIG B36”)
      in 2003 as discussed in “Accounting Pronouncements—Accounting for Modified
      Coinsurance” below. Although the improvement in the credit markets in 2004
      resulted in less write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments of
      available-for-sale securities, we also realized less gains from the sale of
      securities and had a larger negative impact from DAC. Additional details on
      our
      investment performance are provided in the “Consolidated Investments” section
      below.

Revenues
      from the sale of subsidiaries/businesses in 2004 included pre-tax gains of
      $110.8 million ($46.1 million after tax) from the sale of DIAL, $14.1 million
      related to the sale of LFA’s employee benefits marketing business, and $10.1
      million from the exercise of a put option arising from the Capita
      arrangement.

The
      increase in net investment income in 2004 compared to 2003 included additional
      commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums of approximately
      $77 million and the receipt of approximately $21.9 million of contingent
      interest on mortgage loans on real estate previously owned by us. Net investment
      income during 2003 was affected by declining portfolio yields, which offset
      the
      favorable effect of asset growth from net flows.

Expenses

Consolidated
      expenses for 2004 increased $99.2 million, or 2%, compared to 2003. Expenses
      were higher in all four business segments. See “Results of Operations by
      Segment” below for further discussion by segment. The increase resulted from
      growth in our business partially offset by the effect of spread management
      through lower crediting rates on interest-sensitive business, movements from
      fixed to variable annuity products, and a reduction in the level of GMDB
      benefits. In addition, expenses were higher from the amortization, including
      unlocking, of DAC, PVIF, DSI and DFEL on a consolidated basis. The impact varied
      by segment. The factors impacting the unlocking are discussed further in the
      respective segment discussions below.

Further,
      in 2003, we recorded charges for reserve increases on the business sold to
      Swiss
      Re. Accordingly, 2003 expenses included $32.1 million related to charges
      required by SFAS 113 on increases in reserves for business sold through
      indemnity reinsurance to Swiss Re. The accounting for these charges and the
      effect on our results in the future is more fully described in the “Critical
      Accounting Policy—Deferred Gain on the Sale of the Reinsurance Segment” section
      above.

Restructuring
      charges of $21.4 million pre-tax ($13.9 million after tax) and $53.8 million
      pre-tax ($35.0 million after-tax) in 2004 and 2003, respectively, were the
      result of expense initiatives undertaken by us during 2003 to improve
      operational efficiencies. For additional information on restructuring charges
      see “Restructuring Activities” below.

Federal
      income tax expense for 2004 included a $4.4 million reduction related to a
      partial release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in our Barbados insurance
      company. This reduction is included in Other Operations. In 2003, we recorded
      a
      tax benefit of $10.1 million resulting from a change in the tax laws in the
      United Kingdom permitting a deduction for stock compensation expense. The tax
      benefit recorded in 2003 reflected a deduction for the fair value of options
      granted in 2003 and prior years.


RESULTS
      OF OPERATIONS

BY
      SEGMENT

In
      this
      MD&A, in addition to providing consolidated net income (loss), we also
      provide segment operating revenue and income (loss) from operations because
      we
      believe they are meaningful measures of revenue and the profit or loss generated
      by our operating segments. Operating revenue is GAAP revenue excluding realized
      gains and losses on investments and derivative instruments, gains and losses
      on
      reinsurance embedded derivative/trading securities, gains and losses on sale
      of
      subsidiaries/businesses and the amortization of deferred gain arising from
      reserve development on business sold through reinsurance. Income (loss) from
      operations is GAAP net income (loss) excluding net realized investment gains
      and
      losses, losses on early retirement of debt, restructuring charges, reserve
      development net of related amortization on business sold through reinsurance
      and
      cumulative effect of accounting changes. Operating revenue and income (loss)
      from operations are the financial performance measures used by our management
      and Board of Directors to evaluate and assess the results of our segments.
      Accordingly, we report income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 11
      to
      the Consolidated Financial Statements as required by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures
      About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” Our management and
      Board of Directors believe that income (loss) from operations explains the
      results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better
      understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because net
      realized investment gains and losses, restructuring charges, reserve development
      net of related amortization on business sold through reinsurance and cumulative
      effect of accounting changes are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative
      of
      current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments,
      and in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate
      to the operations of the individual segments. Income (loss) from operations
      does
      not replace net income (loss) as the GAAP measure of our consolidated results
      of
      operations.

Following
      is a reconciliation of our segment operating revenue and income from operations
      to our consolidated revenue and net income:

                respectively; gain on transfer of securities from available-for-sale
                to
                trading of $241.5 million for 2003; gain (loss) on reinsurance embedded

Comparison
      of 2005 to 2004

Revenues

Insurance
      fees increased in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of increases in average
      daily variable annuity account values. The increase in account values reflects
      cumulative positive net flows and improvement in the equity markets between
      periods. The average S&P 500 Index was 6.8% higher in 2005, compared to
      2004. Variable product sales were up 20% for 2005 over 2004 while fixed product
      sales were down 34% from the same periods in the previous year. Through the
      fourth quarter of 2005, the Lincoln Retirement segment has experienced 18
      consecutive quarters of positive net flows.

New
      deposits are an important component of our effort to grow the annuity business.
      Although deposits do not significantly impact current quarter income from
      operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. In the
      past
      several years, we have concentrated our efforts on both product and distribution
      breadth. Annuity deposits increased 13% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily
      due
      to growth in individual variable annuity business.


The
      growth in individual variable annuity deposits was a result of continued strong
      sales of the Lincoln Smart Security

SM

Advantage feature available in our variable annuity products and expansion
      of
      the wholesaling force in LFD during the last year. Variable annuity gross
      deposits in our Lincoln ChoicePlus

SM

and
      American Legacy products were up 25% for 2005 to $7.4 billion, compared to
      $5.9
      billion for 2004.

Individual
      fixed annuity deposits declined in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the
      continued low long-term interest rate environment. We approached the fixed
      annuity marketplace on an opportunistic basis throughout 2004 and 2005,
      generally offering rates that are consistent with our required spreads. In
      the
      current interest rate environment, we expect this trend of lower fixed annuity
      deposits to continue.

Significant
      deposit growth in the employer-sponsored business has come through our Alliance
      program. The Alliance program bundles our fixed annuity products with mutual
      funds, along with recordkeeping and employee education components. We earn
      fees
      for the services we provide to mutual fund accounts and investment margins
      on
      fixed annuities of Alliance program accounts. Alliance program deposits were
      $1.5 billion (including Alliance program fixed annuity deposits) in 2005, up
      20%
      from 2004. The amounts associated with the Alliance mutual fund program are
      not
      included in the separate accounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
      Deposits in our traditional annuity products in the employer-sponsored business
      in 2005 were unchanged compared to 2004.

The
      other
      component of net flows is retention of the business. One of the key assumptions
      in pricing a product is the account persistency, often referred to as the lapse
      rate. The lapse rate compares the amount of withdrawals to the retained account
      values. One way to measure a company’s success in retaining assets is to look at
      the overall level of withdrawals from period to period. Additionally, by
      comparing actual lapse rates to the rates expected in designing the annuity
      product, it is possible to gauge the impact of persistency on profitability.
      Overall lapse rates were 9.1% for 2005 compared to 8.9% for 2004. Overall lapse
      rates have been more favorable than the level of persistency assumed in product
      pricing, which is reflected in the favorable prospective DAC unlocking from
      the
      third quarter 2005 comprehensive assumption review discussed below. The
      persistency of the employer-sponsored business tends to be higher than in the
      individual annuity marketplace as employer-sponsored products involve systematic
      deposits and are part of an overall employee benefit plan which is generally
      not
      subject to the level of exchange activity typically experienced in the
      individual marketplace.

Net
      investment income decreased $32.0 million for 2005 compared to 2004. Net
      investment income for 2005 includes the second quarter receipt of $19.3 million
      of fees for standby real estate equity commitments. The decline in net
      investment income in 2005 was due to lower fixed annuity account values and
      lower investment portfolio rates in 2005, lower commercial mortgage loan
      prepayment and bond makewhole premiums, and $13.0 million of contingent interest
      income received in 2004. Net investment income included $16.4 million from
      commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums for 2005
      compared to $41.0 million of prepayment premiums for 2004.

When
      analyzing the impact of net investment income, it is important to understand
      that a portion of the investment income earned is credited to the policyholders
      of our fixed annuity products. The interest credited to policyholders is
      included in the segment’s expenses. Annuity product interest rate margins
      represent the excess of the yield on earning assets over the average crediting
      rate. The yield on earning assets is calculated as net investment income on
      fixed product investment portfolios divided by average earning assets. The
      average crediting rate is calculated using interest credited on annuity products
      less bonus credits and excess interest on policies with the dollar cost
      averaging feature, divided by the average fixed account values net of coinsured
      account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance
      agreements are included in account values for this calculation. As a result
      of
      crediting rate actions we took in 2003 through 2005, interest credited to
      policyholder balances decreased for 2005 compared to 2004.

The
      interest rate margin table above summarizes the effect of changes in the
      portfolio yield, the rate credited to policyholders, as well as the impact
      of
      contingent interest and prepayment premiums on the segment’s results on an
      after-DAC, after-tax basis. Although the net investment income yield declined
      year over year, we were able to reduce crediting rates to substantially offset
      this decrease. The interest rate margin declined to 2.26% for 2005 from 2.36%
      for 2004. After removing the effects of the contingent interest and prepayment
      premiums, the interest rate margin improved to 2.18 % for 2005, compared to
      2.10% for 2004. We expect a reduction in interest rate margins 2006 of
      approximately 2 to 3 basis points per quarter. Our expectation includes the
      assumptions that there is a 50 basis point annual improvement in new money
      investment rates, that there are no significant changes in net flows in or
      out
      of our fixed accounts, or other changes which may cause interest rate margins
      to
      differ from our expectation. For information on interest rate margins and the
      interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 7A - Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of this Form 10-K.


Expenses

Insurance
      benefits include interest credited to policyholders, which decreased to $819
      million in 2005 compared to $836 million in 2004, as a result of actions taken
      to lower crediting rates commensurate with the reduction in the overall
      investment yield. See the table above for the interest rate credited to
      policyholders. Also included in insurance benefits are the costs associated
      with
      guaranteed benefits included within variable annuities with the GMDB, GMWB
      or
      GIB riders. The effect of changes in net reserve and benefit payments during
      2005 attributable to these guaranteed benefits was partially offset by the
      favorable results of the expanded hedge program implemented during 2004 such
      that the period over period variances on an after-DAC and after-tax basis was
      $4.6 million.

In
      the
      third quarter of 2005, we completed our annual comprehensive review of the
      assumptions underlying the prospective amortization of DAC, PVIF and DSI, and
      the calculations of the GMDB reserves and the embedded derivative related to
      GMWB. This review resulted in a favorable unlocking adjustment due to continued
      favorable lapse rates partially offset by mortality. The result of this
      prospective unlocking was a reduction in expenses of $50.7 million pre-tax
      ($33.0 million after-tax). The comprehensive review completed during the third
      quarter of 2005 also resulted in a reduction in amortization expense of
      approximately $4.5 million pre-tax ($3.0 million after-tax) per
      quarter.

Our
      annual comprehensive review of the assumptions underlying the prospective
      amortization of DAC, PVIF and DSI, and the calculation of the GMDB reserves
      in
      2004 resulted in a favorable unlocking adjustment due to continued favorable
      contract retention and modeling refinements offset by spread compression. For
      2004, the result of this prospective unlocking was a reduction in expenses
      of
      $32.3 million pre-tax ($21.0 million after-tax).

At
      December 31, 2005, Lincoln Retirement’s NAR related to contracts with a GMDB
      feature was $0.5 billion. The related GAAP and statutory reserves were $14.8
      million and $42.9 million, respectively. The comparable amounts at December
      31,
      2004 were a NAR of $0.8 billion, GAAP reserves of $18.2 million and statutory
      reserves of $46.4 million. At any point in time, the NAR is the difference
      between the potential death benefit payable and the total account value, with
      a
      floor of zero (when account values exceed the potential death benefit there
      is
      no amount at risk). Accordingly, the NAR represents the maximum amount Lincoln
      Retirement would have to pay if all policyholders died. In evaluating the GMDB
      exposures that exist within our variable annuity business relative to industry
      peers, it is important to distinguish between the various types of GMDB
      features, and other factors such as average account values, average amounts
      of
      NAR, and the age of contractholders. The following table and discussion provides
      this information for our variable annuity business as of December 31, 2005:

We
      have
      variable annuity contracts containing GMDBs that have a dollar for dollar
      withdrawal feature. Under such a feature, withdrawals reduce both current
      account value and the GMDB amount on a dollar for dollar basis. For contracts
      containing this dollar for dollar feature, the account holder could withdraw
      a
      substantial portion of their account value resulting in a GMDB that is multiples
      of the current account value. Our exposure to this dollar for dollar risk is
      somewhat mitigated by the fact that we do not allow for partial 1035 exchanges
      on non-qualified contracts. To take advantage of the dollar for dollar feature,
      the contractholder must take constructive receipt of the withdrawal and pay
      any
      applicable surrender charges. We report the appropriate amount of the withdrawal
      that is taxable to the Internal Revenue Service, as well as indicating whether
      or not tax penalties apply under the premature distribution tax rules. We
      closely monitor the dollar for dollar withdrawal GMDB exposure and work with
      key
      broker dealers that distribute our variable annuity products. The GMDB feature
      offered on new sales is a pro-rata GMDB feature whereby each dollar of
      withdrawal reduces the GMDB benefit in proportion to the current GMDB to account
      value ratio. As of December 31, 2005, there were 778 contracts for which the
      death benefit to account value ratio was greater than ten to one. The NAR on
      these contracts was $49 million.


Comparison
      of 2004 to 2003

Revenues

Insurance
      fees increased in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result of increases in average
      daily variable annuity account values, reflecting the increase in net flows
      and
      improvement in the equity markets. Variable product sales were up 67% in 2004
      over 2003 while fixed product sales were down from the prior year.

Annuity
      deposits increased significantly in 2004 compared to 2003 with growth in both
      the individual variable annuity business and variable products within the
      employer-sponsored business. The growth in individual variable annuity deposits
      was a result of the introduction of the Lincoln Smart Security

SM

Advantage benefit in June of 2003 and expansion of the wholesaling force in
      LFD.
      Variable annuity gross deposits in our Lincoln ChoicePlus

SM

and
      American Legacy products were up 100% for 2004 to $5.9 billion, compared to
      $2.9
      billion for 2003, as a result of the addition of the GMWB feature of the Lincoln
      Smart Security

SM

Advantage benefit.

Individual
      fixed annuity deposits declined for 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to
      the
      low interest rate environment. Similar to 2005, we approached the fixed annuity
      marketplace on an opportunistic basis throughout 2003 and into 2004. In our
      employer-markets business, mutual fund deposits into the Alliance program were
      $834 million in 2004, an increase of 35% from 2003. Our traditional annuity
      products showed growth with a 4% increase over the previous year.

Overall
      lapse rates were 8.9% in 2004 compared to 9.0% in 2003 and were more favorable
      than the level of persistency expected in product pricing. In addition, as
      described above, we experienced an increase in deposits within the Alliance
      program offered within the employer-sponsored marketplace.

Insurance
      premiums increased $11.1 million in 2004, or 51%, compared to 2003, primarily
      driven by increases in annuities in the payout phase, mainly in the American
      Legacy and Single Premium Immediate Annuity products. There was a corresponding
      increase in the benefit line from the resulting increase in reserves.

Net
      investment income increased slightly in 2004 compared to 2003. Fixed annuity
      account values increased during 2004 from net flows and investment income.
      Although investment rates during 2004 remained at levels below our portfolio
      rate, the higher account values and income from commercial mortgage loan
      prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and contingent interest income were
      the
      drivers of higher investment income. In 2004, net investment income included
      $41.0 million from prepayment premium, compared to $17.3 million in 2003. In
      addition, the segment received $13.0 million of contingent interest income.
      Excluding these items, investment income declined for 2004 compared to 2003.

Although
      net investment income declined in 2004 compared to 2003, interest credited
      to
      policyholder balances decreased year over year as a result of crediting rate
      actions we took in 2003 and 2004. The interest rate margin increased to 2.36%
      for 2004 from 2.16% for 2003. After removing the effects of the contingent
      interest received in 2004 and prepayment premiums in 2004 and 2003, interest
      rate margin was level in 2004 compared to 2003 at 2.10%.

Expenses

Insurance
      benefits include interest credited to policyholders, which decreased to $836
      million in 2004 from $867.7 million in 2003 as a result of actions taken by
      the
      segment to lower crediting rates commensurate with the reduction in the overall
      investment yield.

In
      the
      third quarter of 2004, we completed our annual comprehensive review of the
      assumptions underlying the prospective amortization of DAC, PVIF, DSI, and
      GMDB
      reserves. This review resulted in a favorable unlocking adjustment due to
      continued favorable contract retention and modeling refinements offset by spread
      compression. In 2004, the result of this prospective unlocking was a reduction
      in expenses of $32.3 million pre-tax ($21.0 million after-tax), compared to
      a
      $2.3 million pre-tax ($1.5 million after-tax) reduction in expenses from the
      comprehensive review completed in 2003.

Included
      in insurance benefits is DSI net of associated amortization. The amortization
      methodology used for DSI is the same as that utilized for DAC. The SOP became
      effective January 1, 2004. Accordingly, the accounting for DSI is different
      in
      2004 than in 2003. As a result, our insurance benefits were $7.9 million lower
      in 2004 relative to 2003.

Included
      in the segment’s insurance benefits are the costs associated with guaranteed
      benefits included within variable annuities with the GMDB or GMWB riders. As
      discussed above, our reserving for GMDB changed effective January 1, 2004 with
      our adoption of the SOP. As a result, under the SOP GMDB reserves are not
      subject to the same period-to-period


volatility
      from changes in the equity markets as was the case under our previous reserving
      methodology. In addition, during 2004 we expanded our hedging of GMDB reserves
      and entered into hedges for GMWB. The assumptions we use in computing our GMDB
      reserves are essentially the same as those used in our DAC amortization
      methodology. In 2004 and 2003 we unlocked those assumptions on a prospective
      basis. The decrease in insurance benefits in 2004 compared to 2003 was a result
      of these actions and the performance of the equity markets in 2004 relative
      to
      2003.

Outlook

Demographics
      provide a significant opportunity for growth for our various annuity products.
      As the baby-boomer generation ages, they are now shifting their focus from
      accumulating assets for retirement to income-generating products that will
      also
      provide stability in their retirement. At the same time, annuity products are
      being designed to meet these needs. Our continuing efforts in strengthening
      distribution through increased market share with key accounts will contribute
      to
      future growth. However, as account values grow, it becomes more difficult to
      maintain consistent growth in net flows.

Our
      i4LIFE® Advantage rider combines a lifetime income guarantee with access to the
      underlying account value and continued growth potential through investment
      in
      the market. To mitigate investor concerns of continued market decline, the
      optional GIB provides a guarantee to the investor of a minimum income for life.
      It also provides for a potentially higher payment should an investor's net
      investment results surpass i4LIFE® Advantage rider assumptions (assumed interest
      rate). Elections of Lincoln's i4LIFE® Advantage for 2005 were $1.0 billion, an
      increase of 144% over total elections of $410 million for 2004.

Economic
      and market conditions and the level of interest rates have been volatile over
      the past several years. This volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace
      has
      impacted fixed and variable annuity sales for both the industry and Lincoln
      Retirement. Customer behavior has been influenced by these factors as well
      as by
      the introduction of new products and product features, including the very
      popular living benefits products. Lincoln Retirement’s living benefit product,
      Lincoln Smart Security

SM

Advantage, was introduced in 2003 and has resulted in increased deposits in
      our
      variable annuities. While we expect this strong deposit result to continue,
      history has shown that, because of competitive pressures, new product
      innovations may have only a relatively short-term impact on market share.

New
      money
      rates continue to be at levels below our existing portfolio yield. This will
      continue to cause pressure on our investment margins. At December 31, 2005,
      approximately 88%, or $18.6 billion, of our $21.1 billion of fixed annuity
      account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts,
      were
      at the contractual minimum with another 7% or $1.5 billion within 50 basis
      points of contractual minimums. Continued low interest rates would lower
      portfolio earned rates and move more of our crediting rates to the contractual
      minimum, causing a drop in investment spreads. Conversely, if interest rates
      were to rise rapidly it could lead to disintermediation risk. Refer to the
      discussion on investment margin above for the impact of margin compression
      expected in 2006.

One
      of
      our fixed annuity products, the Step Five Fixed Annuity has a sixty-day window
      period following each five year fixed guarantee period. Crediting rates for
      each
      subsequent five-year, fixed guarantee period are set at the beginning of the
      window period.

During
      the window period, account holders can withdraw their funds without incurring
      a
      surrender charge. Account values for this product were $2.8 billion at December
      31, 2005, and approximately $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion of account values
      will
      enter the window period in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Given the current
      interest rate environment, we would expect to see our lapse rate increase in
      2006 as a portion of these account holders withdraw their funds, but we would
      not expect the after-DAC, after-tax effect to be significant to the earnings
      of
      the Lincoln Retirement segment, helped in part by a 50% coinsurance arrangement
      on 87% of the account values.

Changes
      in tax laws and additional regulatory scrutiny of variable annuities could
      have
      a negative impact on our ability to grow the business. See “Part I—Item
      1—Business—Regulatory Matters.” To deal with these uncertainties, we remain
      committed to our two-pronged approach of growing new deposits and retaining
      existing assets to manage net flows. We expect to continue to strengthen
      distribution breadth, utilize and improve upon the balanced portfolio of annuity
      products, and aggressively manage expenses as key profitability drivers in
      the
      challenging annuity market.

For
      additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
      those set forth in this outlook section, see “Part I—Item 1—Risk Factors” and
“Forward-looking Statements—Cautionary Language” above.

Comparison
      of 2005 to 2004

Revenues,
      First Year Premium, In-force and Net Amount at Risk

Revenues
      increased modestly in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to higher net
      investment income, which is explained below. Insurance fees include surrender
      charges, mortality assessments and expense assessments. Mortality assessments
      increased $14.8 million, or 3%, for 2005, which is in line with the growth
      in UL
      and Other face amount in-force, and NAR (Other includes VUL, whole life, ISWL
      and COLI; UL and Other products are referred to as permanent products).
      Mortality assessments are comprised of COI’s charged to policyholders in
      relation to the NAR less the cost of reinsurance premiums that we pay for
      reinsurance coverage. In recent years, we have reinsured a larger percentage
      of
      the mortality risk on our business than in the past. As older business with
      a
      lower percentage of reinsurance has run off, this has had the effect of slowing
      the growth of revenues from net mortality assessments. Partially offsetting
      the
      increase in mortality assessments were lower revenues for surrender charges
      due
      to favorable persistency. The improved persistency results in higher business
      in
      force, which should positively affect future revenues.


The
      increase in life insurance in-force and NAR has been driven primarily by the
      growth in term life insurance. It is important to view the in-force and NAR
      growth separately for term products versus UL and other permanent products,
      as
      term products by design have a lower profitability to face amount relationship
      than do permanent life insurance products. Insurance premium revenue relates
      to
      whole life and term life insurance products. Term and whole life insurance
      products have insurance fees and COIs generated from the NAR. These are
      components of the change in policy reserves on these products, and are reflected
      in insurance benefits. Insurance premiums increased 2% in 2005 compared to
      2004.
      Insurance premiums for term insurance increased 24% for 2005 compared to 2004,
      while insurance premiums for whole life decreased 6% in 2005 compared to 2004.
      For term insurance, gross premiums grew 9% from continued growth in the book
      of
      business. Also contributing to the growth in net term insurance premiums was
      a
      5% reduction in premiums paid for reinsurance coverage in 2005 compared to
      2004,
      primarily resulting from restructuring our reinsurance program in September
      2005. Under the restructured program, we reduced the percentage of each new
      term
      policy reinsured and moved from coinsurance to renewable term
      reinsurance.

First
      year premiums are not part of revenues (other than for term products) and do
      not
      have a significant impact on current quarter income from operations, but are
      indicative of future profitability. Total first year premiums for 2005 increased
      3% compared to 2004, due to UL and VUL increases of $18.8 million and $21.8
      million (3% and 26%), respectively, compared to 2004. The equity market
      turnaround and the fourth quarter 2004 introduction of the VUL

ONE

product
      were the primary drivers of the VUL increases. The segment introduced a new
      UL
      product during the third quarter of 2004, which generated sales of approximately
      $187.8 million for 2005.

Net
      investment income for 2005 included $10.9 million pre-tax from commercial
      mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums compared to $25.0 million
      for 2004. Net investment income in 2005 included $5.7 million pre-tax from
      the
      second quarter receipt of fees from standby real estate equity commitments
      and
      2004 included $8.9 million pre-tax of contingent interest income ($6.5 million
      in the interest sensitive lines and $2.4 million for traditional non-dividend
      participating (“Non-par”) products). Absent these items, interest rate margins
      for the Life Insurance segment’s interest sensitive products improved in 2005
      compared to 2004, while those of traditional products declined.

Interest
      sensitive products include UL and ISWL and provide for interest to be credited
      to policyholder accounts. The difference between what we credit to policyholder
      accounts and interest income we earn on interest sensitive assets is interest
      rate margin. Traditional non- par products include term and whole life insurance
      with interest income used to build the policy reserves. At December 31, 2005,
      interest-sensitive products represented approximately 89% of total interest
      sensitive and traditional Non-par earning assets, up slightly from 2004. At
      December 31, 2005, 42% of the interest sensitive account values have crediting
      rates at contract guaranteed levels and 53% have crediting rates within 50
      basis
      points of contractual guarantees. We expect a slight reduction of approximately
      one to two basis points

per
      quarter in interest rate margins in the subsequent quarters for the Life
      Insurance segment. This assumes a 50 basis point annual improvement in new
      money
      investment rates and no significant changes in net flows in or out of our fixed
      accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate margins to differ from
      our expectation. For information on interest rate margins and the interest
      rate
      risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
      Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Form 10-K.

Expenses

Insurance
      benefits include interest credited to policyholders of $590.2 million in 2005
      compared to $579.7 million in 2004. Actions taken by the segment to lower
      crediting rates commensurate with the reduction in the overall investment yield
      in 2004 and 2005 partially offset the effects of growth in the book of business.
      See the table above for the interest rate credited to policyholders.

During
      the third quarter of 2005, we conducted our annual comprehensive review of
      the
      assumptions underlying the amortization of DAC, PVIF and DFEL. We reviewed
      the
      various assumptions including investment rate margins, mortality and retention.
      As a result of this comprehensive review, in 2005, the Life Insurance segment
      had DAC/PVIF/DFEL net prospective positive unlocking adjustment of $4.5 million
      pre-tax ($2.9 million after-tax), primarily reflecting improved mortality
      assumptions, partially offset by less favorable retention and interest rate
      assumptions. The comprehensive review during 2005 also resulted in a decrease
      in
      the on-going amortization expense of approximately $1.1 million pre-tax ($0.7
      million after-tax) per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of
      2005.

For
      2004,
      this segment had negative prospective DAC unlocking of $23.7 million pre-tax
      ($15.4 million after-tax), resulting primarily from a reduction in the
      assumption of future investment yields. The comprehensive review during the
      third quarter of 2004 also resulted in an increase in the on-going amortization
      expense of approximately $3 million pre-tax ($2 million after-tax) per quarter
      beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004.


UL
      and
      VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 23% of
      permanent life insurance in-force at December 31, 2005 and approximately 81%
      of
      first year premiums for these products. In July 2005, a committee of the NAIC
      adopted a change to Actuarial Guideline 38 (also known as “AXXX”), the statutory
      reserve requirements for UL products with secondary guarantees, such as Lincoln
      National Life’s lapse protection rider (“LPR”). This proposal was formally
      adopted by the NAIC in October 2005 with an effective date of July 1, 2005.

The
      proposal does not affect business written prior to the effective date of July
      1,
      2005. Application of this guideline to sales of UL products with secondary
      guarantees subsequent to July 1 resulted in an increase to statutory reserves
      of
      approximately $90 million, which reduced statutory surplus by approximately
      $65
      million at December 31, 2005. There was no impact to GAAP reserves. We continue
      to evaluate potential modifications to our universal life products with
      secondary guarantees that may be made in response to the revised regulation.
      Although the impact of this proposal on future sales of guaranteed no-lapse
      UL
      cannot be predicted, it may result in a price increase for such products.

Comparison
      of 2004 to 2003

Revenues,
      First Year Premium, In-force and Net Amount at Risk

Revenues
      were up $46.8 million, or 2%, in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to an
      increase in net investment income of $37.3 million. Revenues from insurance
      fees
      increased 1%. This increase in insurance fees was in line with the lack of
      growth in UL and Other face amount in-force, and NAR. The increase in life
      insurance in-force and NAR was driven by the growth in term life insurance.
      Total first year premiums for 2004 declined from 2003, primarily due to a
      decrease of $52.1 million, or 41%, in the COLI business. First year premiums
      in
      2003 included the results of a large COLI case with first year premiums of
      $33.2
      million. First year premium in the retail business was up $17.0 million, or
      2%.
      The increase in retail was driven by sales of MoneyGuard

®

.
      Due to
      the equity market turnaround and the introduction of a new product, first year
      premiums for VUL were up slightly in 2004 compared to 2003. UL accounted for
      88%
      of total retail UL/VUL sales in 2004, consistent with 2003.

The
      decline in first year premiums for UL, excluding MoneyGuard

®

,
      in 2004
      was due to increased competition.

Net
      investment income for the Life Insurance segment for 2004 included $25.0 million
      from prepayment premiums and $8.9 million of contingent interest income.
      Interest rate margins for the Life Insurance segment improved in 2004, compared
      to 2003.

Expenses

Insurance
      benefits include interest credited to policyholders, which decreased to $579.7
      million in 2004, compared to $598.2 million in 2003, as a result of actions
      taken by the segment to lower crediting rates commensurate with the reduction
      in
      the overall investment yield. As stated above, our comprehensive review of
      DAC/PVIF/DFEL in 2004 resulted in negative unlocking of $23.7 million pre-tax
      ($15.4 million after-tax). In 2003, the segment also experienced negative
      prospective DAC unlocking of $30.5 million pre-tax ($19.8 million after-tax),
      resulting primarily from revised assumptions regarding face amount reductions
      and reinsurance premiums. The 2003 change in assumptions resulted in lower
      future EGPs, leading to the increased DAC amortization expense in 2004.

Outlook

In
      2005,
      we experienced significant competitive pressures on our products. Although
      our
      new UL product introduced in late 2004 improved our first year premium growth,
      we experienced significant competition with our MoneyGuard

®

product,
      and we expect to continue to see strong competition in 2006, especially with
      respect to products with secondary guarantees. As a result of the strong growth
      in VUL sales in 2005, driven by increasing acceptance of the VUL

ONE

product
      by the marketplace, we expect to see continued solid growth. As we have a large
      block of in-force business with lapse rates averaging 6 to 8% on the mature
      blocks, sales at levels consistent with recent experience are not expected
      to
      result in significant growth of the overall business in-force. We expect this
      will constrain growth in our insurance fees. However, we do expect overall
      first-year premiums and revenues to grow in 2006 and in the long-term. Continued
      strength in the equity and credit markets, as well as the diversity of our
      products and strong distribution, provide a favorable environment for increasing
      our first year premiums.

New
      money
      rates continue to be at levels below our existing portfolio yield, which will
      continue to cause pressure on our investment margins. At December 31, 2005,
      approximately $5.2 billion, or 42%, of our $12.5 billion of UL and
      interest-sensitive whole life insurance account values were at contractual
      minimums with another $6.6 billion, or 53%, within 50


basis
      points of contractual minimums. Refer to the discussion on investment margin
      above for the impact of margin compression expected in 2006.

As
      discussed above, we changed our reinsurance program in September 2005 for new
      term life policies and made further changes to the program in January 2006,
      as
      discussed later in Reinsurance. These changes reduce reinsurance premiums and
      reduce the amount of losses we recover from reinsurers on any one loss. While
      we
      expect the reduction in reinsurance costs to benefit results going forward,
      we
      could experience more volatility in earnings from mortality losses.

As
      discussed above and described in “Part I—Item 1—Business—Regulatory Matters,”
the NAIC implemented changes in 2005 to statutory reserving requirements for
      life insurance companies related to universal life products with secondary
      guarantees, such as LPR. UL policies with lapse protection riders amount to
      approximately $30.9 billion of our in-force face amount. Although potential
      changes are still being reviewed, any change that would have the effect of
      increasing statutory reserves could affect product design and pricing, and
      as
      such could impact the availability and profitability of these products.

For
      additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
      those set forth in this outlook section, see “Part I—Item 1—Risk Factors” and
“Forward-looking Statements—Cautionary Language” above.

Note:

The
                net flows in the above table exclude the transfer of $1.0 billion
                related
                to the outsourced mutual fund based 401(k) record-keeping business
                in
                2004. The term deposits in the above table and in the following discussion
                represents purchases of mutual funds and managed accounts, deposits
                in
                variable annuity funds, and inflows in advisory accounts. Amounts
                in the
                table above include DIAL through September 2004.

The
      following table presents the segment’s net flows with and without DIAL.


Comparison
      of 2005 to 2004

Revenues,
      Deposits and Net Flows

Investment
      advisory fees—retail/institutional increased 10 % in 2005 compared to 2004.
      Investment advisory fees included $47.2 million from DIAL for 2004. Excluding
      DIAL, investment advisory fees-retail/institutional increased 36 % for 2005
      compared to 2004, due to higher average levels of assets under management
      resulting from changes in the equity markets, changes in product mix and
      positive net flows. Net flows for 2005 were 55% higher than 2004. The level
      of
      net flows in 2005 was significantly higher than previous periods for both
      institutional and retail business. We believe that the increase in net flows
      was
      attributable to several factors, including changes in the management of certain
      asset category offerings, the recognition in the marketplace of improving
      investment performance, and the expanded wholesaling of the segment’s products
      by LFD. The level of net flows may vary considerably from period to period
      and
      net flows in one period may not be indicative of net flows in subsequent
      periods.

Investment
      advisory fees include amounts that are ultimately paid to sub-advisors for
      managing the sub-advised assets. The amounts paid to sub-advisors are included
      in the expenses of the segment. In addition, included in the investment advisory
      fees—retail/institutional are fees earned from managing funds included within
      our variable annuity and life insurance products.

Investment
      advisory fees - insurance related is made up of fees for asset management
      services this segment provides for our general account assets supporting our
      fixed products and surplus, including those of the Lincoln Retirement and Life
      Insurance segments. As a result of analysis performed in the latter half of
      2004, effective January 1, 2005, we reduced the inter-segment fees paid to
      the
      Investment Management segment by approximately 2 basis points, or 12%, which
      resulted in a negative impact of $2.9 million after-tax in 2005. This was offset
      by corresponding net positive impacts within the Lincoln Retirement and Life
      Insurance segments.

The
      increase in insurance fees from our annuity-based 401(k) Lincoln
      Director

SM

business
      (“Director”) primarily related to higher assets under management due to equity
      market performance and positive net flows of $

0.4

billion
      in 2005. Assets under management for this business were $

6.5

billion
      and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The
      increase in assets under management from December 31, 2004 to 2005 is primarily
      the result of market value gains and positive net flows. Market value gains
      for
      2005 were $3.2 billion in retail and $1.9 billion in institutional. Net flows
      were $7.1 billion in retail and $8.9 billion in institutional for 2005.

On
      September 24, 2004, we completed the sale of DIAL to the unit’s management group
      and an unaffiliated investor. As a result of the sale of DIAL, certain retail
      assets are now sub-advised by Mondrian, the buyer. Sub-advised assets represent
      18% of the segment’s assets under management at December 31, 2005, compared to
      14% at December 31, 2004. As stated above, the segment pays fees to the
      sub-advisor for managing the assets. Also, in 2004, the segment outsourced
      its
      mutual fund based 401(k) record-keeping business. As a result, approximately
      $1
      billion of the retirement accounts were transferred to third parties during
      2004. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, “Results of
      Consolidated Operations” above and “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition -
      Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information.

Expenses

Underwriting,
      acquisition, insurance and other expenses increased 10% in 2005 compared to
      2004, primarily from expenses that vary with revenues or levels of assets under
      management. These expenses include the fees we pay to third party sub-advisors.
      Payments to LFD for wholesaling services increased $8.5 million, or 26
      %

in 2005
      compared to

2004,
      as
      a result of the strong retail deposits in 2005. Unlike the capitalization of
      acquisition costs with insurance products, in the asset management business,
      we
      are not able to capitalize the acquisition costs of new business. Operating
      expenses for 2005 also include severance of approximately $9.7 million pre-tax
      ($6.3 million after-tax). In addition, expenses in 2005 were higher as the
      result of adding two investment teams during 2005. In 2005 several growth equity
      managers and certain other investment personnel joined us to form a new large
      cap equity growth team and a new international equity team joined the firm
      as
      well.

During
      the third quarter of 2005, the segment performed its annual comprehensive review
      of DAC assumptions related to the Director business. As a result, 2005 expenses
      were reduced for prospective unlocking of $4.7 million pre-tax ($3.1 million
      after-tax), primarily related to favorable expenses and continuing higher than
      expected retention rates. In the third


quarter
      of 2004, the annual comprehensive review resulted in a reduction to expenses
      for
      prospective unlocking of approximately $3 million pre-tax ($2 million
      after-tax), primarily related to the continued improvement in retention
      rates.

Comparison
      of 2004 to 2003

Revenues,
      Deposits and Net Flows

The
      increase in investment advisory fees—retail/institutional was a result of higher
      average level of assets under management, resulting from rising equity markets
      and positive net flows. The increase in insurance fees from the
      Director

SM

business
      primarily related to higher assets under management from equity market
      performance. Assets under management for this business were $5.6 billion and
      $4.6 billion in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other revenues include changes
      in
      the value of seed capital, as well as shareholder servicing and accounting
      fees
      for services provided to mutual funds and variable annuity products that we
      sponsor.

Other
      revenues decreased in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the seed capital
      component.

Seed
      capital represents the amount of capital invested to start a new fund or
      product. Seed capital investments are accounted for in a manner consistent
      with
      the accounting for trading securities, with changes in fair market value
      reported as a component of revenues.

The
      equity market related increase in the value of seed capital was less in 2004
      than in 2003, and we had less invested in seed capital in 2004.

The
      decline in assets under management from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to the
      sale of DIAL, which resulted in a $22.1 billion reduction in assets under
      management as of September 24, 2004, partially offset by market value gains
      and
      positive net flows. Market value gains in 2004 were $3.5 billion in retail
      and
      $2.5 billion in institutional. Excluding the effects from the DIAL sale,
      positive net flows across equity and fixed income products accounted for the
      growth in both institutional and retail assets under management. Retail net
      flows reflected higher deposits, partially offset by higher withdrawals.

Expenses

Underwriting,
      acquisition, insurance and other expenses increased in 2004 compared to 2003,
      primarily from expenses that vary with revenues or levels of assets under
      management. Results for 2004 included

the
      prospective DAC unlocking described above. In 2003, the annual review did not
      result in material prospective unlocking.

Included
      in the segment’s expenses was the change in value of our deferred compensation
      liability related to the segment. Changes in the value of this liability arise
      from changes in the financial markets (equity and fixed income) and the
      underlying investment choices of the participants. During 2004, we entered
      into
      a total return swap agreement to hedge the affect of changes in the deferred
      compensation liability due to changes caused by the equity markets. The swap
      reduced the impact of equity market changes on the deferred compensation
      liability and the related amount recorded to expense relative to 2003. For
      more
      information on the deferred compensation liability, see Note 8 to the
      Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
      effective tax rate in 2004 was higher than in 2003, primarily due to a tax
      benefit in 2003 from a change in tax laws in the United Kingdom permitting
      a
      deduction for stock compensation expense related to Delaware options granted
      to
      the employees of DIAL. The tax benefit recognized in 2003 reflected a deduction
      for the fair value of options granted in current and prior years that were
      outstanding at January 1, 2003.

Outlook

For
      the
      last few years, we have been focusing on five key areas for improving the
      investment management business: attracting and retaining a strong team of
      investment and research professionals, enhancing the investment process,
      sustaining strong investment performance, increasing net flows, and improving
      profitability. We believe we have been successful in each of our areas of focus
      through the attraction of key talent and improvements in our business model.
      In
      2004, we sold DIAL and outsourced the administration of its mutual fund-based
      retirement product to third parties.

Economic
      and market conditions and the level of interest rates have been volatile over
      the past several years, and have impacted the segment’s operating performance.
      We believe that the increase in net flows and assets under management in 2005
      compared to 2004 is attributable to several factors, including changes in the
      management of certain asset category offerings, the recognition in the
      marketplace of improving investment performance, and the expanded wholesaling
      of
      the segment’s products by LFD. The level of net flows may vary considerably from
      period to period and therefore net flows in one period may not be indicative
      of
      net flows in subsequent periods. While we expect investment performance to
      remain solid and look for sustained positive net flows in 2006, capacity
      constraints in certain asset classes or products may limit growth relative
      to
      2005 levels.


Significant
      and sustained changes in equity markets could have a negative impact on assets
      under management and net flows. In addition, the Investment Management segment
      may also be affected by legislative or regulatory changes made in response
      to
      current industry-wide matters of concern, including, but not limited to market
      timing, late trading, and soft-dollar arrangements.

For
      additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
      those set forth in this outlook section, see “Part I — Item 1 — Risk Factors”
and “Forward-looking Statements — Cautionary Language” above.

Note:

Lincoln
                UK’s balance sheets and income statements are translated at the current
                spot exchange rate as of year-end and average spot exchange rate
                for the
                year, respectively.

Comparison
      of 2005 to 2004

Revenues

During
      2005, the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound
      sterling decreased 1% compared to 2004. Excluding the effect of the exchange
      rate, insurance premiums were down approximately 9% for 2005, compared to 2004,
      resulting from the continuing decline of the in-force block. Our policy lapse
      rate for 2005 was 6.8% compared to 7.0% in 2004, as measured by the number
      of
      policies in-force. Insurance fees benefited from higher average equity-linked
      account values resulting largely from the increase in the U.K. equity markets.
      As illustrated by the performance of the FTSE 100 index, U.K. equity markets
      increased 16.7% at December 31, 2005 from December 31, 2004; the daily average
      basis FTSE 100 for 2005 was up 14.1% from 2004.

Other
      revenues decreased 43% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to lower net
      DFEL
      unlocking adjustments in 2005 compared to 2004. Included in other revenues
      are
      net positive DFEL unlocking adjustments of approximately $10 million pre-tax
      ($6
      million after-tax) for 2005 and $25 million pre-tax ($16 million after-tax)
      for
      2004. These adjustments resulted from our 2005 and 2004 comprehensive reviews
      of
      assumptions underlying the amortization of DAC/PVIF/DFEL and the 2005 pension
      funding discussed below. The 2005 and 2004 comprehensive assumption reviews
      resulted in a positive impact to income from operations of approximately $3
      million pre-tax ($2 million after-tax) for both years. The impact on DAC and
      PVIF of unlocking resulting from comprehensive assumption reviews and the
      pension funding is included in expenses.

Expenses

Expenses
      were lower in 2005, compared to 2004, as increases in insurance benefits were
      offset by lower underwriting, acquisition and operating expenses. Insurance
      benefits for 2005 included $11.0 million pre-tax ($7.2 million after-tax) to
      increase the reserve for selling practice matters as a result of greater than
      expected levels of customer complaints. Insurance benefits for 2004 include
      a
      release of $4.8 million pre-tax ($3.1 million after-tax) of reserves related
      to
      lapsed policies. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
      additional information on the reserve for selling practices.

In
      October 2005, Lincoln UK funded its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan with
      a
      contribution of approximately $71 million. As a result, we expect annual pre-tax
      pension expense will be reduced by approximately $2 million. This reduction
      in
      expenses impacts future EGPs used in determining DAC/PVIF/DFEL amortization
      and
      resulted in a favorable fourth quarter prospective unlocking adjustment of
      approximately $11 million pre-tax ($7 million after-tax). We expect it should
      result in lower expenses after-DAC/DFEL going forward.

The
        decline in underwriting, acquisition and operating expenses in 2005, compared
        to
        2004, primarily reflects the net favorable change between years in DAC/PVIF
        unlocking of approximately $40 million pre-tax ($26 million after-tax) resulting
        from the 2005 pension funding favorable unlocking and negative retrospective
        unlocking of assumptions for DAC and PVIF that occurred in 2004 from increasing
        equity markets. The completion of the third quarter 2005 comprehensive review
        of
        assumptions underlying the amortization of DAC/PVIF/DFEL resulted in unfavorable
        adjustments to DAC/PVIF amortization, primarily from an unfavorable modeling
        correction in the DAC amortization calculation process offset by favorable
        persistency. In addition, in 2004 we adjusted our assumptions related to
        the
        impact of equity markets on tax related fees for unit-linked business, primarily
        from changes in the assumption for policy retention, which favorably impacted
        income from operations of approximately $8 million pre-tax ($5 million
        after-tax) in 2004. The impact of this unlocking on
        DAC/PVIF/DFEL is included in the adjustments discussed
        above.


In
      2004,
      our comprehensive review of assumptions underlying the amortization of
      DAC/PVIF/DFEL resulted in positive unlocking reducing income by approximately
      $3
      million pre-tax ($2 million after-tax). In addition, we adjusted our assumptions
      related to the impact of equity markets on tax related fees for unit-linked
      business, primarily from changes in the assumption for policy retention, which
      resulted in increased amortization expenses of approximately $8 million pre-tax

($5
      million after-tax).

Lincoln
      UK maintains reserves established in 1997 and 1999 for mis-selling activities.
      On an ongoing basis, Lincoln UK evaluates various assumptions underlying these
      estimated liabilities, including the expected levels of future complaints and
      the potential implications with respect to the adequacy of the aggregate
      liability associated with UK selling practice matters. Based upon our evaluation
      in 2005, we increased the reserve for selling practice matters by $11.0 million
      pre-tax ($7.2 million after-tax) as a result of greater than expected levels
      of
      customer complaints. During 2005, there continued to be aggressive marketing
      by
      companies seeking to pursue claims on behalf of individual policyholders prior
      to the expiration of time limits established in 2004 by the U.K. Financial
      Services Authority for making a complaint for mortgage endowments. Offsetting
      the increase in reserves in 2004 were insurance reimbursements of costs incurred
      in connection with mis-selling practices. The net effect of the increase in
      mis-selling reserves and the favorable settlements resulted in lower expenses
      in
      2004 of $9.0 million pre-tax ($5.9 million after-tax). Future changes in
      complaint levels could effect Lincoln UK’s ultimate exposure to mis-selling
      issues, although we believe that any future change would not materially effect
      our consolidated financial position.

The
      services provided to the segment under the Capita agreement are currently deemed
      to be exempt from value added tax (“VAT”). In a recent ruling by the European
      Court of Justice regarding a similar arrangement involving a Dutch insurer,
      it
      was deemed that VAT should be applied to such an arrangement. The U.K.
      authorities are required to take note of this ruling in determining U.K.
      legislation and in July 2005 issued a consultation paper outlining their
      intention to amend U.K. legislation so that VAT applies to contracts, such
      as
      our arrangement with Capita. In December 2005, U.K. authorities postponed their
      decision to implement legislation until after the European Commission has
      completed its review of the VAT treatment of insurance and financial services.
      It is uncertain when this review will be completed and what the outcome will
      be.
      Future changes in the application of VAT to Lincoln UK’s outsourcing arrangement
      with Capita could impact the segment’s results, although we believe that any
      future change would not materially effect our consolidated financial
      position.

Comparison
      of 2004 to 2003

Revenues

During
      2004, the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound
      sterling increased 12%, compared to 2003. The increase in insurance premiums
      was
      primarily a result of the increase in the exchange rate. Excluding the effect
      of
      the exchange rate, insurance premiums were down approximately 1%. Insurance
      fees
      also benefited from the exchange rate increase and the higher average
      equity-linked account values resulting largely from the increase in the U.K.
      equity markets. As illustrated by the performance of the FTSE 100 index, U.K.
      equity markets increased 7.5% in 2004 and 14% in 2003. However, on a daily
      average basis, the FTSE 100 was up only 1% in 2004 over its opening position
      on
      January 1, 2004. Policy lapse rates for 2004 were 7%, an improvement over the
      7.5% rate for 2003 as measured by the number of policies in force.

Other
      revenues increased $34.2 million, or 184%, over 2003, primarily due to the
      impact of equity markets and the positive unlocking of DFEL included in other
      revenue. The performance of the equity markets in 2004 was below our long-term
      growth assumption of 9% as well as being significantly lower than the
      performance of the equity markets in 2003. This resulted in positive DFEL
      unlocking relative to 2003. In addition, the segment experienced positive DFEL
      unlocking as it adjusted the assumptions related to the impact of equity markets
      on tax related fees for its unit-linked business. In the third quarter of 2004,
      Lincoln UK completed its comprehensive review of assumptions underlying the
      amortization of DAC/PVIF/DFEL. The review of assumptions led to a revision
      of
      lapse rate assumptions, resulting in negative unlocking of DFEL. Because DFEL
      is
      a liability, changes in amortization generally have the opposite effect on
      income than does the changes on DAC and PVIF.


Expenses

Expenses
      were higher in 2004 compared to 2003, due to the net negative unlocking of
      assumptions for DAC and PVIF related to the same items as noted above for DFEL.
      The combined effects of the net unlocking activities for DAC/PVIF and DFEL
      resulted in a reduction in income of $13.1 million pre-tax ($8.5 million
      after-tax). Insurance benefits increased $1.8 million, or 2%, in 2004 compared
      to 2003. Excluding the effects of the exchange rate, insurance benefits
      decreased approximately $9 million, including the release of $4.8 million
      pre-tax ($3.1 million after-tax) of reserves related to lapsed policies from
      the
      review of our policy valuation systems in the third quarter of 2004. During
      2004, the net effect of the increase in mis-selling reserves and the favorable
      insurance settlements resulted in lower expenses as discussed above. Lincoln
      UK’s U.S. effective Federal income tax rate for 2004 was 35%, slightly higher
      than the 33.4% for 2003, primarily due to a tax benefit in 2003 from a change
      in
      tax laws in the United Kingdom permitting a deduction for stock options
      exercised after January 1, 2003. The tax benefit recognized in the fourth
      quarter of 2003 reflected a deduction for the fair value of options that were
      outstanding as of January 1, 2003.

Outlook

Lincoln
      UK continues to focus on protecting and enhancing the value of its customer
      base
      as well as evaluating new sources of revenue. We believe the segment has been
      successful in maintaining its existing customer base. Through the outsourcing
      of
      its administrative services to Capita Life & Pensions Services Limited, a
      subsidiary of Capita Group Plc (“Capita”), the segment has been able to maintain
      efficient operations and effectively control costs. Although the use of the
      enhanced reversion to the mean process has lessened the impact of short-term
      volatility of the equity markets, the segment remains subject to volatility
      in
      the equity markets on fee income. In addition, the segment is sensitive to
      changes in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the
      British pound sterling. A significant increase in the value of the U.S. dollar
      relative to the British pound would have a significant adverse effect on the
      segment’s operating results.

The
      services provided to the segment under the Capita agreement are currently deemed
      to be exempt from value added tax (“VAT”), which is levied at the rate of 17.5%.
      The European Commission is currently reviewing the application of VAT to
      insurance and financial services. The timing of this review and how it will
      impact our arrangement with Capita is uncertain and not likely to be resolved
      in
      the near future.

For
      additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
      those set forth in this outlook section, see “Part I—Item 1—Risk Factors” and
“Forward-looking Statements—Cautionary Language” above.

Other
      Operations

Comparison
      of 2005 to 2004

LFA

LFA’s
      operating results improved by $4.6 million for 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting
      lower expenses from expense management and realignment activities, partially
      offset by lower sales of our Life Insurance and Lincoln Retirement segments’
products and non-proprietary products and services.

LFA’s
      net
      revenues were $220.8 million for 2005 compared to $237.7 million for 2004.
      Net
      revenues are revenues received, primarily in compensation for the sale of a
      product or service, reduced by commissions owed to agents or brokers responsible
      for the sale or provision of service. Proprietary first year life insurance
      premiums distributed through LFA decreased 13% in 2005 compared to 2004. Lower
      deposits for proprietary individual annuity products of $153.5 million, a
      decline of 15%, for 2005 compared to 2004, also contributed to the decline
      in
      net revenues. Deposits into Delaware’s mutual funds through LFA were $231.3
      million for 2005, compared to $218.0 million for 2004. Because of increased
      levels of


deposits
      into non-commissionable mutual funds in 2005, LFA net revenues associated with
      Delaware mutual fund deposits for 2005 were level with 2004.

LFA
      implemented a restructuring plan in the second quarter of 2005 to realign field
      management and financial planning support areas, which we expect to result
      in
      reduced operating expenses. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
      Statements for additional discussion.

LFD

LFD
      operating results improved modestly for 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting higher
      sales, partially offset by the continuing expansion of the wholesaling force.
      LFD’s revenues represent wholesaling allowances paid by our operating segments
      to LFD for wholesaling our products. Sales growth was primarily a result of
      strong deposits in investment products and individual variable annuities for
      2005, and higher retail life insurance first year premiums in 2005. Deposits
      into mutual funds, managed accounts and 401(k) products for which LFD provided
      wholesaling services were $10.1 billion in 2005, a 39% increase over last year.
      Deposits into variable annuities were $7.4 billion for 2005, a 24% increase
      over
      last year. Deposits in the American Legacy Variable Annuity product were the
      key
      contributor to the variable annuity deposit growth in 2005. First year premiums
      of retail life insurance products through LFD were $684.6 million for 2005,
      a 9%
      increase from 2004.

Financing
      Costs

Interest
      expense on our debt for 2005 declined 6% compared to 2004 due to the maturity
      in
      May 2005 of 7.25% senior notes for $193 million, partially offset by increased
      rates on floating rate debt and higher commercial paper borrowings. The
      favorable effects of the 2004 refinancing of certain fixed rate debt at lower
      rates also contributed to the improvement. For additional information on our
      financing activities, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition—Liquidity
      and Cash Flow—Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow—Financing Activities.”

Amortization
      of Deferred Gain on Indemnity Reinsurance

Income
      from the amortization of the deferred gain was 13% lower for 2005 compared
      to
      2004, resulting from a positive third quarter 2004 adjustment to the deferred
      gain on the reinsurance business sold in 2001.

Other
      Corporate

Other
      Corporate had income from operations of $46.1 million for 2005 compared to
      an
      operating loss of $11.2 million for 2004. Included in operating income for
      and 2004 are reductions of $46.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively, in
      Federal income tax expense related to the release of a deferred tax valuation
      allowance in our Barbados reinsurance company. See Note 5 to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements for additional discussion.

Comparison
      of 2004 to 2003

LFA

LFA’s
      operating results improved by $15.4 million for 2004, compared to 2003, due
      to
      expense management resulting from realignment activities initiated in 2003
      and
      revenue growth as a result of an increase in deposits in certain lines, with
      increases in 2004 for proprietary individual annuity deposits of 66% and
      proprietary mutual funds of 60%. Proprietary first year life insurance premiums
      through LFA decreased 6% in 2004, driven by a 12% decrease in universal life,
      whole life and term life insurance products, partially offset by a 32% increase
      in variable life insurance products. Deposits into Delaware’s mutual funds
      through LFA were $218.0 million in 2004, an increase of 59% compared to 2003.
      Deposits into Delaware mutual funds through LFA represent approximately 11%
      of
      LFA’s total mutual fund deposits in 2004, approximately a 3% increase over 2003.
      LFA’s overall net revenue increased 7% in 2004.

LFD

LFD’s
      operating results for 2004 improved by $9.7 million, compared to 2003, primarily
      as a result of strong deposits in variable annuity and investment products
      and
      increased first year premium in retail life insurance. Deposits into variable
      annuities were $6.0 billion, an increase of 105% over 2003. Deposits in both
      the
      Lincoln ChoicePlus

SM

and the
      American Legacy Variable Annuity products were key contributors to the variable
      annuity deposit growth in 2004. Deposits into mutual funds, managed accounts
      and
      401(k) products distributed by LFD were $7.3 billion in 2004, an increase of
      70%
      over 2003.


First
      year premiums of retail life insurance products through LFD were $630.0 million,
      an increase of 7% over 2003. First year premium of COLI life insurance products
      were $74 million in 2004, down 41% from 2003. Improvements in both the number
      and quality of wholesalers, as well as favorable market conditions, contributed
      to the decrease in operating losses. Higher expenses, primarily associated
      with
      the continuing expansion of the wholesaling force, partially offset the
      favorable results from improved deposits and first year premiums.

Financing
      Costs

In
      2004,
      interest expense on our debt increased as a result of the February 2004 issuance
      of $200 million of 4.75% Notes due 2014, partially offset by lower interest
      rates and other changes made to our outstanding debt during 2004 and 2003,
      as
      described in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition—Liquidity and Cash
      Flow—Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow—Financial Derivatives.”

Amortization
      of Deferred Gain on Indemnity Reinsurance

Income
      from the amortization of the deferred gain includes an increase of $9.1 million
      resulting from an adjustment to the deferred gain in the third quarter of 2004
      on the reinsurance business sold in 2001.

Other
      Corporate

The
      operating loss in Other Corporate increased $5.8 million, due to higher costs
      associated with our realignment activities, expenses associated with litigation
      and other expenses. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was a $4.4
      million reduction in a deferred tax valuation allowance in our Barbados
      insurance company.

Outlook

During
      2005, LFA changed its compensation structure for its planners.

In
      2005,
      the number of new planners recruited to LFA was lower than in prior years,
      which
      is partially a result of LFA focusing more on recruiting experienced
      planners, while the number of planners leaving LFA during 2005 remained at
      a
      level that was consistent with prior years. The net effect was a decline of
      approximately 17% in total LFA planners, which contributed to lower sales for
      2005 compared to 2004. If

LFA
      is
      unable to stabilize the level of planners going forward, our ability to grow
      sales could be reduced, and our ability to retain existing in-force business
      could also be adversely affected. During 2005, LFA was effective in changing
      its
      operating model thereby reducing its operating expenses to counter the reduction
      in revenues. We expect that LFA will continue the operating efficiencies it
      has
      achieved during the last year.

In
      2006,
      we expect LFD to continue to focus on strengthening its strategic alliances
      and
      increasing the number and effectiveness of wholesalers across all distribution
      channels. The pace of wholesaler expansion has a direct impact on the results
      of
      LFD, as new wholesalers generally do not reach efficient productivity until
      one
      to two years in the position.

For
      additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
      those set forth in this outlook section, see “Part I—Item 1—Risk Factors” and
“Forward-looking Statements—Cautionary Language” above.


CONSOLIDATED
      INVESTMENTS

The
      following table presents consolidated invested assets, net investment income
      and
      investment yield.

Based
                on the average of invested asset balances at the beginning and ending
                of
                each month within the year.

                of
                typical income amounts.

Investment
      Objective:

Invested
      assets are an integral part of our operations. We follow a balanced approach
      of
      investment for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis
      on generating sufficient current income to meet our obligations. This approach
      requires the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class
      utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important
      to our asset-liability management, since decisions can be made based upon both
      the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets
      and
      liabilities.

Investment
      Portfolio Composition and Diversification:

Fundamental
      to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment
      portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity
      securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate either wholly owned
      or in
      joint ventures and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for
      our
      segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that
      take into account the liabilities of the products being supported. The dominant
      investments held are fixed maturity securities available-for-sale, which
      represent approximately 77% of the investment portfolio. Trading securities,
      which are primarily fixed maturity securities, represent approximately 7.5
      % of
      the investment portfolio.

We
      have
      the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because
      of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the
      matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our
      various products.

The
      total
      investment portfolio decreased $1.3 billion in 2005 and increased $1.7 billion
      in 2004, compared to the immediately preceding year. The decrease in 2005
      resulted from a decline in the fair value of securities available-for-sale
      and
      trading securities, partially offset by purchases of investments as a result
      of
      cash flow generated by the business segment. The increase in 2004 was due to
      increases in fair value of securities available-for-sale and purchases of
      investments from the positive net flows generated by our businesses.


The
      quality of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities portfolio, as
      measured at fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities
      invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire
      available-for-sale fixed maturity security portfolio, as of December 31, 2005
      and 2004 was as follows:

The
      NAIC
      assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations called “NAIC
      Designations,” which are used by insurers when preparing their annual
      statements. The NAIC assigns designations to publicly traded as well as
      privately placed securities. The designations assigned by the NAIC range from
      class 1 to class 6, with designations in classes 1 and 2 generally considered
      investment grade.

Fixed
      maturity securities available-for-sale invested in below investment grade
      securities (NAIC designations 3 thru 6) were $2.5 billion, or 7.5%, and $2.2
      billion, or 6.2%, of all fixed maturity securities available-for-sale, as of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This represents 5.8% and 4.8% of
      the
      total investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. On
      an
      amortized cost basis, below investment grade securities represented 7.6% and
      6.2% of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Exposure
      to below investment grade securities in our investment portfolio increased
      throughout 2005. During 2005, the market experienced an increase in investment
      grade securities that have been downgraded to below investment grade (“fallen
      angels”). In 2005, the portion of our investment portfolio in below investment
      grade securities increased 1%, primarily due to fallen angels. Exposure to
      issuers with acquisitions or mergers during 2005 as well as automobile and
      airline related downgrades made up a majority of the increase in below
      investment grade securities.

Fixed
      Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios:

Fixed
      maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified
      as
      available-for-sale and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are
      included in both available-for-sale and trading portfolios.

Available-for-Sale:

Securities that are classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value
      in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and make up 91% of our investments in fixed
      maturity and equity securities. Because the general intent of the
“available-for-sale” accounting rules is to reflect shareholders’ equity as if
      unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, it is necessary that
      we
      consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a
      hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance
      sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, policyholder
      commitments and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances
      are
      charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income. For instance,
      DAC
      is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses since the
      amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on
      certain insurance business. In a similar manner, adjustments to the balances
      of
      policyholder reserves or commitments are made because we either have a
      contractual obligation or have a consistent historical practice of making
      allocations of investment gains or losses to certain policyholders. Deferred
      income tax balances are also adjusted, since unrealized gains or losses do
      not
      affect actual taxes currently paid. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
      Statements for additional information on the gross unrealized gains and losses
      as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The
      fair
      value for all private securities was $4,270 million and $4,832 million at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing 9.9% and 10.9% of total
      invested assets, respectively.

Trading
      Securities:

During
      2003, we reclassified fixed maturity and equity securities in designated
      portfolios that support modified coinsurance agreements (“Modco”) and
      coinsurance with funds withheld (“CFW”) reinsurance agreements from
      available-for-sale to trading. This was done in connection with the
      implementation of DIG B36, an accounting pronouncement which became effective
      during 2003. DIG B36 requires the recording of an embedded derivative for these
      types of arrangements. Investment results for these portfolios, including gains
      and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers through the
      contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements. Trading securities are
      carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in net income
      as
      they occur. Offsetting these amounts are corresponding changes in the fair


value
      of
      the embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance
      arrangement. See Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
      more
      information regarding our accounting for Modco.

Mortgage-Backed
      Securities:

Our
      fixed
      maturity securities include mortgage-backed securities. The mortgage-backed
      securities included in our investment portfolio are subject to risks associated
      with variable prepayments. This may result in differences between the actual
      cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of
      purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed
      by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield
      or
      a loss. Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay
      faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain. In addition,
      we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields
      earned on the securities. Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the
      opposite impact. We may incur disinvestment risks if market yields are higher
      than the book yields earned on the securities and we are forced to sell the
      securities. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or
      losses is influenced by 1) the difference between its amortized cost and par,
      2)
      the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to
      prepayment in a changing interest rate environment and 3) the repayment priority
      of the securities in the overall securitization structure.

We
      limit
      the extent of our risk on mortgage-backed securities by prudently limiting
      exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities
      with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities backed
      by
      stable collateral, and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority
      in
      their trust structure. Such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower
      yield (but higher liquidity) than higher-risk mortgage-backed securities. At
      selected times, we may purchase higher-risk securities if they do not compromise
      the safety of the general portfolio. At December 31, 2005, we did not have
      a
      significant amount of higher-risk mortgage-backed securities. There are
      negligible default risks in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio as a whole
      as the vast majority of the assets are either guaranteed by U.S.
      government-sponsored enterprises or are supported in the securitization
      structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment
      grade status. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
      detail about the underlying collateral.

Mortgage
      Loans on Real Estate and Real Estate:

The
      following summarizes key information on mortgage loans:

In
      addition to the dispersion by property type, the mortgage loan portfolio is
      geographically diversified throughout the United States. However, mortgage
      loans
      on real estate in California and Texas accounted for approximately 27% of the
      total carrying value of mortgage loans at December 31, 2005. Our exposure in
      the
      mortgage loan portfolio to Hurricanes Rita and Katrina was very limited as
      the
      total exposure in the portfolio to commercial loans secured by properties in
      the
      states of Louisiana and Mississippi was $12.3 million at December 31, 2005.
      We
      had no commercial mortgage loans secured by properties in the state of Alabama
      at December 31, 2005. All affected properties are insured for damages, including
      flood, and carry business interruption insurance.

All
      mortgage loans that are impaired have an established allowance for credit loss.
      Changing economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage loans. Changing
      vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis


that
      we
      perform for monitored loans and may contribute to changes in the allowance
      for
      credit losses. In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial
      mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of current emphasis are the
      hotel, retail, office and industrial properties that have deteriorating credits
      or have experienced debt coverage reduction. Where warranted, we have
      established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis. Impaired
      mortgage loans were 1.8% and 2.2% of total mortgage loans as December 31, 2005
      and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, all commercial
      mortgage loans were current as to principal and interest payments. See Note
      4 to
      the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail regarding impaired
      mortgage loans.

Limited
      Partnership Investments:

As of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had $312.3 million and $270.6 million,
      respectively, of limited partnership investments included in consolidated
      investments. These include investments in approximately 54 different
      partnerships that allow us to gain exposure to a broadly diversified portfolio
      of asset classes such as venture capital, hedge funds, and oil and gas. The
      partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve
      several third-party partners. Select partnerships contain “capital calls” which
      require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner.
      These
      capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are
      planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material
      in size and pose no threat to our liquidity. The capital calls are included
      on
      the table of contingent commitments in “Liquidity and Capital Resources -
      Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.” Limited partnership
      investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and the
      majority of these investments are included in other investments in the
      Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Net
      Investment Income:

Net
      investment income decreased in 2005 compared to 2004. Excluding contingent
      interest, commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and
      fees received from the standby real estate equity commitments financing program,
      the favorable effect of asset growth from net flows was more than offset by
      declining portfolio yields. The decline in yields was due to lower interest
      rates on new securities purchased to replace matured securities and new
      securities purchased from net product deposits into the portfolio. Net
      investment income increased slightly in 2004 when compared to 2003. The
      favorable effects of asset growth from net flows, partnership income and
      prepayment and makewhole premiums were substantially offset by a declining
      portfolio yield, due to lower interest rates on new securities purchased as
      assets matured and net product sales flowed into the portfolio.

The
      following discussion addresses our invested assets excluding trading account
      securities. As discussed above, investment results attributable to the trading
      securities are passed to the reinsurers under the terms of the reinsurance
      arrangements.

Realized
      Gains and Losses on Investments and Derivative Instruments:

We had
      net pre-tax realized losses on investments and derivatives of $22.1 million,
      $57.2 million and $19.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Prior
      to
      the amortization of DAC, provision for policyholder commitments and investment
      expenses, pre-tax realized gains (losses) were $37.9 million, $1.8 million
      and
      ($7.4 million) in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
      gross
      realized gains on fixed maturity and equity securities were $122.9 million,
      $136.1 million and $364.5 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross
      realized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $93.2 million,
      $123.3 million and $396.8 million, respectively. Included in losses for fixed
      maturities and equity securities are write-downs for impairments of $20.1
      million, $67.9 million and $252.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
      impairment losses in 2005 were primarily attributable to airline securities.
      Overcapacity in the market, labor issues and high fuel costs plagued the legacy
      domestic airlines throughout 2004 and 2005. In 2004, while losses from sales
      and
      impairments occurred in a number of sectors, approximately 36.4 % of gross
      realized losses were attributable to the airline sector. As a result of the
      continued deterioration in the sector, these securities were written down.
      In
      2004, some of the previously impaired securities were later sold for a gain.

We
      consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries
      where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of
      securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for
      realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other
      investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation
      risks
      and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified,
      strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these
      risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are
      risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets,
      risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.

Unrealized
      Gains and Losses—Available-for-Sale Securities:

When
      considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to realize
      that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point
      in time, and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios
      subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, since the timing


of
      the
      recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of
      which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important
      to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall
      unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are
      important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the
      potential impact of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings. At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, gross unrealized gains on securities
      available-for-sale were $1,379.9 million and $2,035.8 million, respectively,
      and
      gross unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale were $312.9 million
      and
      $135.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005, gross unrealized gains
      and
      losses on fixed maturity securities available-for-sale were $1,371.4 million
      and
      $312.2 million, respectively, and gross unrealized gains and losses on equity
      securities available-for-sale were $8.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively.
      At December 31, 2004, gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity
      securities available-for-sale were $2,020.0 million and $134.8 million,
      respectively, and gross unrealized gains and losses on equity securities
      available-for-sale were $15.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Changes
      in
      unrealized gains and losses can be attributed to changes in interest rates
      and
      credit spreads, which have created temporary price fluctuations.

Where
      detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers
      leads
      to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other than
      temporary, the security is written down to fair value. In instances where
      declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully
      monitored. See “Critical Accounting Policies—Investments—Write-downs for
      Other-Than Temporary Impairments and Allowance for Losses” for additional
      information.

For
      publicly-traded and private securities that we held at December 31, 2005 and
      2004 that were subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes
      in unrealized loss status, the fair value, amortized cost, unrealized loss
      and
      total time period that the security has been in an unrealized loss position
      are
      presented in the table below.


For
      total
      publicly traded and private securities that we held at December 31, 2005 and
      2004 that were in unrealized loss status, the fair value, amortized cost,
      unrealized loss and total time period that the security has been in an
      unrealized loss position are presented in the table below.

We
          have
          no concentrations of issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity and equity
          securities. The composition by industry categories of securities subject
          to
          enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss
          status, that we held at December 31, 2005 and 2004 is presented in the
          table
          below.


The
      composition by industry categories of all securities in unrealized loss status,
      which we held at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are presented in the table below.


Unrealized
      Loss on All Below-Investment-Grade Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturity
      Securities:

Gross
      unrealized losses on all available-for-sale below-investment-grade securities
      were $92.0 million at December 31, 2005, representing 29.4% of total gross
      unrealized losses on all available-for-sale securities. Generally,
      below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities are more likely than
      investment-grade securities to develop credit concerns. The remaining $220.9
      million or 70.6% of the gross unrealized losses relate to investment grade
      available-for-sale securities. The ratios of market value to amortized cost
      reflected in the table below are not necessarily indicative of the market value
      to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire time
      that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they
      necessarily indicative of these ratios subsequent to December 31, 2005.


For
      fixed
      maturity securities that we held at December 31, 2005 and 2004 that are below
      investment grade and in an unrealized loss position, the fair value, amortized
      cost, unrealized loss and the ratios of market value to amortized cost are
      presented in the table below.


At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, less than 0.5% and 5.8%, respectively, of the
      publicly traded and private securities held that were subject to enhanced
      analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss status were
      rated as investment grade. At December 31, 2005, the range of maturity dates
      for
      these securities varies, with 36.9% of these securities maturing between 5
      and
      10 years, 47.7% maturing in greater than 10 years and the remaining securities
      maturing in less than 5 years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, 92.6% and 91.2%,
      respectively, of total publicly traded and private securities in unrealized
      loss
      status were rated as investment grade. At December 31, 2005, the range of
      maturity dates for these securities varies, with about 31% maturing between
      and 10 years, 51% maturing after 10 years and the remaining securities maturing
      in less than 5 years. At December 31, 2004, the range of maturity dates for
      these securities varies, with about 30% maturing between 5 and 10 years, 46%
      maturing after 10 years and the remaining securities maturing in less than
      years. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for ratings and
      maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, gross unrealized losses totaled $312.9 million compared
      to
      $135.3 million at December 31, 2004. We expect an ultimate recovery of full
      principal and interest of our securities with unrealized losses.

The
      automotive sector represented 14.3% of our gross unrealized loss at December
      31,
      2005. The Big 3 auto manufacturers have experienced pressure throughout 2005
      from overseas manufacturers. Pension issues, declining market share and higher
      commodity pricing all contributed to spread widening in the sector. Our
      automotive holdings are made up of both coupon-bearing and zero-coupon
      instruments. Unrealized losses on zero-coupon bonds made up 40% of the total
      automotive gross unrealized loss. Market prices on zero-coupon bonds are more
      sensitive to spread changes than coupon-bearing bonds.

Unrealized
      Loss on Fixed Maturity Securities Available-for-Sale in Excess of $10
      million:

At
      December 31, 2005, we had no investment grade available-for-sale fixed maturity
      securities with unrealized losses in excess of $10 million. At December 31,
      fixed maturity securities available-for-sale with gross unrealized losses
      greater than $10 million are presented in the table below.

At
      December 31, 2005, our total available-for-sale holdings in Ford Motor and
      its
      affiliates and securities it guarantees had a fair value of $36.5 million and
      an
      amortized cost of $57.5 million. In addition, at December 31, 2005, we held
      fixed maturity securities available-for-sale of General Motors Corp. and
      affiliates with fair value of $75.3 million and amortized cost of $79.4 million.
      Our total gross unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities for these
      two
      companies was $28.5 million.

The
      information presented above is subject to rapidly changing conditions. As such,
      we expect that the level of securities with overall unrealized losses will
      fluctuate, as will the level of unrealized loss securities that are subject
      to
      enhanced analysis and monitoring. The volatility of financial market conditions
      results in increased recognition of both investment gains and losses, as
      portfolio risks are adjusted through sales and purchases. As discussed below,
      this is consistent with our classification of our investment portfolios as
      available-for-sale.

During
      2005 and 2004, we sold securities for gains and losses. As discussed earlier,
      in
      the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects
      declines that are other than temporary, we consider our ability and intent
      to
      hold the security until its value recovers. However, subsequent decisions on
      securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring,
      assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio
      maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time,
      believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with
      unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered,
      the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision
      to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification
      of
      our investment portfolio as available-for-sale. We expect to continue to manage
      all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is
      consistent with the available-for-sale classification.


REINSURANCE

Our
      insurance companies cede insurance to other companies. The portion of risks
      exceeding each company’s retention limit is reinsured with other insurers. We
      seek reinsurance coverage within the businesses that sell life insurance to
      limit our exposure to mortality losses and enhance our capital management.
      We
      reinsure approximately 85% to 90% of the mortality risk on newly issued life
      insurance contracts. Our policy is to retain no more than $5.0 million on a
      single insured life issued on fixed and variable universal life insurance
      contracts. Additionally, the retention per single insured life for term life
      insurance and for Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI) is $1 million and $2
      million, respectively. Beginning in September 2005, we changed our reinsurance
      program for our primary term products from coinsurance to renewable term and
      from 90% to 80% on a first dollar quota share basis. In January 2006, we changed
      this program from 80% first dollar quota share to an excess of retention
      program.

In
      a
      coinsurance program, the reinsurer shares proportionately in all financial
      terms
      of the reinsured policies, i.e. premiums, expenses, claims, etc. based on their
      respective quota share of the risk. In a renewable term program, the reinsurer
      is paid a renewable term premium to cover the proportionate share of mortality
      risk assumed by the reinsurer. In a first dollar quota share program, the
      reinsurer receives a proportionate share of all risks issued based on their
      respective quota share of the risk. In an excess of retention program, the
      reinsurer assumes a proportionate share of risks that exceed our per life
      retention.

These
      changes have the effect of reducing premiums paid to reinsurers while increasing
      our exposure to mortality losses, and could result in more volatility in results
      for our Life Insurance segment.

W

ith
      respect to annuities, we have previously reinsured a portion of our fixed
      annuity business, but beginning in 2004, we have retained the full risk on
      newly
      issued contracts.

Portions
      of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a Modco basis with
      other
      companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks. At December 31, 2005,
      the reserves associated with these reinsurance arrangements totaled $2.2
      billion. To cover products other than life insurance, we acquire other insurance
      coverages with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate
      for the circumstances. The accompanying financial statements reflect premiums,
      benefits and deferred acquisition costs, net of insurance ceded. See “Part
      I—Item 1—Risk Factors,” “Forward-looking Statements—Cautionary Language” and
      Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Our
      insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet
      contractual obligations under applicable reinsurance agreements.

Our
      amounts recoverable from reinsurers represents receivables from and reserves
      ceded to reinsurers. We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers
      and monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal
      reinsurers. Our principal reinsurers are strongly rated companies, with Swiss
      Re
      representing the largest exposure. In 2001, we sold our reinsurance business
      to
      Swiss Re primarily through indemnity reinsurance arrangements. Because we are
      not relieved of our liability to the ceding companies for this business, the
      liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured contracts remain
      on
      our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable
      from
      the business sold to Swiss Re, which totaled $4.1 billion at December 31, 2005,
      and is included in amounts recoverable from reinsurers. Swiss Re has funded
      a
      trust, with a balance of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2005, to support this
      business.

In
      addition to various remedies that we would have in the event of a default by
      Swiss Re, we continue to hold assets in support of certain of the transferred
      reserves. These assets consist of those reported as trading securities and
      certain mortgage loans. Our liabilities for funds withheld and embedded
      derivatives at December 31, 2005 included $2.0 billion and $0.2 billion,
      respectively, related to the business sold to Swiss Re through indemnity
      reinsurance.


REVIEW
      OF CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity

and Capital Resources

Liquidity
      refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash
      from
      its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety.
      Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance
      premiums and fees, investment advisory fees and investment income, while sources
      of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of
      invested assets. We use cash to pay policy claims and benefits, operating
      expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, pay dividends
      to
      our shareholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities. Our operating
      activities provided cash of $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $0.9 billion in
      2005,
      2004 and 2003, respectively.

When
      considering our liquidity and cash flow it is important to distinguish between
      the needs of our insurance subsidiaries, including The Lincoln National Life
      Insurance Company (“LNL”), our principal insurance subsidiary, and the needs of
      the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own,
      LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.

The
      liquidity resources of the holding company are principally comprised of
      dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries augmented by holding company
      short-term investments, bank lines of credit, a commercial paper program, and
      the ongoing availability of long-term financing under an SEC shelf registration.
      These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs
      of
      the holding company including its common stock dividends, interest and debt
      service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, and
      acquisitions.

Sources
      of Liquidity and Cash Flow

The
      following table summarizes the primary sources of holding company cash flow.
      The
      table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the
      effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and
      retirement of debt and cash flows related to our intercompany cash management
      account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing
      agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net
      cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the
      modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding
      company. See “Part IV—Item 15(a)(2) Financial Statement Schedules—Schedule
      II—LNC Parent Company Only Statement of Cash Flows” in this Form 10-K for the
      parent company cash flow statement.

Prior
                to 2004, we invested in a variable annuity contract with investment
                options similar to the investment options within the unfunded deferred
                compensation plan. The purpose of this investment was to partially
                mitigate the earnings effects created by changes in the value of
                our
                deferred compensation plan liability that resulted from changes in
                value
                of the underlying investment options. In June 2004, we withdrew the
                variable annuity contract from LNL, which had a value of $65.4 million,
                and entered into a total return swap agreement. The swap mitigates
                the
                impact that increases in the value of the underlying investment tracking
                options would have on our cash flow when we make distributions to
                participants.


Subsidiaries

Because
      of the interval of time from receipt of deposits or premiums until payment
      of
      benefits or claims, LNL and other insurers employ investment portfolios as
      an
      integral element of operations. By segmenting its investment portfolios along
      product lines, LNL enhances the focus and discipline it can apply to managing
      the liquidity, as well as the interest rate and credit risk of each portfolio
      commensurate with the profile of the related product liabilities. For example,
      portfolios backing products with less certain cash flows and/or withdrawal
      provisions are generally kept more liquid than portfolios backing products
      with
      more predictable cash flows. LNL monitors its liquidity position via weekly
      conference calls between the product actuaries and investment portfolio
      managers. Additionally, the liquidity position and liquidity targets by
      portfolio are reviewed on a regular basis by our Asset-Liability Committee,
      which includes our actuarial and asset management professionals and is chaired
      by LNL’s Appointed Actuary. The Committee utilizes various measures of
      liquidity, including liquidity ratios (measure of liquid assets to liquid
      liabilities) and more comprehensive liquidity studies, to monitor the insurance
      company’s liquidity at specific points in time. LNL sets target levels for each
      of these measures consistent with current ratings. Quarterly, LNL computes
      the
      estimated rating agency measures versus targets and reviews potential action
      steps as needed.

The
      asset-liability management process is more concentrated within the annuity
      blocks of business given market-sensitive liabilities. The retail and
      employer-sponsored orientation of our core products reduces liquidity risk,
      as
      liabilities tend to be less sensitive to movements in the markets. We do not
      manufacture or distribute institutional spread products, such as guaranteed
      investment contracts, the direct sale of funding agreements or the issuance
      of
      medium term notes secured by insurance company funding agreements.

Capital
      considerations for LNL are impacted by factors influencing LNL’s risk-based
      capital (“RBC”) and statutory earnings performance. The most common measure of
      RBC is the NAIC RBC formula. The NAIC RBC formula requires a company to hold
      minimum capital against the quality and liquidity of assets, insurance risk,
      interest rate risk, and general business risk. LNL currently targets a NAIC
      RBC
      ratio of three times the NAIC’s defined Company Action Level. The Company Action
      Level is the minimum level of capital required before necessitating a plan
      of
      action filed with the regulators. We believe LNL’s target is consistent with
      maintaining or increasing LNL’s current financial strength ratings. We monitor
      RBC and other key financial ratio targets as the company’s risk profile,
      environmental conditions, and/or rating agency views of industry risk change.
      In
      addition, merger and acquisition activity may give rise to short-term
      fluctuations in RBC and other key financial ratios. At December 31, 2005, LNL’s
      reported NAIC RBC was 437% of Company Action Level. For further information
      on
      RBC ratios, see “Part I—Item 1 -Business—Regulatory Matters—Risk-Based Capital.”

In
      addition, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department
      regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends
      to
      the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance
      subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends
      to LNC only from unassigned surplus, without prior approval of the Indiana
      Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), or must receive prior approval of
      the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other
      dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months, would exceed
      the
      statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of (i)
      10%
      of the insurer’s policyholders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement
      on file with the Commissioner or (ii) the insurer’s statutory net gain from
      operations for the previous twelve months, but in no event to exceed statutory
      unassigned surplus. Indiana law gives Commissioner broad discretion to
      disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits.

It
      is
      important to note that, regardless of the particular state regulations, we
      take
      into account the overall health of the business, capital quality, and business
      and environmental risk in determining statutory dividend strategy.

      LNL Dividend Capacity:

LNL had
      positive earned surplus of $483 million at December 31, 2005 and a statutory
      net
      gain of $468 million in 2005. Based upon anticipated on-going positive statutory
      net gain and stable credit markets, LNL expects to be able to pay up to $468
      million in dividends to LNC in 2006 without prior approval from the
      Commissioner.

Our
      UL
      LPR products and certain other products are subject to Actuarial Guideline
      (also known as “AXXX”) and XXX reserving requirements. GAAP reserves are not
      subject to AXXX and XXX statutory reserving requirements. In October 2005,
      the
      NAIC adopted a change to AXXX with an effective date of July 1, 2005. The
      proposal does not affect business written prior to the effective date of July
      1,
      2005. Application of this guideline to sales of UL products with


secondary
      guarantees subsequent to July 1 resulted in an increase to statutory reserves
      of
      approximately $90 million, which reduced statutory surplus by approximately
      $65
      million at December 31, 2005. There was no impact to GAAP reserves, and
      accordingly, no effect on results of operations. We continue to evaluate
      potential modifications to our universal life products with secondary guarantees
      that may be made in response to the revised regulation. Although the impact
      of
      this proposal on future sales of guaranteed no-lapse UL cannot be predicted,
      it
      may result in a price increase for such products. Although this will not have
      a
      material impact on cash flows to LNC, LNL is employing strategies to lessen
      the
      burden of increased statutory reserves associated with these statutory reserving
      requirements. Strategies include a mix of letters of credit (“LOC”), reinsurance
      and capital markets solutions that provide for risk transfer and associated
      reserve and surplus relief. A portion of LPR business is reinsured with a wholly
      owned non-U.S. domiciled subsidiary of LNC.

      and 2004 LNL Dividends:

LNL paid
      dividends of $200.0 million and $150.0 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively,
      which did not require prior approval of the Commissioner.

      LNL Dividends:

During
      2003, LNL had to receive prior approval from the Commissioner to pay dividends
      as a result of having negative statutory earned surplus. LNL paid dividends
      of
      $200 million to LNC, which were classified as a reduction to paid-in-capital.
      Statutory earnings for 2003, together with a reduced dividend payment, resulted
      in a positive earned surplus position at December 31, 2003.

Under
      prior Federal income tax law, one-half of the excess of a life insurance
      company’s income from operations over its taxable investment income was not
      taxed, but was set aside in a special tax account designated as “Policyholders’
Surplus.” On October 23, 2004, President Bush signed into law the “American Jobs
      Creation Act of 2004.” In 2005 and 2006, the additional tax imposed on
      distributions from the special tax account, “Policyholders Surplus, ” is
      suspended. In addition, the statute provides that distributions made during
      the
      two-year suspension period will first reduce the Policyholders Surplus account
      balance. LNL’s dividend activity for 2005 was sufficient to eliminate the
      account balance during the suspension period.

As
      a
      result of being an accredited reinsurer in New York, LNL is also an authorized
      insurer in the state of New York. As such, LNL is subject to the regulatory
      requirements imposed by New York on authorized insurers. One such requirement
      is
      that LNL must report to New York its reserves based on New York reserving
      regulations, which are generally more conservative than those of Indiana, thus
      reducing LNL’s total adjusted capital as reported to New York. See “Part I—Item
      1—Business—Regulatory—Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments
      Regulatory Matters” for further information.

Lincoln
      UK’s operations consist primarily of unit-linked life and pension products,
      which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products. Lincoln
      UK’s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the U.K. Financial Services
      Authority (“FSA”) and are subject to capital requirements as defined by the U.K.
      Capital Resources Requirement (formerly the Required Minimum Solvency Margin).
      Lincoln UK targets maintaining approximately 1.5 to 2.0 times the required
      capital as prescribed by the regulatory resource requirement. Effective January
      1, 2005, all insurance companies operating in the U.K have to complete an RBC
      assessment to demonstrate to the FSA that they hold sufficient capital to cover
      their risks. RBC requirements in the U.K. are different than the NAIC
      requirements. In addition, the FSA imposes certain minimum capital requirements
      for the combined U.K. subsidiaries that further restrict Lincoln UK’s ability to
      pay dividends. Lincoln UK paid dividends of $44.3 million in 2005. As is the
      case with regulated insurance companies in the U.S., future changes to
      regulatory capital requirements could impact the dividend capacity of our U.K.
      insurance subsidiaries and cash flow to the holding company.

Financing
      Activities

Although
      our subsidiaries generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal
      operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to fund internal
      growth, acquisitions, and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.
      At
      December 31, 2005, we had $600 million of remaining authorization to issue
      various securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock,
      warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of LNC and trust
      preferred securities of four subsidiary trusts under an existing shelf
      registration. In November 2005, our Board of Directors increased our
      authorization allowing us to issue up to $4 billion of securities, which
      includes the $600 million of remaining authorization, under a new shelf
      registration statement filed in March 2006. As discussed previously, we plan
      to
      finance the anticipated 2006 merger with Jefferson-Pilot through a combination
      of long-term debt or other securities. We expect to utilize bridge financing
      in
      the event that permanent financing cannot be completed before the closing,
      which
      is described below. In addition to the merger, the net proceeds from the sale
      of
      the securities offered by the existing shelf registration and any additional
      shelf registration are expected to be used for general corporate purposes,
      including repurchases of outstanding common stock, repayment or redemption
      of
      outstanding debt or preferred stock, the possible acquisition of other financial
      services businesses or assets thereof, and working capital


needs.
      Cash funds are also available from our revolving credit agreements and through
      our commercial paper program. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
      Statements for information on our debt.

The
      following summarizes debt and financing activity during 2005, 2004 and 2003.

      February 2006, we entered into a new credit agreement (the “2006 Credit
      Agreement”) with a group of banks, which expires in 2011, that allows for
      borrowing or issuance of letters of credit of up to $1.0 billion. In December
      2005, we entered into a new credit agreement (the “Bridge Facility”) with a
      group of banks to provide for borrowings of up to $2.3 billion in connection
      with our merger with Jefferson-Pilot and planned share repurchase. The Bridge
      Facility is a 364-day facility. Specifically, if we make a drawdown under the
      Bridge Facility, we may only use the proceeds of the loan to pay up to $1.8
      billion to shareholders of Jefferson-Pilot in connection with our previously
      announced merger with Jefferson-Pilot, which represents the aggregate cash
      portion of the merger consideration, and/or to repurchase up to $500 million
      of
      our common stock.

At
      December 31, 2005, we maintained two revolving credit agreements with a group
      of
      domestic and foreign banks: a $500 million five-year revolving credit facility
      maturing in December 2009 and a U.K. facility, which was renewed in January
      for 10 million pounds sterling ($17 million at December 31, 2005) maturing
      in
      November 2006. At December 31, 2005, we did not have any amounts outstanding
      under any of the bank lines.

Effective
      December 2004, we amended our existing letter of credit facility. Under the
      revised letter of credit facility, we (or our subsidiaries) may request the
      issuance of up to $900 million in standby LOC’s. The LOC facility expires in
      December 2009. At December 31, 2005, there were $848.5 million in outstanding
      LOCs. These LOCs support intercompany reinsurance transactions and specific
      treaties associated with our former Reinsurance segment, which was acquired
      by
      Swiss Re in 2001. LOCs are primarily used to satisfy the U.S. regulatory
      requirements of domestic clients of the former Reinsurance segment who have
      contracted with the reinsurance subsidiaries not domiciled in the United States
      and for the reserve credit provided by our affiliated offshore reinsurance
      company to our domestic insurance companies for ceded business.

Under
      the
      credit agreements, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth level,
      and,
      except under the Bridge Facility and the 2006 Credit Agreement, if our senior,
      unsecured long-term debt rating is not at least A- from Standard and Poor’s or
      A3 from Moody’s then we also must maintain a defined maximum debt to total
      capitalization ratio. In addition, the agreements contain covenants restricting
      our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where
      we
      are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our
      assets. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all such covenants.
      All
      of our credit agreements are unsecured.

If
      current debt ratings and claims paying ratings were downgraded in the future,
      certain covenants of various contractual obligations may be triggered which
      could negatively impact overall liquidity. In addition, contractual selling
      agreements with intermediaries could be negatively impacted which could have
      an
      adverse impact on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment
      products. At December 31, 2005, we maintained adequate current financial
      strength and senior debt ratings and do not anticipate any ratings-based impact
      to future liquidity.


As
      discussed above, LNL is employing strategies to lessen the burden of increased
      AXXX and XXX statutory reserves associated with our LPR product and other
      products subject to these statutory reserving requirements. Currently, a portion
      of LPR business is reinsured with a wholly owned non-U.S. domiciled subsidiary
      of LNC. At December 31, 2005, there were approximately $545 million in
      outstanding LOCs under the LOC facility supporting the reinsurance obligations
      of our non-U.S. domiciled subsidiary to LNL on this LPR business. Recognizing
      that LOCs are generally one to five years in duration, it is likely LNL will
      apply a mix of LOCs, reinsurance, and capital market strategies in addressing
      long-term AXXX and XXX needs. The changes in statutory reserving requirements
      for LPR products sold after July 1, 2005 resulted in an increase of
      approximately $89 million in our outstanding LOCs at the end of 2005. LOCs
      and
      related capital market alternatives lower the RBC impact of the LPR product.
      An
      inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market
      alternatives could impact our returns on the LPR product.

During
      2005, we established a wholly-owned domestic reinsurance subsidiary to reinsure
      a portion of the XXX statutory reserves associated with our term products in
      anticipation of employing a capital markets solution to mitigate the impact
      of
      our term products to statutory capital and surplus in 2007. No reserves were
      ceded to this new subsidiary as of December 31, 2005.

Divestitures

In
      September 2004, we sold DIAL to the unit’s management group and an unaffiliated
      investor. We received $180.9 million in cash, of which $141.5 million was
      dividended to the holding company, and relief of certain obligations of
      approximately $19.0 million. We used the funds for general corporate purposes,
      including repurchase of shares and repayment of debt.

Alternative
      Sources of Liquidity

In
      order
      to maximize the use of available cash, the holding company maintains an
      intercompany cash management account where subsidiaries can borrow from the
      holding company to meet their short-term needs and can invest their short-term
      funds with the holding company. Depending on the overall cash availability
      or
      need, the holding company invests excess cash in short-term investments or
      borrows funds in the financial markets. LNL, by virtue of its general account
      fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities
      lending programs and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2005, LNL had $932.7
      million of securities out on loan under the securities lending program.

Uses
      of Capital

Return
      of Capital to Shareholders

One
      of
      the holding company’s principal uses of cash is to provide a return to our
      shareholders. Through dividends and stock repurchases, we have an established
      record of providing significant cash returns to our shareholders. We have
      increased our dividend in each of the last 22 years. In determining our dividend
      payout, we balance the desire to increase the dividend against capital needs,
      rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The
      following table summarizes this activity:

The
      remaining amount of share repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors
      was
      $221.6 million at December 31, 2005. In January 2006, our Board of Directors
      approved a $1.6 billion increase in the share repurchase authorization, bringing
      the total authorization to $1.8 billion. We suspended our stock repurchase
      program during 2003 and focused on building capital and protecting our strong
      credit ratings after experiencing difficult capital market conditions in 2002.
      In 2004, we reactivated our share repurchase program. We expect to repurchase
      approximately $500 million of LNC common stock as soon as practicable after
      the
      completion of our merger with Jefferson-Pilot. In addition, we expect to
      continue share repurchases in 2006 with the amount and timing dependent on
      trends in key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of
      free
      cash flow, and the relative attractiveness of alternative uses for the capital.


The
      following table summarizes the primary uses of holding company cash flow. The
      table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the
      effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of
      debt
      and cash flows related to our intercompany cash management account. Taxes have
      been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our
      primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net cash flows at the
      holding company.

At
          the
          end of 2004, LNC made a $100 million capital contribution to LNL. LNC was
          in a
          strong capital position at year-end 2005 and our preference is to hold
          capital
          at LNL.

Contractual
          Obligations

The
          table
          below summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments
          under
          contracts and contingent commitments in place at December 31,
          2005.

In
      addition to the contractual commitments outlined in the table above, we
      periodically fund the employees’ defined benefit plans. We contributed $18.0
      million, $34.1 million and 56.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively
      to
      U.S. pension plans and approximately $77 million in 2005 to our U.K. pension
      plan, including approximately $71 million in the fourth quarter. We expect
      to
      contribute between $0 and $19 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans
      and $7.1 million to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2006. These
      amounts include anticipated benefit payments for non-qualified plans. The
      majority of contributions/benefit payments are made at the insurance company
      subsidiary level with little holding company cash flow impact. See Note 8 to
      the
      Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.


Contingencies
      and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The
      table
      below summarizes our contingent commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements
      at December 31, 2005.

(1)

Total
                includes $339.5 million of capital commitments on limited partnership
                investments, $102.8 million and $84.1 million of commitments for
                private
                placement securities and mortgage loans, respectively.

(2)

Recourse
                provisions exist enabling us to recover from third parties any amounts
                paid under the guarantees.

For
      additional information regarding contingencies, see Note 9 to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements.

Significant
      Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow

As
      stated
      above, LNC, as a holding company has its cash flow driven largely by the
      dividend capacity and surplus note interest payments of LNL. LNL’s dividend
      capacity is impacted by factors influencing LNL’s risk- based capital and
      statutory earnings performance. In recent periods, Delaware Investments and
      our
      U.K. operations have contributed significant free cash flow. Improved financial
      performance at Delaware and our decision to run-off significant blocks of
      business in the U.K. are driving improved cash flow and the return of capital
      to
      LNC. We expect to have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our
      obligations in 2006. For factors that could effect our expectations for
      liquidity and capital, see “Part I—Item 1—Business—Risk Factors.”

Shareholders’
Equity

Total
      shareholders’ equity increased $208.8 million during 2005, primarily due to net
      income, partially offset by dividends to shareholders, share repurchases and
      unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities.

As
      noted
      above, shareholders’ equity includes accumulated other comprehensive income. At
      December 31, 2005, the book value of $36.69 per share included $3.03 of
      accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2004, the book value
      of
      $35.53 per share included $5.36 of accumulated other comprehensive income.


OTHER
      MATTERS

Other
      Factors Affecting Our Business

In
      general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal,
      legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives
      to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries, to make
      permanent recent reductions in individual tax rates, to permanently repeal
      the
      estate tax and to increase regulation of our annuity and investment management
      businesses. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment
      in
      which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a
      material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.
      See “Part I—Item 1—Business—Risk Factors” and “—Forward-Looking
      Statements—Cautionary Language” for factors that may cause our future results to
      differ materially from current expectations.

Sale
      of Delaware London-based International Investment Unit

In
      September 2004, we sold DIAL to the unit’s management group and an unaffiliated
      investor. We received $180.9 million in cash, of which $141.5 million was
      dividended to the holding company, and relief of certain obligations of
      approximately $19.0 million. Our after-tax gain from the transaction was $46.1
      million. We used the funds for general corporate purposes, including of debt
      repayment and share repurchases. The Investment Management segment’s results for
      2004 included approximately $12.4 million of income related to DIAL. The sale
      resulted in a reduction of $22.1 billion in the Investment Management segment’s
      assets under management at the time of the sale. As of December 31, 2005,
      approximately $16.4 billion of the Investment Management segment’s remaining
      assets under management are being sub-advised on our behalf by the acquirer.

RESTRUCTURING
      ACTIVITIES

We
      have
      initiated and executed restructuring plans of various sizes as summarized below.
      These restructuring plans generally are initiated to improve the efficiency
      of
      our operations. Although we have experienced a number of restructuring charges,
      management reviews the results of operations of each business segment excluding
      these restructuring charges because management believes that restructuring
      charges are not part of the underlying business of our segments. Below is a
      summary of the restructuring charges initiated by year. Restructuring plans
      initiated in 2003 contain charges recognized in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Additional
      details of each of these restructuring plans are discussed in Note 14 to the
      Consolidated Financial Statements.


In
      January 2003, the Life Insurance segment announced that it was realigning its
      operations in Hartford, Connecticut and Schaumburg, Illinois to enhance
      productivity, efficiency and scalability while positioning the segment for
      future growth. In February 2003, Lincoln Retirement announced plans to
      consolidate its fixed annuity operations in Schaumburg, Illinois into Fort
      Wayne, Indiana. In June 2003, we announced the combining of our retirement
      and
      life insurance businesses into a single operating unit focused on providing
      wealth accumulation and protection, income distribution and wealth transfer
      products. In August 2003, we announced additional realignment activities, which
      impact all of our domestic operations. These realignment activities are expected
      to result in total charges of $127.0 million. The realignment activities are
      expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2006.

Pre-tax
      restructuring charges for the June/August 2003 realignment activities for 2005
      by segment were as follows: Retirement ($17.4 million), Life Insurance ($3.3
      million), and Other Operations ($0.7 million). Pre-tax restructuring charges
      for
      the June/August realignment activities for 2004 were as follows: Retirement
      ($6.2 million), Life Insurance ($0.6 million), Investment Management ($1.6
      million), and Other Operations ($9.9 million).

      and 2000 Restructuring Plans

During
      1999 and 2000, we implemented restructuring plans relating to the Lincoln UK’s
      operations. In addition to various other activities, these plans involved
      vacating leased facilities. All other plan activities have been completed and
      the remaining reserves relate to future lease payments on exited properties,
      which run through 2016. The remaining reserves for these plans totaled $6.3
      million at December 31, 2005.

.
      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We
      analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial
      instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management
      process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential
      effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review
      and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We
      have
      exposures to several market risks including interest rate, default risk, foreign
      currency exchange, liquidity and equity price risks.

The
      exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk
      management processes, are most important in the Lincoln Retirement and Life
      Insurance segments, where most of the invested assets support accumulation
      and
      investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our
      integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to minimize
      the effects of changes in interest levels and the shape of the yield curve.
      In
      this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to reduce interest
      rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates
      on
      our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account
      insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. The
      primary sources of market risk are: 1) substantial, relatively rapid and
      sustained increases or decreases in interest rates, 2) fluctuations in currency
      exchange rates or 3) a sharp drop in equity market values. Each of these market
      risks is discussed in detail in the following pages.

Interest
      Rate Risk

Accumulation
      and Investment Oriented Insurance Products.

General
      account assets supporting accumulation and investment-oriented insurance
      products total $33.7 billion, or approximately 78%, of total invested assets
      and
      $34.5 billion, or approximately 78%, of total invested assets at December 31,
      2005 and 2004, respectively.

With
      respect to these products, we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread,
      or
      margin, between investment income and interest credited to account values.
      If we
      have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers,
      our spreads are reduced. Alternatively, we may seek to maintain spreads by
      reducing crediting rates, where permissible, which may result in crediting
      rates
      that are not competitive in the market place. This strategy could result in
      adverse surrender experience on policies and could force us to liquidate a
      portion of our portfolio to fund cash surrender value benefits.

Provided
      interest rates continue to gradually return to levels that are more typical
      from
      a long-term perspective, we do not view the near term risk to spreads over
      the
      next twelve months to be material. The combination of a probable range of
      interest rate changes over the next twelve months, asset-liability management
      strategies, flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection
      afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together
      to mitigate this risk. The interest rate scenarios of concern are those in
      which
      there is a substantial, relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates
      that is then sustained over a long period.


Fixed
      Deferred Annuities.

Assets
      of $20.2 billion and $21.4 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
      support the largest category of accumulation and investment oriented insurance
      products, fixed deferred annuities. For these products, we may adjust renewal
      crediting rates monthly or quarterly, subject to guaranteed minimums ranging
      from 1.5% to 5.0%. The higher minimums apply to in-force blocks of older
      products that no longer are sold. Annuity customers have the right to surrender
      their policies at account value less a surrender charge that grades to zero
      over
      periods ranging from 5 to 10 years from policy issue date or, in some cases,
      the
      date of each premium received. In some cases, a market value adjustment may
      also
      apply. Due to our ability to change crediting rates to reflect investment
      experience on the majority of our traditional annuity products, the underlying
      assets are assumed to be a good proxy for the interest rate risk inherent in
      these liabilities. This assumption is appropriate for probable movements in
      interest rates over the next twelve months. This assumption may not be
      appropriate for a substantial, relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest
      rates that is then sustained over a long period.

Universal
      Life and Interest-Sensitive Whole Life.

We had
      $11.6 billion and $11.1 billion in assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively, supporting universal life and interest-sensitive whole life
      insurance on which we have the right to adjust renewal crediting rates. The
      credited rates are subject to guaranteed minimums ranging from 3.0% to 4.5%
      for
      universal life and 4.0% to 7.0% for interest-sensitive whole life at December
      31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, 83% of these assets support universal life
      insurance products. Similar to annuities, universal life insurance customers
      have the right to surrender their policies at account value less a surrender
      charge that grades to zero over periods ranging from ten to twenty years from
      policy issue date or, in some cases, the date of each premium received.

Group
      Pension Annuities and Guaranteed Interest Contracts.

We had
      assets totaling $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively, that support group pension immediate and deferred annuities and
      guaranteed interest contracts. Generally, the cash flows expected on these
      liabilities do not vary with fluctuations in market interest rates and are
      not
      adjustable by us. Accordingly, if experience on the assets supporting these
      products is more adverse than the assumptions used in pricing the products,
      spreads will tend to be below expectations. We limit exposure to interest rate
      risk by managing the duration and maturity structure of each investment
      portfolio in relation to the liabilities it supports. We had no guaranteed
      investment contracts supported by these assets at December 31, 2005, compared
      to
      approximately $29 million at December 31, 2004.

Other
      General Account Insurance Products.

We had
      $9.5 billion and $10.0 billion of assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively, supporting general account products, including term life
      insurance. For these products, the liability cash flows may have actuarial
      uncertainty. However, their amounts and timing do not vary significantly with
      interest rates. We limit interest rate risk by analyzing the expected cash
      flows
      of the products and structuring investment portfolios with similar cash flows.


Interest
      Rate Risk—Falling Rates.

The
      spreads on our fixed annuity and interest-sensitive whole life, universal life
      and fixed portion of variable universal life insurance policies, are at risk
      if
      interest rates decline and remain low for a period of time, which has generally
      been the case in recent years. For instance, the five-year Treasury yield stood
      at 6.3% at the end of 1999, it declined through 2002 to 2.7% at the end of
      and then rose modestly to 4.4 % at the end of 2005. Should interest rates remain
      at current levels that are significantly lower than those existing prior to
      the
      declines of recent years, the average earned rate of return on our annuity
      and
      universal life insurance investment portfolios will continue to decline.
      Relative to the book yield at December 31, 2004, the book yield at December
      31,
      2005 on annuity investment portfolios remained at 6.1%, while the book yield
      on
      universal life insurance portfolios declined from 6.4% to 6.3 %. Declining
      portfolio yields may cause the spreads between investment portfolio yields
      and
      the interest rate credited to policyholders to deteriorate, as our ability
      to
      manage spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and
      universal life insurance policies. Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and
      universal life insurance policies generally range from 1.5% to 5.0%, with an
      average guaranteed rate of approximately 4%. The following table provides detail
      on the percentage differences between the current interest rates being credited
      to policyholders and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate, broken
      out
      by policyholder account values reported within the Lincoln Retirement and Life
      segments at December 31, 2005.

                bands
                are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in
                which
                they will fall upon their first anniversary.

See
      Item
      2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations - Results of Operations by Segment for the effects of interest rate
      environments on interest rate margins.

The
      maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured
      to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during
      periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating
      the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and
      liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to
      manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by
      limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.

We
      believe that the portfolios supporting our accumulation and investment oriented
      insurance products have a prudent degree of call protection individually and
      on
      a consolidated basis. For instance, as of December 31, 2005, the
      mortgage-


backed
      securities (“MBS”) and asset-backed securities (“ABS”) portion represented a
      total of $6.3 billion, or 19% of the $33.7 billion of general account assets
      supporting such products. Of this portfolio, 11% of general account assets,
      or
      $3.7 billion, is subject to residential prepayment risk from investments made
      in
      Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (“CMOs”), mortgage pass-throughs,
      manufactured housing and home equity loans. As of December 31, 2004, the MBS
      and
      ABS portion of the portfolio represented a total of $6.4 billion or 19% of
      the
      $34.5 billion of general account assets supporting such products. Our MBS
      portfolio has equal to or slightly less prepayment risk than the MBS
      pass-through market in general, primarily due to holding more seasoned
      securities in the portfolio.

Interest
      Rate Risk—Rising Rates.

For
      both
      annuities and universal life insurance, a rapid and sustained rise in interest
      rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders. The portfolios
      supporting these products have fixed-rate assets laddered over maturities
      generally ranging from one to ten years or more. Accordingly, the earned rate
      on
      each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. As rates rise, the lag
      may
      be increased by slowing MBS prepayments. The greater and faster the rise in
      interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates.
      If we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between
      our renewal crediting rates and competitors’ new money rates may be wide enough
      to cause increased surrenders. If we credit more competitive renewal rates
      to
      limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow. We devote extensive effort to
      evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide
      range of interest rate scenarios. Such analysis has led to adjustments in the
      target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying
      out-of-the-money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions (see discussion
      below). With these instruments in place, the potential adverse impact of a
      rapid
      and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances.

Debt.

As of
      December 31, 2005, we had short-term debt, long-term debt and junior
      subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts totaling $1.5 billion ($1.1
      billion with fixed rates and $0.4 billion with floating rates) on the balance
      sheet. As of December 31, 2004, we had short-term debt, long-term debt and
      junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts totaling $1.6 billion
      ($1.4 billion with fixed rates and $0.2 billion with floating rates) on the
      balance sheet. We manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed-rate
      and floating-rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of
      interest rate risk for the entire enterprise.

Derivatives.

As
      indicated in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have entered
      into derivative transactions to reduce our exposure to rapid rises in interest
      rates. The programs discussed below are used to help us achieve more stable
      margins while providing competitive crediting rates to policyholders during
      periods when interest rates are rising. Failure to maintain competitive
      crediting rates could cause policyholders to withdraw their funds and place
      them
      in more competitive products.

We
      use
      interest rate cap agreements to hedge against the negative impact of a
      significant and sustained rise in interest rates. Interest rate caps are
      contracts that require counterparties to pay us at specified future dates the
      amount, if any, by which a specified market interest rate exceeds the cap rate
      stated in the agreements, applied to a notional amount. As of December 31,
      and 2004, we had agreements with notional amounts of $5.5 billion and $4.0
      billion, respectively. At December 31, 2005, the agreements had cap rates
      ranging from 150 to 500 basis points above prevailing interest rates. The cap
      rates in some contracts reset annually. These agreements expire in 2006 through
      2010.

For
      future periods, the fair value of our interest rate caps depend on the levels
      of
      future U.S. Treasury and U.S. dollar swap interest rates. The table below shows
      estimates of fair value levels for the cap portfolio at December 31, 2005 for
      future time periods and selected potential future interest rate levels.


We
      use
      interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to floating rate bond coupon
      payments, replicating a fixed rate bond. An interest rate swap is a contractual
      agreement to exchange payments at one or more times based on the actual or
      expected level of one or more underlying interest rates. We are required to
      pay
      the counterparty the stream of variable interest payments based on the coupon
      payments from the hedged bonds, and in turn, receive a fixed payment from the
      counterparty, at a predetermined interest rate. In addition, we use interest
      rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related
      to the forecasted purchase of assets to support newly acquired blocks of
      business or certain other portfolios of assets. Finally, we use interest rate
      swap agreements to hedge the risk of paying a higher fixed rate interest on
      junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts holding solely junior
      subordinated debentures and on senior debt than can be paid on long-term debt
      based on current interest rates in the marketplace. As of December 31, 2005
      and
      2004, we had swap agreements with a notional amount of $735 million and $718
      million, respectively. The agreements expire in 2006 through 2050.

We
      use
      interest rate futures to hedge our liability exposure on certain options related
      to GMWB features in variable annuity products. These futures contracts require
      payment between us and our counterparty on a daily basis for changes in the
      futures index price. As of December 31, 2005, we had interest rate futures
      with
      a notional amount of $1.6 billion. The contracts expire in 2006.

We
      used a
      treasury lock agreement to hedge our exposure to variability in future
      semi-annual interest payments, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest
      rate, related to the issuance of our 5-year, $250 million senior debt in 2002
      and 10 year, $200 million senior debt in 2004. In 2005, we entered into a
      treasury lock to hedge the anticipated issuance of debt to finance the merger
      with Jefferson-Pilot. A treasury lock is an agreement that allows the holder
      to
      lock in a benchmark interest rate, so that if the benchmark interest rate
      increases, the holder is entitled to receive a payment from the counterparty
      equal to the present value of the difference in the benchmark interest rate
      at
      the determination date and the locked-in benchmark interest rate. If the
      benchmark interest rate decreases, the holder must pay the counterparty an
      amount equal to the present value of the difference in the benchmark interest
      rate at the determination date and the locked-in benchmark interest rate. As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had open treasury locks with notional amounts of $200
      million. The contracts expire in 2006.

In
      addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative products in
      other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the
      management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies,
      guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools
      to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our
      operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy.

Foreign
            Currency Risk

Foreign
            Currency Denominated Investments.

We
            invest
            in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification
            relative to United States Dollar-Denominated (“USD”) securities. The fair value
            of foreign securities totaled $1 billion as of December 31, 2005. We
            use foreign
            currency swaps to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to
            our
            investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The currency
            risk is
            hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the
            bonds. The
            table below shows our exposure to foreign currency securities. Also included
            is
            the relevant information relating to the foreign currency derivatives
            that are
            hedging the currency risk of these securities. The table below presents
            the
            principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents by expected maturity
            for
            our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps
            as of
            December 31, 2005.

The
          table
          below presents the principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents
          of
          our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps
          as of
          December 31, 2004.


Foreign
      Currency Forward Contracts.

During
      2005, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge dividends
      received from Lincoln UK. At December 31, 2005, no foreign currency forward
      contracts were outstanding.

Foreign
      Currency Swaps.

A
      foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to exchange the currencies
      of
      two different countries at a specified rate of exchange in the future. We use
      foreign currency swaps to convert the cash flow of foreign currency securities
      to U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had foreign currency
      swap
      agreements with notional amounts of $57.7 million and $41.8 million,
      respectively. The agreements expire in 2006 through 2015.

Equity
      Market Exposures

Our
      revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market
      risk.
      See “Equity Market Guidance” in Item 7 - Management Discussion and Analysis of
      Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of
      equity market risk.

Fee
      Revenues.

The
      fee
      revenues of our Investment Management segment and fees earned from variable
      annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a
      decline in equity market values. These fees are generally a fixed percentage
      of
      the market value of assets under management. In a severe equity market decline,
      fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also
      by
      customer withdrawals and redemptions. Such withdrawals and redemptions from
      equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our
      fixed-income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors’
customers.

Assets.

While we
      invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than
      would be available in our core fixed-income investments, the returns on, and
      values of, these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market
      risk
      than our fixed-income investments. These investments, however, add
      diversification benefits to our fixed-income investments. The table below shows
      the sensitivity of price changes to our equity assets owned.

(1)

Assumes
                a +/- 10% change in underlying indexes. Fair value above does not
                reflect
                daily settlement of futures or monthly settlement of total return
                swaps.

Liabilities

.
      We have
      exposure to changes in our stock price through stock appreciation rights
      (“SARs”) issued in 2000 through 2005. The aggregate value for vested and
      non-vested SARs was $8.5 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2005,
      respectively. The aggregate value for vested and non-vested SARs was $9.5
      million and $4.9 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. This program is
      being hedged with equity derivatives as discussed below.


Derivatives
      Hedging Equity Risks.

We use
      OTC equity call options on our stock to hedge against the increase in our
      liabilities arising from SARs granted on our stock in 2000 through 2005. These
      call options require the counterparty to pay us at specified future expiration
      dates the amount, if any, of the increase in our stock price over the strike
      price of the option, applied to the number of contracts. We had 1.3 million
      call
      options on an equal number of shares of our stock at both December 31, 2005
      and
      2004. The call option expirations are matched to the liabilities and expire
      in
      2006 through 2010.

We
      use
      total return swaps to hedge a portion of the liability related to our deferred
      compensation plans. We receive the total return on a portfolio of indexes and
      pay a floating rate of interest. As of December 31, 2005, we had total return
      swaps with a notional amount of $100.9 million. These total return swaps do
      not
      have a stated contract expiration date.

We
      use
      put options to hedge a portion of the liability related to our variable annuity
      products with a GMWB feature. Put options are contracts that require
      counterparties to pay us at a specified future date the amount, if any, by
      which
      a specified equity index is less than the strike rate stated in the agreement,
      applied to a notional amount. As of December 31, 2005, we had puts with a
      notional amount of $1.4 billion, which expire in 2009 through 2020.

We
      use
      equity futures to hedge a portion of the liability related to our variable
      annuity products with a GMWB and GMDB feature. These futures contracts require
      payment between us and our counterparty on a daily basis for changes in the
      futures index price. As of December 31, 2005, we had equity futures with a
      notional amount of $252.4 million, which expire in 2006.

Default
      Risk.

Our
      portfolio of invested assets was $43.2 billion as of December 31, 2005. Of
      this
      total, $28.4 billion consists of corporate bonds and $3.7 billion consists
      of
      commercial mortgages. We manage the risk of adverse default experience on these
      investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting
      standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower-quality, higher-yielding
      investments, and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and property
      type. For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, our
      exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal
      limits set by rating quality and industry group. We remain exposed to occasional
      adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be
      significantly higher than the long-term historical average used in pricing.

We
      are
      depending on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors
      to
      honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives
      agreements. In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our
      exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in
      accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor. We generally
      limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative
      contracts to those with an A credit rating or above.

Credit-Related
      Derivatives

.
      We use
      various credit-related derivatives to minimize exposure to various
      credit-related risks. We use credit default swaps to hedge against a drop in
      bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit swap allows
      us to put the bond back to the counterparty at par upon a credit event by the
      bond issuer. A credit event is defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or
      obligation acceleration. As of December 31, 2004, we had credit swaps with
      notional amounts of $8 million. At December 31, 2005, we had no purchased credit
      default swaps outstanding.

We
      also
      sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors. The credit
      default swaps hedge the investor against a drop in bond prices due to credit
      concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit swap allows the investor to put
      the
      bond back to us at par upon a credit event by the bond issuer. A credit event
      is
      defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or restructuring. As of December 31,
      2005, we had credit default swaps with a notional amount of $20 million, which
      expire in 2010.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Selected
      Quarterly Financial Data


MANAGEMENT
      REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management
      is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
      financial reporting for LNC to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
      reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial
      statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those
      policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
      in
      reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
      dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
      are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts
      and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
      management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
      prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
      of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of internal
      control over financial reporting effectiveness to future periods are subject
      to
      risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
      conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
      procedures.

Management
      assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
      the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria
      established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
      of
      Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment
      included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness
      of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies,
      and our overall control environment.

Based
      on
      the assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over
      financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide
      reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
      preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management’s
      assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
      as of December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
      independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
      is included immediately below.


Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
        Board
        of Directors and Shareholders of

Lincoln
        National Corporation

We
        have
        audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report
        on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting, that Lincoln National Corporation
        maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
        31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
        issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (the COSO criteria). Lincoln National Corporation’s management is responsible
        for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
        its
        assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
        Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
        opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
        reporting based on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
        company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
        provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        to
        permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
        assets that could have a material effect on the financial
        statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
        our
        opinion, management’s assessment that Lincoln National Corporation maintained
        effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
        is
        fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also,
        in
        our opinion, Lincoln National Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
        effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
        based on the COSO criteria.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the 2005 consolidated financial statements
        of
        Lincoln National Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2006 expressed
        an
        unqualified opinion thereon.

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
        Board
        of Directors and Shareholders of

Lincoln
        National Corporation

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lincoln National
        Corporation (“Corporation”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
        consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
        each
        of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audit also
        included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at 15(a)(2).
        These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the
        Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
        these
        financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
        reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
        our
        opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
        material respects, the consolidated financial position of Lincoln National
        Corporation at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of
        its
        operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
        December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
        principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
        when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
        whole,
        present fairly in all material respects the information set forth
        therein.

As
        discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2004
        the
        Corporation changed its method of accounting for certain non-traditional
        long-duration contracts and for separate accounts. Also, as discussed in
        Note 2
        to the consolidated financial statements, in 2003 the Corporation changed
        its
        method of accounting for certain reinsurance arrangements.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Lincoln National
        Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
        2005,
        based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
        by
        the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
        our
        report dated February 24, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
        thereon.

      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
      of Presentation.

The
      accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include Lincoln National
      Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (“LNC” or the “Company” which
      also may be referred to as “we” or “us”). Through subsidiary companies, we
      operate multiple insurance and investment management businesses divided into
      four business segments (see Note 11). The collective group of companies uses
      “Lincoln Financial Group” as its marketing identity. Less than majority-owned
      entities in which we have at least a 20% interest are reported on the equity
      basis. These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity
      with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The
      balance sheet information presented in these financial statements and notes
      thereto is as of December 31 for each respective year. The statement of income
      information is for the year ended December 31 for each respective
      year.

Use
      of Estimates.

The
      nature of the insurance and investment management businesses requires management
      to make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
      in
      the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
      may
      differ from those estimates.

Investments.

Securities
      available-for-sale consist of fixed maturity and equity securities, which are
      carried at fair value. The cost of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities
      is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts. The cost of
      available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities is reduced to fair
      value
      with a corresponding charge to realized loss on investments for declines in
      value that are other than temporary.

Trading
      securities consist of fixed maturity and equity securities in designated
      portfolios, which support modified coinsurance (“Modco”) and coinsurance with
      funds withheld (“CFW”) reinsurance arrangements. Investment results for these
      portfolios, including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the
      reinsurers through the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements.
      Trading securities are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are
      recorded in net income as they occur. Offsetting these amounts are corresponding
      changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities associated with
      the
      underlying reinsurance arrangements.

For
      the
      mortgage-backed securities portion of the trading and available-for-sale fixed
      maturity securities portfolios, we recognize investment income using a constant
      effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic
      life
      of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield
      is
      recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments.
      When the effective yield changes, the carrying value of the security is adjusted
      prospectively. This adjustment is reflected in net investment income.

Mortgage
      loans on real estate, which are primarily held in the Life Insurance and Lincoln
      Retirement segments, are carried at the outstanding principal balances adjusted
      for amortization of premiums and discounts and are net of valuation allowances.
      Valuation allowances are established for the excess carrying value of the
      mortgage loan over its estimated fair value when it is probable that, based
      upon
      current information and events, we will be unable to collect all amounts due
      under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When we determine that a
      loan
      is impaired, the cost is adjusted or a provision for loss is established equal
      to the difference between the amortized cost of the mortgage loan and the
      estimated value. Estimated value is based on: 1) the present value of expected
      future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate; 2) the
      loan’s observable market price; or 3) the fair value of the collateral. Mortgage
      loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for losses
      and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for losses.
      The
      net provision for losses is reported as realized gain (loss) on investments.
      Interest income on mortgage loans includes interest collected, the change in
      accrued interest, and amortization of premiums and discounts. Mortgage loan
      fees
      and costs are recorded in net investment income as they are incurred.

Investment
      real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
      is
      provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
      Cost is adjusted for impairment when the projected undiscounted cash flow from
      the investment is less than the carrying value. Impaired real estate is written
      down to the estimated fair value of the real estate, which is generally computed
      using the present value of expected future cash flows from the real estate
      discounted at a rate commensurate with the underlying risks. Also, valuation
      allowances for losses are established, as appropriate, for real estate holdings
      that are in the process of being sold. Real estate acquired through foreclosure
      proceedings is reclassified on the balance sheet from mortgage loans on real
      estate to real estate and is recorded at fair value at the settlement date,
      which establishes a new cost basis. If a subsequent periodic review of a
      foreclosed property indicates the fair value, less estimated costs to sell,
      is
      lower than the carrying value at settlement date, the carrying value is adjusted
      to the lower amount. Write-downs to real estate and any changes to the reserves
      on real estate are reported as realized gain (loss) on investments.


Policy
      loans are carried at aggregate unpaid balances.

Cash
      and
      invested cash are carried at cost and include all highly liquid debt instruments
      purchased with a maturity of three months or less.

Realized
      gain (loss) on investments includes realized gains and (losses) from the sale
      of
      investments, derivative gains (losses), gains on sale of subsidiaries/business,
      and net gain on reinsurance embedded derivative/trading securities. See Note
      for additional detail. Realized gain (loss) on investments is recognized in
      net
      income, net of associated amortization of deferred acquisition costs and
      investment expenses, using the specific identification method. Changes in the
      fair values of available-for-sale securities carried at fair value are reported
      as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, after deductions
      for
      related adjustments for deferred acquisition costs and amounts required to
      satisfy policyholder commitments that would have been recorded had these
      securities been sold at their fair value, and after deferred taxes or credits
      to
      the extent deemed recoverable.

Derivative
      Instruments.

We hedge
      certain portions of our exposure to interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign
      exchange risk and equity fluctuation risk by entering into derivative
      transactions. A description of our accounting for the hedging of such risks
      is
      discussed in the following paragraphs.

We
      recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the
      Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the
      fair
      value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated
      and
      qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging
      relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify
      as hedging instruments, we must designate the hedging instrument based upon
      the
      exposure being hedged—as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge or a hedge of a net
      investment in a foreign operation. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had
      derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges
      and fair value hedges. In addition, we had derivative instruments that were
      economic hedges, but were not designated as hedging instruments under Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”).

For
      derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge,
      the
      effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported
      as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and reclassified into net
      income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
      net income. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess
      of
      the cumulative change in the present value of designated future cash flows
      of
      the hedged item (hedge ineffectiveness), if any, is recognized in net income
      during the period of change. For derivative instruments that are designated
      and
      qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument
      as
      well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the
      hedged risk are recognized in net income during the period of change in fair
      values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge
      of
      a net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss is reported in OCI
      as
      part of the cumulative translation adjustment to the extent it is effective.
      For
      derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments but are economic
      hedges, the gain or loss is recognized in current income during the period
      of
      change in the corresponding income statement line as the transaction being
      hedged.

We
      have
      certain Modco and CFW reinsurance arrangements with embedded derivatives related
      to the funds withheld assets. These derivatives are considered total return
      swaps with contractual returns that are attributable to various assets and
      liabilities associated with these reinsurance arrangements. Changes in the
      fair
      value of these derivatives are recorded in net income as they occur. Offsetting
      these amounts are corresponding changes in the fair value of trading securities
      in portfolios that support these arrangements.

See
      Note
      9 for further discussion of our accounting policy for derivative instruments.

Loaned
      Securities.

Securities loaned are treated as collateralized financing transactions and
      a
      liability is recorded equal to the cash collateral received which is typically
      greater than the market value of the related securities loaned. This liability
      is included within other liabilities within our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
      Our
      agreements with third parties generally contain contractual provisions to allow
      for additional collateral to be obtained when necessary. We value collateral
      daily and obtain additional collateral when deemed appropriate.

Property
      and Equipment.

Property
      and equipment owned for company use is included in other assets in our
      Consolidated Balance Sheet and is carried at cost less allowances for
      depreciation. Provisions for depreciation of investment real estate and property
      and equipment owned for company use are computed principally on the
      straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.


Premiums
      and Fees on Investment Products and Universal Life and Traditional Life
      Insurance Products.

Investment
      Products and Universal Life Insurance Products:

Investment products consist primarily of individual and group variable and
      fixed
      deferred annuities. Universal life insurance products include universal life
      insurance, variable universal life insurance, and other interest-sensitive
      life
      insurance policies. These products include life insurance sold to individuals,
      corporate-owned life insurance and bank-owned life insurance. Revenues for
      investment products and universal life insurance products consist of net
      investment income, asset based fees, cost of insurance charges, percent of
      premium charges, policy administration charges and surrender charges that have
      been assessed and earned against policy account balances and premiums received
      during the period. The timing of revenue recognition as it relates to fees
      assessed on investment contracts is determined based on the nature of such
      fees.
      Asset based fees, cost of insurance and policy administration charges are
      assessed on a daily or monthly basis and recognized as revenue when assessed
      and
      earned. Percent of premium charges are assessed at the time of premium payment
      and recognized as revenue when assessed and earned. Certain amounts assessed
      that represent compensation for services to be provided in future periods are
      reported as unearned revenue and recognized in income over the periods
      benefited. Surrender charges are recognized upon surrender of a contract by
      the
      contractholder in accordance with contractual terms.

Traditional
      Life Insurance Products:

Traditional life insurance products include those products with fixed and
      guaranteed premiums and benefits and consist primarily of whole life insurance,
      limited-payment life insurance, term life insurance and certain annuities with
      life contingencies. Premiums for traditional life insurance products are
      recognized as revenue when due from the policyholder.

Investment
      Advisory Fees.

As
      specified in the investment advisory agreements with the mutual funds, fees
      are
      generally determined and recognized as revenues monthly, based on the average
      daily net assets of the mutual funds managed. Investment advisory contracts
      with
      non-mutual fund clients generally provide for the determination and payment
      of
      advisory fees based on market values of managed portfolios at the end of a
      calendar month or quarter, or the average of the market values at the beginning
      and end of the monthly or quarterly period. Investment management and advisory
      contracts typically are renewable annually by the fund’s board. Contracts with
      non-mutual fund clients normally continue until terminated by either party
      or at
      the end of a specified term and often have cancellation clauses ranging up
      to 30
      to 180 days. Investment advisory fees include amounts that are ultimately paid
      to sub-advisors for managing the sub-advised assets. The amounts paid to
      sub-advisors are included in benefits and expenses.

Other
      Revenues and Fees.

Other
      revenue and fees primarily consist of amounts earned by our retail distribution
      arm, Lincoln Financial Advisors (“LFA”), from sales of third party insurance and
      investment products. Such revenue is recorded as earned at the time of sale.
      Other revenues and fees also includes revenues from our Life Insurance,
      Investment Management and Lincoln UK segments not captured in other components
      of revenue.

Assets
      Held in Separate Accounts/Liabilities Related to Separate
      Accounts.

Assets
      and liabilities related to separate accounts represent segregated funds
      administered and invested by our insurance subsidiaries for the exclusive
      benefit of pension and variable life and annuity contractholders and for
      unit-linked accounts of our U.K. subsidiaries. Both the assets and liabilities
      are carried at fair value. The fees earned by our insurance subsidiaries for
      administrative and contractholder maintenance services performed for these
      separate accounts are included in insurance fee revenue.

Deferred
      Acquisition Costs, Deferred Front End Loads, Deferred Sales
      Inducements.

Commissions and other costs of acquiring universal life insurance, variable
      universal life insurance, unit-linked products, traditional life insurance,
      annuities and other investment contracts, which vary with and are primarily
      related to the production of new business, have been deferred to the extent
      recoverable. The methodology for determining the amortization of acquisition
      costs varies by product type based on two different accounting pronouncements:
      SFAS No. 97, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
      Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of
      Investments” (“SFAS 97”) and SFAS No. 60, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
      Enterprises” (“SFAS 60”). Under SFAS 97, acquisition costs for universal life
      and variable universal life insurance and investment-type products, which
      include unit-linked products and fixed and variable deferred annuities, are
      amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the incidence of
      estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) from surrender charges, investment, mortality
      net of reinsurance ceded and expense margins, and actual realized gain (loss)
      on
      investments. Past amortization amounts are adjusted when revisions are made
      to
      the estimates of current or future gross profits expected from a group of
      products. Policy lives for universal and variable universal life policies are
      estimated to be 30 years, based on the expected lives of the policies and are
      variable based on the inception of each policy for unit-linked policies. Policy
      lives for fixed and variable deferred annuities are 14 to 20 years for the
      traditional, long surrender charge period products and 8 to 10 years for the
      more recent short-term, or no surrender charge variable products. The front-end
      load annuity product has an assumed life of 25 years. Longer lives are assigned
      to those blocks that have demonstrated favorable experience.


Under
      SFAS 60, acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products, which
      include whole life and term life insurance contracts, are amortized over periods
      of 10 to 30 years on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of
      premium of the related policies depending on the block of business. There are
      currently no deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) being amortized under SFAS 60
      for fixed and variable payout annuities.

For
      all
      SFAS 97 and SFAS 60 policies, amortization is based on assumptions consistent
      with those used in the development of the underlying policy form adjusted for
      emerging experience and expected trends.

Policy
      sales charges that are collected in the early years of an insurance policy
      have
      been deferred (referred to as “deferred front-end loads” or “DFEL”) and are
      amortized into income over the life of the policy in a manner consistent with
      that used for DAC. (See above for discussion of amortization methodologies.)

Bonus
      credits and excess interest for dollar cost averaging (“DCA”) contracts are
      considered sales inducements and are deferred as a sales inducement asset
      (referred to as “deferred sales inducements” or “DSI”) included in other assets.
      DSI is amortized as a benefit expense over the expected life of the contract.
      Amortization is computed using the same methodology and assumptions used in
      amortizing DAC.

Benefits
      and Expenses.

Benefits
      and expenses for universal life-type and other interest-sensitive life insurance
      products include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit claims
      incurred during the period in excess of policy account balances. Interest
      crediting rates associated with funds invested in the general account of LNC’s
      insurance subsidiaries during 2003 through 2005 ranged from 4.00% to 7.00%.
      For
      traditional life, group health and disability income products, benefits and
      expenses, other than DAC, are recognized when incurred in a manner consistent
      with the related premium recognition policies. Benefits and expenses includes
      the change in reserves for annuity products with guaranteed benefits, such
      as
      guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed income benefits
      (“GIB”), and the change in fair values of guarantees for annuity products with
      guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”).

Interest
      and debt expense includes interest on short-term commercial paper, long-term
      senior debt that we issue and junior subordinated debentures issued to
      affiliated trusts.

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill,
      as measured by the excess of the cost of acquired subsidiaries or businesses
      over the fair value of net assets acquired, is not amortized, but is subject
      to
      impairment tests conducted at least annually.

Other
      intangible assets for acquired insurance businesses consist of the value of
      existing blocks of business (referred to as the “present value of in-force”).
      The present value of in-force (“PVIF”) is amortized over the expected lives of
      the block of insurance business in relation to the incidence of estimated
      profits expected to be generated on universal life, variable universal life
      and
      investment-type products acquired, (i.e., unit-linked products and variable
      deferred annuities) and over the premium paying period for insurance products
      acquired, (i.e., traditional life insurance products). Amortization is based
      upon assumptions used in pricing the acquisition of the block of business and
      is
      adjusted for emerging experience. Accordingly, amortization periods and methods
      of amortization for PVIF vary depending upon the particular characteristics
      of
      the underlying blocks of acquired insurance business. PVIF is amortized in
      a
      manner consistent with DAC.

Other
      intangible assets for Investment Management subsidiaries that we acquired
      include institutional customer relationships, covenants not to compete and
      mutual fund customer relationships. These assets are required to be amortized
      on
      a straight-line basis over their useful life for periods ranging from 14 to
      years depending upon the characteristics of the particular underlying
      relationships for the intangible asset.

The
      carrying values of other intangible assets are reviewed periodically for
      indicators of impairment in value that are other than temporary, including
      unexpected or adverse changes in the following: (1) the economic or competitive
      environments in which the company operates, (2) profitability analyses, (3)
      cash
      flow analyses, and (4) the fair value of the relevant subsidiary. If there
      was
      an indication of impairment then the cash flow method would be used to measure
      the impairment and the carrying value would be adjusted as necessary.

Insurance
      and Investment Contract Liabilities.

The
      liabilities for future policy benefits and claim reserves for universal and
      variable universal life insurance policies consist of policy account balances
      that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges.
      The liabilities for future insurance policy benefits and claim reserves for
      traditional life policies are computed using assumptions for investment yields,
      mortality and withdrawals based principally on generally accepted actuarial
      methods and assumptions at the time of policy issue. Interest assumptions for
      traditional direct


individual
      life reserves for all policies range from 2.25% to 7.00% depending on the time
      of policy issue. The interest assumptions for immediate and deferred paid-up
      annuities range from 0.75% to 13.50%.

Beginning
      January 1, 2004, the liabilities for future claim reserves for variable annuity
      products containing GMDB features are calculated by multiplying the benefit
      ratio (present value of total expected GMDB payments over the life of the
      contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments over the
      life of the contract) by the cumulative assessments recorded from the contract
      inception through the balance sheet date less the cumulative GMDB payments
      plus
      interest. The change in the reserve for a period is the benefit ratio multiplied
      by the assessments recorded for the period less GMDB claims paid in the period
      plus interest. If experience or assumption changes result in a new benefit
      ratio, the reserves are unlocked to reflect the changes in a manner similar
      to
      DAC. Prior to January 1, 2004, the liabilities for future claim reserves for
      the
      GMDB feature were a function of the net amount at risk (“NAR”), mortality,
      persistency and incremental death benefit mortality and expense assessments
      (“M&E”) expected to be incurred over the period of time for which the NAR
      was positive.

With
      respect to its insurance and investment contract liabilities, we continually
      review: 1) overall reserve position; 2) reserving techniques and 3) reinsurance
      arrangements. As experience develops and new information becomes known,
      liabilities are adjusted as deemed necessary. The effects of changes in
      estimates are included in the operating results for the period in which such
      changes occur.

The
      business written or assumed by us includes participating life insurance
      contracts, under which the policyholder is entitled to share in the earnings
      of
      such contracts via receipt of dividends. The dividend scale for participating
      policies is reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect recent experience
      and future expectations. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004 participating policies
      comprised approximately 3% of the face amount of insurance in force,
      and dividend expenses were

$80.2
      million, $81.6 million and $82.5 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Reinsurance.

Our

insurance
      companies enter into reinsurance agreements with other companies in the normal
      course of their business. Assets/Liabilities and premiums/benefits from certain
      reinsurance contracts that grant statutory surplus relief to other insurance
      companies are netted on the balance sheets and income statements, respectively,
      since there is a right of offset. All other reinsurance agreements are reported
      on a gross basis in the balance sheets as an asset for amounts recoverable
      from
      reinsurers or as a component of other liabilities for amounts, such as premiums,
      owed to the reinsurers, with the exception of Modco agreements for which the
      right of offset also exists.

Pension
      and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

.
      Pursuant to the accounting rules for our obligations to employees under our
      various pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we are required to
      make
      a number of assumptions to estimate related liabilities and expenses. We use
      assumptions for the weighted-average discount rate, expected return on plan
      assets and a salary increase assumption to estimate pension expense. The
      discount rate assumptions are determined using an analysis of current market
      information and the projected benefit flows associated with these plans. The
      expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is initially established at
      the
      beginning of the plan year based on historical and projected future rates of
      return and is the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or
      to
      be invested in the plan. The calculation of our accumulated postretirement
      benefit obligation also uses an assumption of weighted-average annual rate
      of
      increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, which reflects a health
      care cost trend rate. See Note 8 for more information on our accounting for
      employee benefit plans.

Stock
      Based Compensation.

We
      expense the fair value of stock awards included in our incentive compensation
      plans. On the date our Board of Directors approves stock awards, the fair value
      of stock options is determined using a Black-Sholes options valuation
      methodology. The fair value of other stock awards is based upon the market
      value
      of the stock. The fair value of the awards is expensed over the service period,
      which generally corresponds to the vesting period, and is recognized as an
      increase to common stock in shareholders’ equity. For additional information on
      stock based incentive compensation see Note 8.

Advertising.

We
      expense the cost of producing and disseminating company advertising as incurred.

Foreign
      Currency Translation.

Our
      foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts and income statement items are
      translated at the current and average exchange rates for the year, respectively.
      Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of shareholders’
equity. Other translation adjustments for foreign currency transactions that
      affect cash flows are reported in comprehensive income.

Earnings
      per Share.

Basic
      earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common
      shareholders by the average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per
      share is computed assuming the conversion or exercise of


dilutive
      convertible preferred securities, non-vested stock, stock options, performance
      share units and deferred compensation shares outstanding during the year.

Income
      Taxes.

We
      file a
      U.S. consolidated income tax return that includes all of our eligible
      subsidiaries. Deferred income taxes are recognized when assets and liabilities
      have different values for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. A
      valuation allowance is recorded to the extent required to reduce the deferred
      tax asset to an amount that we expect, more likely than not, will be realized.
      See Note 5 for additional information.

Reclassifications.

Certain
      amounts reported in prior years’ Consolidated Financial Statements have been
      reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current year.
      These
      reclassifications have no effect on net income or shareholders’ equity of the
      prior years.

      Changes in Accounting Principles and Changes in Estimates

SFAS
      No. 123(r) - Accounting for Share-Based Payment.

In
      December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No.
      123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(r)”), which is a revision
      of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-based Compensation.” SFAS 123(r) requires
      recognition in the income statement of all share-based payments to employees
      based on their fair values. We had previously adopted the retroactive
      restatement method under SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-based Compensation
      - Transition and Disclosure,” and restated all periods presented to reflect
      stock-based employee compensation cost under the fair value accounting method
      for all employee awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years beginning
      after December 15, 1994.

We
      currently use the Black-Scholes formula to estimate the value of stock options
      granted to employees. We are evaluating the use of other acceptable option
      valuation models upon the required adoption of SFAS 123(r). SFAS 123(r) also
      requires the reporting of the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
      compensation as financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow.
      In
      April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) deferred required
      implementation to January 1, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123(r)
      to have a material effect on our results of operations, operating cash flows
      or
      financial position.

Statement
      of Position 05-1

.
      In
      September 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
      Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) issued Statement of Position
      (“SOP”) 05-1, “Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
      Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts”
(“SOP 05-1”). SOP 05-1 addresses the accounting for DAC on internal replacements
      other than those described in SFAS 97. An internal replacement is defined by
      SOP
      05-1 as a modification in product benefits, features, rights or coverages that
      occurs by (a) exchanging the contract for a new contract, (b) amending,
      endorsing or attaching a rider to the contract, or (c) electing a feature or
      coverage within a replaced contract. Contract modifications that result in
      a
      substantially unchanged contract will be accounted for as a continuation of
      the
      replaced contract. Contract modifications that result in a substantially changed
      contract should be accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contract,
      and any unamortized DAC, unearned revenue and deferred sales charges must be
      written-off. SOP 05-1 is to be applied prospectively and is effective for
      internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
      2006. We expect to adopt SOP 05-1 effective January 1, 2007. We are currently
      evaluating the potential effects of SOP 05-1 on our consolidated financial
      condition and results of operations.

EITF
      03-1 - The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to
      Certain Investments.

In March
      2004, the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a final consensus
      on Issue 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
      Application to Certain Investments” (“EITF 03-1”). EITF 03-1 established
      impairment models for determining whether to record impairment losses associated
      with investments in certain equity and debt securities. It also required the
      accrual of income on a level-yield basis following an impairment of debt
      securities, where reasonable estimates of the timing and amount of future cash
      flows can be made.

In
      September 2004, the FASB delayed the effective date of the accounting and
      measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 in order to consider further guidance.
      However, the disclosure requirements and the definition of other-than-temporary
      impairment (“OTTI”) included in EITF 03-1 were not delayed, and accordingly we
      adopted the definition of OTTI to evaluate all securities within the scope
      of
      EITF 03-1 and provided the required disclosures.

In
      November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 115-1 and FAS
      124-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to
      Certain Investments” (“FSP 115-1”). The guidance in FSP 115-1 nullifies the
      accounting and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1, references existing OTTI
      guidance, and supersedes EITF Topic No. D-44 “Recognition of
      Other-Than-Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a Security Whose Cost


Exceeds
      Fair Value.” FSP 115-1 will be applied prospectively and is effective for
      reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt FSP 115-1
      on
      January 1, 2006. Our existing policies for recognizing OTTIs are consistent
      with
      the guidance in FSP 115-1, therefore we do not expect the adoption will have
      an
      effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of
      operations.

SFAS
      No. 155 - Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments - an amendment
      of
      FASB Statements No. 133 and 140

.
      In
      February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
      Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140” (“SFAS
      155”), which permits fair value remeasurement for a hybrid financial instrument
      that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation.
      Under SFAS 155, an entity may make an irrevocable election to measure a hybrid
      financial instrument at fair value, in its entirety, with changes in fair value
      recognized in earnings. SFAS 155 also: (a) clarifies which interest-only strips
      and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133;
      (b)
      eliminates the interim guidance in SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. D1,
“Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial
      Assts,” and establishes a requirement to evaluate beneficial interests in
      securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding
      derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded
      derivative requiring bifurcation; (c) clarifies that concentrations of credit
      risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and, (d)
      eliminates restrictions on a qualifying special-purpose entity’s ability to hold
      passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests
      that are or contain a derivative financial instrument. We expect to adopt SFAS
      155 for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a
      remeasurement event occurring after January 1, 2007. Upon adoption of SFAS
      155,
      the fair value election may also be applied to hybrid financial instruments
      that
      had previously been bifurcated pursuant to SFAS 133. Prior period restatement
      is
      not permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effects of SFAS 155
      on
      our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Statement
      of Position 03-1.

Effective January 1, 2004, we implemented the provisions of AICPA SOP 03-1,
      “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional
      Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (“SOP 03-1”). Adjustments
      arising from implementation, as discussed below, were recorded in net income
      as
      a cumulative effect of accounting change.

Guaranteed
      Minimum Death Benefit Reserves.

Although
      there was no method prescribed under GAAP for GMDB reserving until the issuance
      of SOP 03-1, our Lincoln Retirement segment had been recording a reserve for
      GMDBs. At December 31, 2003, our GMDB reserve was $46.4 million. Adoption of
      the
      GMDB reserving methodology under SOP 03-1 resulted in a decrease to reserves
      of
      $9.7 million pre-tax. GMDB reserves were $14.8 million and $18.2 million at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Application
      of SOP 03-1 impacts EGPs used to calculate amortization of DAC, PVIF, DSI,
      and
      the liability for DFEL. The benefit ratio approach under SOP 03-1 results in
      a
      portion of future GMDB fees being accrued as a liability for future GMDB
      reserves. As a result, the EGPs used in our determination of DAC amortization
      are lower under SOP 03-1. Therefore upon adoption of SOP 03-1 we reported an
      unfavorable DAC/PVIF/DSI/DFEL unlocking as a negative cumulative effect
      adjustment of $43.2 million pre-tax in 2004.

The
      combined effects of the GMDB reserve requirements and related unlocking
      adjustments from implementation of SOP 03-1 resulted in a charge to net income
      for the cumulative effect of accounting change of $33.5 million pre-tax ($21.8
      million after-tax) in 2004.

Sales
      Inducements.

Our
      Lincoln Retirement segment variable annuity product offerings include contracts
      that offer a bonus credit, typically ranging from 2% to 5% of each deposit.
      We
      also offer enhanced interest rates to variable annuity contracts that are under
      DCA funding arrangements. Bonus credits and excess DCA interest are considered
      sales inducements under SOP 03-1 and, as such, are to be deferred as a sales
      inducement asset and amortized as a benefit expense over the expected life
      of
      the contract. Amortization is computed using the same methodology and
      assumptions used in amortizing DAC.

We
      previously deferred bonus credits as part of the DAC asset and reported the
      amortization of bonus credits as part of DAC amortization. Upon implementation
      of SOP 03-1, we reclassified bonus credits of $45.2 million from DAC to DSI,
      which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
      Amortization of the DSI asset is reported as part of benefit expense. Prior
      period balance sheet and income statement line item presentation has been
      reclassified to conform to the new basis of presentation.

We
      previously reported excess DCA interest as benefit expense when the excess
      interest was earned under the contract. As required by SOP 03-1, during the
      first quarter of 2004, we began deferring excess DCA interest as DSI and
      amortizing this DSI as benefit expense over the expected life of the contract.
      Over the long run the same amount of excess DCA interest expense will emerge
      under SOP 03-1 as under our previous accounting method. However, due to the
      prospective treatment of


new
      DSI,
      our net income was $7.9 million higher under SOP 03-1 in 2004 relative to the
      approach used in 2003. This pattern is expected to continue for near term
      financial reporting periods.

Universal
      Life Contracts.

Our Life
      Insurance segment offers an array of individual and survivor-life universal
      life
      insurance products that contain features for which SOP 03-1 might apply. A
      review of the products and their features for possible SOP implications
      concluded that no additional reserves were necessary with the exception of
      the
      MoneyGuard

®

product.

MoneyGuard

®

is
      a
      universal life insurance product with an acceleration of death benefit feature
      that provides convalescent care benefit payments when the insured becomes
      chronically ill. There is an optional extension of benefit rider available
      that
      will provide continuation of the convalescent care benefit payments once the
      total benefits from the base policy have been exhausted. The optional extended
      benefit payments can be for 2 years, 4 years, or the remaining life of the
      insured. Charges for the extension rider are deducted from the base policy
      account value and vary by the length of extension period selected. The adoption
      of SOP 03-1 in 2004 resulted in a charge recorded as a cumulative effect of
      accounting change of $4.2 million pre-tax ($2.7 million after-tax) for the
      extension of benefit feature in

FSP
      FAS 97-1 - Situations in Which Paragraphs of FASB Statement No. 97 Permit or
      Require Accrual of an Unearned Revenue Liability.

In June
      2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 97-1 (“FSP 97-1”), which was effective for the
      third quarter of 2004. FSP 97-1 clarified that SOP 03-1 did not restrict the
      recording of a liability for unearned revenue as defined in accordance with
      paragraphs 17(b) and 20 of SFAS 97 to only those situations where profits are
      followed by expected losses. We implemented the requirements of FSP 97-1, and
      they did not have any effect on our results of operations.

FSP
      FAS 106-2 - Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
      Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of
      2003.

In May
      2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2 (“FSP 106-2”), to provide accounting
      guidance related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization
      Act of 2003 (“the Medicare Act”), which became law in December 2003. The
      Medicare Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, and a
      federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide
      a
      benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. FSP 106-2
      requires sponsors of a post-retirement health care plan that provides retiree
      prescription drug benefits to reflect the provisions of the Medicare Act in
      determining post-retirement benefit cost for the first annual or interim period
      starting after June 15, 2004. We completed our analysis and incorporated the
      provisions of the Medicare Act in determining other post-retirement benefit
      costs and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation in the third
      quarter of 2004. Implementation of FSP 106-2 did not have a material effect
      on
      our results of operations. For additional information, see Note 8. During 2005,
      we became eligible to receive the federal subsidy available under the Medicare
      Act, as the retiree prescription drug benefits included in our retiree medical
      benefit plan are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.

Accounting
      for Modified Coinsurance.

During
      the fourth quarter of 2003, we implemented the FASB’s Derivative Implementation
      Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B36 (“DIG B36”). DIG B36 provides
      that the embedded derivatives included within Modco and CFW reinsurance
      agreements must be accounted for separately from the underlying reinsurance
      agreements. Our effective date for implementation of DIG B36 was the October
      1,
      2003 start date of the fourth quarter. At the time of adoption, we recorded
      a
      charge to net income as a cumulative effect of accounting change of $255.2
      million after-tax ($392.5 million pre-tax), representing the fair value of
      the
      embedded derivatives included in various Modco and CFW reinsurance agreements.
      In conjunction with the cumulative effect of accounting change, we also recorded
      an increase in other comprehensive income of $244.6 million after-tax ($376.3
      million pre-tax), relating to a release of the liability for unrealized
      investment gains on the underlying available-for-sale securities, which, prior
      to the implementation of DIG B36, had been accounted for as gains benefiting
      the
      reinsurance companies assuming the risks under the Modco and CFW reinsurance
      agreements. Concurrent with the initial recording of the embedded derivative
      associated with these reinsurance arrangements, LNC reclassified related
      available-for-sale securities to trading securities, resulting in a
      mark-to-market adjustment of $371.5 million pre-tax ($241.5 million after-tax).
      The net effect of these adjustments, at the time of implementing DIG B36, was
      a
      reduction of $13.7 million in net income and $10.6 million in shareholders’
equity.

      Recent Developments

On
      October 9, 2005, we entered into a merger agreement with Jefferson-Pilot
      Corporation ("Jefferson-Pilot"), as amended on January 26, 2006, pursuant to
      which Jefferson-Pilot will merge into one of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
      Jefferson-Pilot, through its subsidiaries, offers full lines of individual
      life,
      annuity and investment products, and group life insurance products, disability
      income and dental policies, and it operates television and radio stations.

Under
      the
      terms of the merger agreement, as amended, Jefferson-Pilot shareholders may
      choose to receive (i) 1.0906 shares of LNC common stock for each of their
      shares, (ii) $55.96 in cash for each of their shares or (iii) a combination
      of
      LNC common stock and cash. Notwithstanding the election, the aggregate amount
      of
      the cash payment to Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will equal $1.8 billion.
      Accordingly, the election of Jefferson-Pilot shareholders may be subject to
      a
      pro-rata adjustment. LNC plans to utilize the existing bridge facility (see
      below) to finance the cash portion of the purchase price at closing and to
      permanently finance the cash portion of the purchase price as soon as
      practicable after closing through a combination of senior and subordinated
      long-term debt or other securities. The transaction, which is subject to the
      approval of shareholders of both companies, regulatory approvals and customary
      closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter of
      2006.

In
      October 2005, a purported shareholder class action suit for damages was filed
      in
      state court in North Carolina naming Jefferson-Pilot, most of the individual
      members of its board of directors and LNC as defendants. The complaint alleged
      that certain defendants had breached their fiduciary duties by entering into
      the
      merger agreement. The complaint sought, among other things, unspecified
      compensatory damages. In January 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion to
      voluntarily withdraw the lawsuit, which the court granted without prejudice,
      subject to the restriction that the plaintiffs receive the court’s permission
      before filing any other actions asserting the same claims in North Carolina
      or
      any other jurisdiction. The voluntary dismissal of this action did not involve
      a
      settlement or any compensation being paid or promised to
      plaintiffs.

In
      December 2005, we entered into a bridge facility with a group of banks to
      provide for borrowings of up to $2.3 billion in connection with our merger
      with
      Jefferson-Pilot and planned share repurchase, and in February 2006, we entered
      into a Credit and Letter of Credit Facility with a group of banks to provide
      for

Provisions
      (credits) for write-downs and net changes in allowances for loss, which are
      included in the realized gain (loss) on investments and derivative instruments
      shown above, are as follows:

The portion of market adjustment for trading securities
        still
        held at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was a gain (loss) of $(78.8) million,
        $24.4 million and $334.7 million, respectively.

The
          change in net unrealized gains (losses) on investments in fixed maturity
          and
          equity securities available-for-sale is as follows:

For
          total
          publicly traded and private securities we held at December 31, 2005 and
          that are in unrealized loss status, the fair value, amortized cost, unrealized
          loss and total time period that the security has been in an unrealized
          loss
          position are presented in the table below.


For
      fixed
      maturity and equity securities available-for-sale with unrealized losses as
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, the gross unrealized losses and fair value,
      aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities
      have been in a continuous loss position are summarized as follows:

Securities
      available-for-sale deemed to have declines in fair value that were other than
      temporary were written down to fair value. The fixed maturity securities to
      which these write-downs apply were generally of investment grade at the time
      of
      purchase, but were subsequently downgraded by rating agencies to
“below-investment grade.” Factors we considered in determining whether declines
      in the fair value of fixed maturity securities are other than temporary include
      1) the significance of the decline, 2) our ability and intent to retain the
      investment for a sufficient period of time for it to recover, 3) the time period
      during which there has been a significant decline in value, and 4) fundamental
      analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial condition
      of
      the issuer. Based upon these factors, securities that have indications of
      potential impairment are subject to intensive review. Where such analysis
      results in a conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary,
      the security is written down to fair value. See Note 10 for a general discussion
      of the methodologies and assumptions used to determine estimated fair values.

The
      balance sheet captions, real estate and other assets, which includes property
      and equipment, include accumulated depreciation as follows:

Impaired
      mortgage loans along with the related allowance for losses are as follows:

The
      allowance for losses is maintained at a level we believe is adequate to absorb
      estimated probable credit losses. Our periodic evaluation of the adequacy of
      the
      allowance for losses is based on our past loan loss experience, known and
      inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the
      borrower’s ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the
      estimated value of the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio,
      current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is
      inherently subjective, as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of
      future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be
      susceptible to significant change.

A
      reconciliation of the mortgage loan allowance for losses for these impaired
      mortgage loans is as follows:

The
      average recorded investment in impaired mortgage loans and the interest income
      recognized on impaired mortgage loans were as follows:

All
      interest income on impaired mortgage loans was recognized on the cash basis
      of
      income recognition.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no mortgage loans on non-accrual status
      and
      no mortgage loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had restructured mortgage loans of $45.2 million
      and $69.5 million, respectively. We recorded $2.4 million and $3.6 million
      of
      interest income on these restructured mortgage loans in 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. Interest income in the amount of $3.8 million and $6.4 million
      would have been recorded on these mortgage loans according to their original
      terms in 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we
      had
      no outstanding commitments to lend funds on restructured mortgage loans.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, our investment commitments for fixed maturity securities
      (primarily private placements), mortgage loans on real estate and real estate
      were $802.6 million. This includes $276.2 million of standby commitments to
      purchase real estate upon completion and leasing.

The
      carrying value of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale, mortgage loans
      on real estate and real estate investments which were non-income producing
      totaled $67.0 million and $147.4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively.

During
      2003, we completed a securitization of commercial mortgage loans. In the
      aggregate, the loans had a fair value of $182.2 million and a carrying value
      of
      $167.3 million. We received $182.2 million from the trust for the sale of the
      loans. A recourse liability was not recorded since we are not obligated to
      repurchase any loans from the trust that may later become delinquent. The
      transaction was hedged with interest rate swaps to lock in the value of the
      loans. We recorded a gain on the hedge of $7.8 million pre-tax and realized
      a
      gain on the sale of $14.9 million pre-tax resulting in a total net gain of
      $22.7
      million pre-tax. We did not retain an interest in the securitized assets.


5.
      Federal Income Taxes

The
      Federal income tax expense is as follows:

The
          effective tax rate on pre-tax income is lower than the prevailing corporate
          Federal income tax rate. A reconciliation of this difference is as follows:

The
          Federal income tax asset (liability), which is included in other liabilities
          on
          the Consolidated Balance Sheet, is as follows:


Significant
      components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

Cash
      paid
      for Federal income taxes in 2005 and 2004 was $105.0 million and $154.5 million,
      respectively. Net cash received for Federal income taxes in 2003 was $65.0
      million due to the carry back of 2002 tax losses.

We
      are
      required to establish a valuation allowance for any gross deferred tax assets
      that are unlikely to reduce taxes payable in future years’ tax returns. At
      December 31, 2005, we believe that it is more likely than not that all gross
      deferred tax assets will reduce taxes payable in future years. Our Federal
      income tax liability at December 31, 2004 included a valuation allowance of
      $46.8 million attributable to the net operating losses of our foreign life
      reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in Barbados. This valuation allowance was
      reduced to zero as of December 31, 2005.

We
      have
      made the decision not to permanently reinvest earnings in Lincoln National
      (UK)
      plc. Full U.S. deferred taxes applicable to any un-repatriated earnings have
      been recorded.

Under
      prior Federal income tax law, one-half of the excess of a life insurance
      company’s income from operations over its taxable investment income was not
      taxed, but was set aside in a special tax account designated as “Policyholders’
Surplus.” On October 23, 2004, President Bush signed into law the “American Jobs
      Creation Act of 2004.” In 2005 and 2006, the additional tax imposed on
      distributions from the special tax account, “Policyholders Surplus,” is
      suspended. In addition, the statute provides that distributions made during
      the
      two-year suspension period will first reduce the Policyholders Surplus account
      balance. Our insurance subsidiaries’ dividend activity for 2005 eliminated the
      account balance during the suspension period.

The
      American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 also provided for an election for either
      or 2005 of a special one-time tax deduction of 85 percent of certain foreign
      earnings that are repatriated. Based on our evaluation of the effects of the
      repatriation provision, we determined it would not be beneficial to make the
      election for dividends received from our foreign subsidiaries during 2004 and
      2005.

We
      are
      subject to annual tax examinations from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).
      The IRS has examined tax years 1996, 1997 and 1998, with assessments resulting
      in a payment that was not material to the consolidated results of operations.
      In
      addition to taxes assessed and interest, the payment included a deposit relating
      to a portion of the assessment, which we continue to challenge. We believe
      this
      portion of the assessment is inconsistent with existing law, and are protesting
      it through the established IRS appeals process. We are currently under audit
      by
      the IRS for years 1999-2002. We do not anticipate that any adjustments that
      might result from such audits would be material to our consolidated results
      of
      operations or financial condition.

Reinsurance
      transactions included in insurance premiums and insurance fees on the
      Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding amounts attributable to the
      indemnity reinsurance transaction with Swiss Re, are as follows:

Benefits
      on the Consolidated Statements of Income is net of reinsurance recoveries
      of $0.6 billion for each of 2005, 2004 and 2003.

A

Realized
      gains and losses on investments and derivative instruments on the Statements
      of
      Income for 2005, 2004 and 2003 are net of amounts amortized against deferred
      acquisition costs of $48.5 million, $45.6 million and $50.2 million,
      respectively. In addition, realized gains and losses for 2005, 2004 and 2003
      are
      net of adjustments made to policyholder reserves of $(2.1) million, $(2.9)
      million and $48.4 million, respectively. We have either a contractual obligation
      or a consistent historical practice of making allocations of investment gains
      or
      losses to certain policyholders and to certain reinsurance
      arrangements.

A
      rollforward of deferred sales inducements, included in other assets on the
      Consolidated Balance Sheet, is as follows:


Details
      underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses on the
      Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:

Included
      in operating and administrative expenses are the expenses for company
      advertising of approximately $30.7 million, $27.4 million and $21.2 million
      in
      2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

During
      the third quarter of 2005, 2004 and 2003, we completed our annual comprehensive
      reviews of the assumptions underlying the amortization of DAC, PVIF, DSI and
      DFEL as well as the reserves related to GMDB and the embedded derivative related
      to GMWB. As a result of the comprehensive reviews, we recorded net positive
      prospective unlocking of approximately $63 million pre-tax ($41 million
      after-tax) and $15 million pre-tax ($10 million after-tax) for 2005 and 2004,
      respectively, and negative prospective unlocking of approximately $28 million
      pre-tax ($18 million after-tax) in 2003.

                on
                the prevailing exchange rate as of the respective balance sheet dates.

The
      aggregate amortization expense for other intangible assets for 2005, 2004,
      and
      2003 was $75.0 million, $130.0 million and $88.2 million, respectively.

In
      February 2006, we entered into a new credit agreement (the “2006 credit
      agreement”) with a group of banks, which expires in 2011, that allows for
      borrowing or issuance of letters of credit of up to $1.0 billion. In December
      2005, we entered into a new credit agreement (the “Bridge Facility”) with a
      group of banks to provide for borrowings of up to $2.3 billion in connection
      with our merger with Jefferson-Pilot and planned share repurchase. The Bridge
      Facility is a 364-day facility. Specifically, if we make a drawdown under the
      Bridge Facility, we may only use the proceeds of the loan to pay up to $1.8
      billion to shareholders of Jefferson-Pilot in connection with our previously
      announced merger with Jefferson-Pilot, which represents the aggregate cash
      portion of the merger consideration, and/or to repurchase up to $500 million
      of
      our common stock.

At
      December 31, 2005, we maintained two revolving credit agreements with a group
      of
      domestic and foreign banks: a $500 million five-year revolving credit facility
      maturing in December 2009 and a U.K. facility, which was renewed in January
      for 10 million pounds sterling ($17 million at December 31, 2005) maturing
      in
      November 2006. At December 31, 2005, we did not have any amounts outstanding
      under any of the bank lines. Both agreements provide for interest on borrowings
      based on various money market indices. Under the agreements, we must maintain
      senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of at least S&P A- and Moody’s A3 or
      be restricted by an adjusted debt to capitalization ratio. At December 31,
      2005,
      we had no outstanding borrowings under the agreements.

In
      May
      2005, our 7.25% senior notes of $193 million matured. On October 1, 2004, we
      redeemed all $120.3 million of our outstanding 9.125% Debentures due October
      1,
      2024 for an aggregate redemption amount of $125.5 million. Interest and debt
      expense in the fourth quarter of 2004 includes approximately $6.3 million ($4.1
      million after-tax) relating to the call premium and unamortized issue costs
      relating to the redemption.

In
      February 2004, we issued $200 million of 4.75% Notes due February 15, 2014
      with
      semi-annual interest payments in February and August. The notes were priced
      at
      99.297% and net proceeds to the company were $197.3 million. A portion of the
      net proceeds was used to redeem the 9.125% notes described above with the
      remainder of the proceeds used for general corporate purposes and to reduce
      short-term debt. We used a treasury lock to reduce exposure to interest rate
      changes prior to closing. The treasury lock was closed prior to the issuance
      of
      the Notes with a gain of approximately $1 million. This gain, along with the
      costs of issuance, is being amortized over the life of the Notes.

In
      July
      2003, we redeemed the $200 million 7.40% Trust Originated Preferred Securities
      (“TOPrS”) issued by Lincoln Capital III and guaranteed by us. A loss of $3.7
      million ($5.6 million pre-tax) related to unamortized issuance costs was
      reported in 2003 related to the redemption. This expense is included in interest
      and debt expense in the Statements of Income. In September 2003, Lincoln Capital
      VI, our wholly-owned affiliated trust, issued $150 million of 6.75% Trust
      Preferred Securities, Series F guaranteed by us. The debentures mature September
      11, 2052 and can be redeemed for principal plus accrued interest beginning
      September 11, 2008.

We
      also
      have access to capital from junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated
      trusts. These trusts were formed solely for the purpose of issuing preferred
      securities and lending the proceeds to us. Securities currently outstanding
      were
      offered through a series of trusts (Lincoln National Capital V and VI). We
      own
      the common securities of these trusts. The only assets of Lincoln National
      Capital V and VI are the junior subordinated debentures issued by us.
      Distributions are paid by these trusts to the preferred security holders on
      a
      quarterly basis. The principal obligations of these trusts are irrevocably
      guaranteed by us. Upon liquidation of these trusts, the holders of the preferred
      securities would be entitled to a fixed amount per share plus accumulated and
      unpaid distributions. We reserve the right to: 1) redeem the preferred
      securities at a fixed price plus accumulated and unpaid distributions and;
      2)
      defer the interest payments due on the subordinated debentures for up to 20
      consecutive quarters, but not beyond the maturity date of the subordinated
      debenture. We have determined that the trusts are variable interest entities
      as
      defined by

FASB
      Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“FIN
      46”).

Prior to the implementation of FIN 46, we consolidated the trusts,
      which resulted in the elimination of the junior subordinated debentures issued
      to the affiliated trusts. Upon implementation of FIN 46, we no longer
      consolidate these trusts. The effect of the deconsolidation was not material.

We
      paid
      cash of $90.4 million, $93.0 million and $93.5 million for interest related
      to
      our debt and junior subordinated debentures of affiliated subsidiary trusts
      for
      2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

At
      December 31, 2005, we had $600 million of remaining authorization to issue
      various securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock,
      warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of LNC and trust


preferred
      securities of four subsidiary trusts under an existing shelf registration.
      In
      November 2005, our Board of Directors increased our authorization, allowing
      us
      to issue up to $4 billion of securities, which includes the $600 million of
      remaining authorization, under a new shelf registration statement filed in
      March
      2006.

      Insurance Benefit Reserves

We
      issue
      variable contracts through our separate accounts for which investment income
      and
      investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne
      by,
      the contractholder (traditional variable annuities). We also issue variable
      annuity and life contracts through separate accounts that include various types
      of GMDB, GMWB and GIB. The GMDB features include those where we contractually
      guarantee to the contract holder either (

a

)
      return
      of no less than total deposits made to the contract less any partial
      withdrawals, (

b

)
      total
      deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum
      return, or (

c

)
      the
      highest contract value on a specified anniversary date minus any partial
      withdrawals following the contract anniversary.

The
      following table provides information on the GMDB features outstanding at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004. (Note that our variable contracts with guarantees
      may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract; therefore, the
      amounts listed are not mutually exclusive.) The net amount at risk is defined
      as
      the current guaranteed minimum death benefit in excess of the current account
      balance at the balance sheet date.

Approximately
      $8.2 billion and $4.2 billion of separate account values at December 31, 2005
      and 2004 were attributable to variable annuities with a GMWB feature. This
      GMWB
      feature offers the contractholder a guarantee equal to the initial deposit
      adjusted for any subsequent purchase payments or withdrawals. There are one-year
      and five-year step-up options, which allow the contractholder to step up the
      guarantee. GMWB features are considered to be derivatives under SFAS 133
      resulting in the guarantees being recognized at fair value, with changes in
      fair
      value being reported in net income.

At
      December 31, 2005, we had approximately $1.6 billion of separate account values
      that were attributable to variable annuities with a GIB feature. All of the
      outstanding contracts with a GIB feature are still in the accumulation phase.

Separate
      account balances attributable to variable annuity contracts with guarantees
      are
      as follows:


The
      determination of the GMDB liabilities is based on models that involve a range
      of
      scenarios and assumptions, including those regarding expected market rates
      of
      return and volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality experience.

The
      following table summarizes GMDB liabilities:

The
      changes to the benefit reserves amounts above are reflected in benefits in
      the
      Consolidated Statements of Income.

Also
      included in benefits are the results of the hedging program, which included
      losses of $2.9 million and $19.3 million for GMDB in 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. We implemented a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the income
      statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates,
      and volatility associated with GMWB and the various GMDB features. The hedging
      strategy is designed such that changes in the value of the hedge contracts
      move
      in the opposite direction of changes in the value of the embedded derivative
      of
      the GMWB or changes in the reserve for GMDB contracts subject to the hedging
      strategy. While we actively manages our hedge positions, these hedge positions
      may not be totally effective to offset changes in the embedded derivative due
      to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure
      changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in
      the
      equity markets and interest rates, market volatility, policyholder behavior,
      divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging
      indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge
      instruments, or our ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent
      with its desired risk and return trade-off.

      Benefit Plans

Pension
      and Other Post-retirement Benefit Plans—U.S.

We
      maintain funded defined benefit pension plans for most of our U.S. employees
      and, prior to January 1, 1995, most full-time agents. Effective January 1,
      2002,
      the employees’ pension plan was converted to a cash balance formula. Eligible
      employees retiring before 2012 will have their benefits calculated under both
      the old final average pay formula and the cash balance formula and will receive
      the greater of the two calculations. Employees retiring in 2012 or after will
      receive benefits under the cash balance formula. Benefits under the final
      average pay formula are based on total years of service and the highest 60
      months of compensation during the last 10 years of employment. Under the cash
      balance formula, employees have guaranteed account balances that earn annual
      benefit credits and interest credits each year. Annual benefit credits are
      based
      on years of service and base salary plus bonus. All benefits accruing under
      the
      defined benefit plan for agents were frozen as of December 31, 1994. The plans
      are funded by contributions to tax-exempt trusts. Our funding policy is
      consistent with the funding requirements of Federal law and regulations.
      Contributions are intended to provide not only the benefits attributed to
      service to date, but also those expected to be earned in the future. Effective
      January 1, 2005, we amended the employee’s pension plan to include 100% of
      eligible bonus amounts as compensation under the cash balance formula only.

We
      sponsor three types of unfunded, nonqualified, defined benefit plans for certain
      U.S. employees and agents: supplemental retirement plans, a salary continuation
      plan, and supplemental executive retirement plans. The supplemental retirement
      plans provide defined benefit pension benefits in excess of limits imposed
      by
      Federal tax law.

The
      salary continuation plan provides certain of our officers with a defined pension
      benefit based on years of service and final monthly salary upon death or
      retirement. This plan was frozen as of December 31, 2004. Individuals beginning
      employment after that date are not eligible to participate. In addition,
      effective January 1, 2005, the benefit formula for this plan was changed with
      respect to four executives to improve the level of benefits paid.

The
      supplemental executive retirement plan provides defined pension benefits for
      certain executives who became our employees as a result of the acquisition
      of a
      block of individual life insurance and annuity business from CIGNA Corporation
      (“CIGNA”). Effective January 1, 2000, this plan was amended to freeze benefits
      payable under this plan and a second supplemental executive retirement plan
      was
      established for this same group of executives. The benefits payable to these
      executives under this plan will not be less than they would have been under
      their preacquistion plan. The benefit is based on an average compensation figure
      that is not less than the minimum three-year average compensation figure in
      effect for these


executives
      as of December 31, 1999. Any benefits payable from this plan are reduced by
      benefits payable from our employees’ defined benefit pension plan.

We
      also
      sponsor unfunded plans that provide post-retirement medical, dental and life
      insurance benefits to full-time U.S. employees and agents who, depending on
      the
      plan, have worked for us for 10 years and attained age 55 (60 for agents).
      Medical and dental benefits are also available to spouses and other dependents
      of employees and agents. For medical and dental benefits, limited contributions
      are required from individuals who retired prior to November 1, 1988.
      Contributions for later retirees, which can be adjusted annually, are based
      on
      such items as years of service at retirement and age at retirement. Effective
      April 1, 2004, the employees’ post-retirement plan was amended to provide that
      employees and agents not attaining age 50 by that date will not be eligible
      to
      receive life insurance benefits when they retire. This amendment to the plan
      resulted in the immediate recognition at the end of 2003 of a one-time
      curtailment gain of $2.4 million pre-tax. Life insurance benefits for retirees
      are noncontributory for employees and agents that attained the age of 50 by
      April 1, 2004 and meet the eligibility requirements at the time they retire;
      however, these participants can elect supplemental contributory life benefits
      up
      to age 70. Effective July 1, 1999, the agents’ post-retirement plan was amended
      to require agents retiring on or after that date to pay the full medical and
      dental premium costs. Beginning January 1, 2002, the employees’ post-retirement
      plan was amended to require employees not yet age 50 with five years of service
      by the end of 2001 to pay the full medical and dental premium cost when they
      retire.

The
      Medicare Act became law in 2003. Beginning in 2006, the Medicare Act provides
      various alternatives that could result in an offset to some portion of the
      costs
      of prescription drug benefits provided to retirees. In January 2004, the staff
      of the FASB issued Financial Staff Position No. FAS 106-1, which permits a
      sponsor of a post-retirement health care plan that provides retiree prescription
      drug benefits to make a one-time election to defer accounting for the effects
      of
      the Medicare Act. We elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare
      Act. Accordingly, the measures of accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
      and periodic post-retirement benefit cost in LNC’s 2003 financial statements do
      not reflect the effects of the Medicare Act.

In
      May
      2004, the staff of the FASB issued FSP 106-2, which requires sponsors of a
      post-retirement health care plan that provides retiree prescription drug
      benefits to reflect the provisions of the Medicare Act in determining
      post-retirement benefit cost for the first annual or interim period starting
      after June 15, 2004. We completed our analysis and incorporated the provisions
      of the Medicare Act in determining other post-retirement benefit costs and
      the
      accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation in 2004. The implementation
      did
      not have a material effect on our results of operations.

Pension
      Plan—Non-U.S.

The
      employees of our primary foreign subsidiary are covered by a defined benefit
      pension plan. The plan provides death and pension benefits based on final
      pensionable salary. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, plan assets were under the
      projected benefit obligations by $20.9 million and $83.5 million, respectively.
      We contributed approximately $77 million in 2005 to our U.K. pension plan,
      including approximately $71 million in the fourth quarter. See below (U.S.
      plans) for discussion of the minimum pension liability adjustment for the
      non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan.


Obligations,
      Funded Status and Assumptions

Information
      with respect to U.S. defined benefit plan asset activity and defined benefit
      plan obligations is as follows:

*

In
                2004, other post-retirement benefits of $(98.3) million includes
                a $1.1
                million reduction in expense recorded as the cumulative impact of
                adopting
                FSP 106-2.

We
      use
      December 31

as the
      measurement date for our pension and post-retirement plans.

The
      expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical and expected
      future returns of the various asset classes, using the target plan allocations.
      We reevaluate this assumption at an interim date each plan year.  For 2006,
      our expected return on plan assets for the U.S. pension plan will be
      8%. The calculation of the accumulated post-retirement benefits obligation
      assumes a weighted-average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
      covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) of 13.0% for 2005. It
      further assumes the rate will gradually decrease to 5.0% by 2016 and remain
      at
      that level in future periods. The health care cost trend rate assumption has
      a
      significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, increasing the assumed
      health care cost trend rates by one percentage point each year would increase
      the accumulated post-retirement benefits obligation as of December 31, 2005
      and
      2004 by $8.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The aggregate of the
      estimated service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement
      benefits cost for both 2005 and 2004 would increase by $0.5
      million.


Information
      for our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan
      assets is as follows:

Minimum
      Pension Liability Adjustment

Components
      of Net Periodic Pension Cost

The
      components of net defined benefit pension plan and post-retirement benefit
      plan
      expense are as follows:

We
      maintain a defined contribution plan for our U.S. insurance agents.
      Contributions to this plan are based on a percentage of the agents’ annual
      compensation as defined in the plan. Effective January 1, 1998, we assumed
      the
      liabilities for a non-contributory defined contribution plan covering certain
      highly compensated former CIGNA agents and employees.


Contributions
      to this plan are made annually based upon varying percentages of annual eligible
      earnings as defined in the plan. Contributions to this plan are in lieu of
      any
      contributions to the qualified agent defined contribution plan. Effective
      January 1, 2000, this plan was expanded to include certain highly compensated
      LNC agents. The combined pre-tax expenses for these plans were $3.2 million,
      $3.0 million and $3.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These
      expenses reflect both our contribution as well as changes in the measurement
      of
      our liabilities under these plans.

Plan
      Assets

Our
      U.S.
      pension plan asset allocations at December 31, 2005 and 2004, by asset category
      are as follows:

The
      primary investment objective of our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is for
      capital appreciation and income growth, with an emphasis on avoiding undue
      risk.
      A secondary objective is for current income. Investments can be made using
      the
      following asset classes: both domestic and international equity and fixed income
      securities, real estate, guaranteed products, venture capital, oil and gas,
      as
      well as any other asset classes the investment managers deem prudent. A
      five-year time horizon is utilized as there are inevitably short-run
      fluctuations, which will cause variations in investment performance.

Each
      managed fund is expected to rank in the upper 50% of similar funds over the
      relevant three and/or five-year periods. Managers not meeting these criteria
      will be subject to additional due diligence review and possible termination.
      The
      following short-term ranges have been established for weightings in the various
      asset categories:

The
      total
      of domestic cash, domestic fixed income, and domestic equities shall not be
      less
      than 50%.

*

Currency
                exposure can be hedged up to 100%

**

International/Emerging
                Markets-Fixed Income and Equities

Within
      the broad ranges provided above, we currently target asset weightings as
      follows: 64% equities, 35% fixed income, including real estate, and 1% cash.
      The
      performance of the plan and the managed funds are monitored on a quarterly


basis
      relative to the plan’s objectives. The performance of the managed fund is
      measured against the following indices: S&P 500, EAFE, Russell 2000, NAREIT,
      Lehman US Universal and Salomon (Citigroup) 90-day T-Bill. We review this
      investment policy on an annual basis.

Our
      plan
      assets are principally managed by our Investment Management segment.

Plan
      Cash Flows

We
      expect
      to contribute between $0 and $19 million to our qualified U.S. defined benefit
      pension plan in 2006. In addition, we expect to fund approximately the following
      amounts for benefit payments for our unfunded non-qualified U.S. defined benefit
      plan, U.S. post-retirement benefit plans and non-U.S. defined benefit pension
      plan:

401(k),
      Money Purchase and Profit Sharing Plans.

We also
      sponsor contributory defined contribution plans for eligible U.S. employees
      and
      agents. These plans include 401(k) plans and effective April 1, 2001, a defined
      contribution money purchase plan for eligible employees of Delaware Management
      Holdings, Inc. (“Delaware”). Our contribution to the 401(k) plans is equal to
      50% of each participant’s pre-tax contribution, not to exceed 6% of base pay
      plus cash bonus, and is invested as directed by the participant. An additional
      discretionary contribution of up to 100% may be made with respect to a
      participant’s pre-tax contribution (again up to 6% of base pay plus cash bonus).
      The amount of discretionary contribution varies according to whether we have
      met
      certain performance-based criteria as determined by the Compensation Committee
      of our Board of Directors. The additional discretionary contributions are in
      our
      stock.

Our
      contribution to Delaware’s defined contribution money purchase plan is equal to
      7.5% per annum of each participant’s eligible compensation. For any plan year,
      eligible compensation is defined as 100% of an eligible participant’s base
      salary, plus bonus. The amount of bonus is capped such that only 50% of the
      bonus amounts over $100,000 are considered eligible compensation. Eligible
      compensation for both the 401(k) and money purchase plans is subject to various
      limitations under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
      amended.

Expense
      for the 401(k) and profit sharing plans amounted to $39.2 million, $38.5 million
      and $36.1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Deferred
      Compensation Plans.

We
      sponsor deferred compensation plans for certain U.S. employees and agents.
      Plan
      participants may elect to defer payment of a portion of their compensation,
      as
      defined by the plans. Plan participants may select from a menu of “phantom”
investment options (identical to those offered under our qualified savings
      plans) used as investment measures for calculating the investment return
      notionally credited to their deferrals. Under the terms of these plans, we
      agree
      to pay out amounts based upon the aggregate performance of the investment
      measures selected by the participant. We make matching contributions to these
      plans based upon amounts placed into the deferred compensation plans


by
      individuals. The amount of our contribution is calculated in a manner similar
      to
      the employer match calculation described in the 401(k) plans section above.
      Expense for these plans amounted to $16.7 million, $14.4 million and $28.7
      million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These expenses reflect both our
      employer matching contributions of $7.3 million, $7.3 million and $6.4 million,
      respectively, as well as increases in the measurement of our liabilities net
      of
      the total return swap, described below, under these plans of $9.4 million,
      $7.1
      million and $22.3 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
      terms
      of the deferred compensation plans provide that plan participants who select
      our
      stock as the measure for their investment return will receive shares of LNC
      stock in settlement of this portion of their accounts at the time of
      distribution. In addition, participants are precluded from diversifying any
      portion of their deferred compensation plan account that has been credited
      to
      the stock unit fund. Consequently, changes in value of our stock do not affect
      the expenses associated with this portion of the deferred compensation plans.

In
      2004,
      we established a deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors. The
      plan
      allows directors to defer a portion of their annual retainers into the plan
      and,
      in addition, we credit deferred stock units annually. The menu of “phantom”
investment options is identical to those offered to the employees and agents.
      The liability associated with this plan was $7.8 million and $0.2 million at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amounts previously recorded as
      liabilities of $1.6 million were reclassified to equity in 2005 for the deferred
      compensation payable in LNC stock.

Prior
      to
      2003, we made investments aggregating $60 million in a variable annuity contract
      with investment options similar to the investment options within the deferred
      compensation plans, with the objective of partially mitigating the earnings
      effects created by changes in the value of our deferred compensation plan
      liabilities. The value of the deferred compensation liability and the variable
      annuity were both marked to market through net income. Income for the change
      in
      value of the variable annuity contract was $14.7 million in 2003. In June 2004,
      we withdrew our variable annuity contract, which had a value of $65.4 million,
      and entered into a total return swap agreement with a notional amount of $82.5
      million and paid no initial premium. We are using the total return swap to
      mitigate the earnings effects created by the changes in value of our deferred
      compensation plan liability that result from changes in value of the underlying
      investment options.

The
      total
      liabilities associated with the employee and agent plans were $192.1 million
      and
      $165.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amounts previously
      recorded as liabilities, $50.4 million, were re-classified to equity in 2004
      for
      the deferred compensation payable in LNC stock.

Stock-Based
      Incentive Compensation Plans.

We have
      various incentive plans for the employees, agents and directors that provide
      for
      the issuance of stock options, stock incentive awards, stock appreciation
      rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“performance shares”),
      and deferred stock units.

Delaware
      Investments U.S., Inc. (“DIUS”) has a separate stock option incentive plan.
      Information with respect to stock option and performance share awards granted
      under these plans is provided in the table below.

Effective
      January 1, 2003, LNC began to provide for performance vesting of employee awards
      under its Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated on March 8,
      2001—the “performance shares” referred to above. The performance measures that
      must be met for vesting to occur are established at the beginning of each
      three-year performance period. Depending on the performance results for the
      relevant period, the actual amount of stock options and performance share units
      awarded could range from zero to 200% of the granted amount. For the 2005 -
      cycle, certain participants in the plan selected from seven different
      combinations of stock options, shares and/or cash to determine the form of
      their
      award. All other participants will have their award paid in shares.

Total
      compensation expense for performance vesting awards for 2005 was $3.4 million
      relating to stock options, $25.1 million relating to shares and $4.1 million
      relating to cash awards. Total compensation expense for performance vesting


awards
      for 2004 was $2.1 million relating to stock options, $20.4 million relating
      to
      shares and $2.5 million relating to cash awards. The amount of stock option
      expense for the performance vesting awards is included in the total of our
      stock
      option expense as discussed below. All expense calculations for performance
      vesting stock options, shares, and cash awards that were granted in 2005 and
      2004 have been based upon the fair value at date of grant and an estimate of
      performance achievement over the three-year performance measurement periods.
      The
      estimated cost for each award cycle is expensed over the performance period.
      As
      the three-year performance periods progress, we refine our estimate of the
      expense associated with these awards so that by the end of the three-year
      performance period, our cumulative expense will reflect the actual level of
      awards that vest.

Stock
      options awarded under the stock option incentive plans in effect prior to 2003
      were granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of our stock
      at
      the grant date and, unless cancelled earlier due to certain terminations of
      employment, expire 10 years from the date of grant. Such options are generally
      transferable only upon death unless otherwise permitted by the Compensation
      Committee of our Board of Directors. Options become exercisable in 25%
      increments over the four-year period following the option grant anniversary
      date. A “reload option” feature was added on May 14, 1997. In most cases,
      persons exercising an option after that date using shares of stock have been
      granted new options in an amount equal to the number of matured shares tendered
      to exercise the original option award. The reload options are granted for the
      remaining term of the related original option and have an exercise price equal
      to the market value of our stock at the date of the reload award. Reload options
      can be exercised two years after the grant date if the value of the new option
      has appreciated by at least 25%, or if the reload option expires within 2 years,
      in which case the options become exercisable one month prior to expiration.
      The
      reload feature is not available for options granted after 2002.

Information
      with respect to our stock options outstanding at December 31, 2005 is as
      follows:

The
      option price assumptions used for our stock option incentive plans were as
      follows:


Information
      with respect to our incentive plans involving stock options is as follows:

Total
      compensation expense for our incentive plans involving stock options, including
      the DIUS stock option incentive plans discussed below, for 2005, 2004 and 2003
      was $26.7 million, $34.0 million and $51.5 million, respectively. Included
      in
      the above compensation is the acceleration of expense resulting from the 2004
      and 2003 realignment activities.

Delaware
      Stock Option Incentive Plans:

In
      2001,
      Delaware Management Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its wholly-owned
      subsidiaries DIUS and Delaware International Advisers Limited (“DIAL”),
      established separate stock option incentive plans for its domestic and
      international personnel, respectively. As discussed in Note 12, Holdings
      completed the sale of DIAL in September 2004. No DIAL options had been exercised
      prior to the sale. At the closing, the buyer assumed responsibility for the
      DIAL
      option plan. Stock options awarded under the DIUS plan are granted with an
      exercise price equal to the estimated fair market value per share at the date
      of
      the grant, as determined by the Compensation Committee with the assistance
      of an
      outside appraiser, and expire 10 years from the date of the grant, subject
      to
      conditions of the plan agreements. Options granted under the DIUS plan become
      exercisable and vest in 25% increments over the four-year period following
      the
      option grant anniversary date.

Shares
      acquired upon exercise, provided they have been held for more than six months,
      may be “put” to Holdings at the most recent determined fair market value per
      share, subject to the specific terms of the plan agreements. Additionally,
      shares acquired upon exercise, provided they have been held for more than six
      months, may be “called” by Holdings or DIUS, as applicable, at the most recent
      determined fair market value per share. Fair market value is determined using
      a
      market transaction approach based on profit margin, assets under management
      and
      revenues. The valuation is performed by an outside appraiser at least
      semi-annually and reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The last valuation
      was
      performed as of June 30, 2005 with a value of $143.17 per share.

The
      option price assumptions used for the DIUS stock option incentive plan was
      as
      follows:


At
      December 31, 2005, DIUS had 10,093,896 shares of common stock outstanding.
      Information with respect to the options outstanding and options exercisable
      under the DIUS incentive stock option plan is as follows:

At
      December 31, 2005, options outstanding under the DIUS stock option incentive
      plan were exercisable at prices ranging from $112.02 to $144.79 with a
      weighted-average remaining contractual life of 7.6 years. The exercise prices
      reflect an adjustment of $(13.31) resulting from an amendment to the DIUS stock
      option incentive plan in 2005 as a result of the sale of DIAL.

Stock
      Appreciation Rights Incentive Plan.

Under
      our
      Incentive Compensation Plan, we issue stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) to
      certain agents who have full-time contracts with us. The SARs under this program
      are rights on our stock that are cash settled and become exercisable in 25%
      increments over the four-year period following the SAR grant date. SARs are
      granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock
      at
      the date of grant and, unless cancelled earlier due to certain terminations
      of
      employment, expire five years from the date of grant. Generally, such SARs
      are
      transferable only upon death.

We
      recognize compensation expense for the SAR program based on the fair value
      method using an option-pricing model. Compensation expense and the related
      liability are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of
      the
      SARs. The liability for SARs is marked-to-market through net income. This
      accounting treatment causes volatility in net income as a result of changes
      in
      the market value of our stock. We hedge this volatility by purchasing call
      options on our stock. Call options hedging vested SARs are also marked-to-market
      through net income. Total compensation expense recognized for the SAR program
      for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $4.5 million, $6.2 million and $6.8 million,
      respectively. The mark-to-market gain recognized through net income on the
      call
      options on our stock for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $2.8 million, $2.4 million
      and
      $0.3 million, respectively. The liability for SARs was $8.5 million and $9.4
      million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.


Information
      with respect to our SARs incentive plan at December 31, 2005 is as follows:

The option price assumptions used for our SAR plan were
        as
        follows:


Information
      with respect to our SAR plan is as follows:

In
      addition to the stock-based incentives discussed above, we have awarded
      restricted shares of our stock (non-vested stock) under the incentive
      compensation plan, generally subject to a three-year vesting period. The fair
      market value at date of grant of the restricted shares is expensed over the
      vesting period. Information with respect to our restricted stock awarded from
      2003 through 2005 was as follows:

      Restrictions, Commitments and Contingencies

Statutory
      Information and Restrictions

Net
      income as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices for
      our
      insurance subsidiaries was $742 million, $599 million and $237 million for
      2005,
      2004 and 2003, respectively. Statutory surplus as determined in accordance
      with
      statutory accounting practices for our insurance subsidiaries was $4.0 billion
      and $3.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The
      state
      of Indiana has adopted certain prescribed accounting practices that differ
      from
      those found in NAIC statutory accounting practices and effect the reported
      statutory surplus for LNL. LNL utilizes the Indiana universal life method to
      calculate reserves for universal life, which increased statutory surplus by
      $210
      million and $272 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. LNL also
      uses a permitted valuation interest rate on certain annuities, which
      decreased statutory surplus by $15 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Our
      insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory
      restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding
      company. Generally, these restrictions pose no short-term liquidity concerns
      for
      the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance
      subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends
      to LNC only from unassigned surplus, without prior approval of the Indiana
      Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), or must receive prior approval of
      the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other
      dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months, would exceed
      the
      statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of (i)
      10%
      of the insurer’s policyholders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement
      on file with the Commissioner or (ii) the insurer’s statutory net gain from
      operations for the previous twelve months, but in no event to exceed statutory
      unassigned surplus. Indiana law gives Commissioner broad discretion to
      disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits.


LNL
      paid
      dividends of $200 million and $150 million to LNC during 2005 and 2004,
      respectively, which did not require prior approval of the Commissioner. Based
      upon anticipated on-going positive statutory earnings and favorable credit
      markets, LNL expects it could pay dividends of $468 million in 2006 without
      prior approval from the Commissioner. LNL paid dividends of $200 million to
      LNC
      during 2003. Dividends paid by LNL in 2003 were subject to prior approval from
      the Commissioner because LNL had negative statutory earned surplus as of
      December 31, 2002.

LNL
      is
      recognized as an accredited reinsurer in the state of New York, which
      effectively enables it to conduct reinsurance business with unrelated insurance
      companies that are domiciled within the state of New York. As a result, in
      addition to regulatory restrictions imposed by the state of Indiana, LNL is
      also
      subject to the regulatory requirements that the State of New York imposes upon
      authorized insurers. These include reserve requirements, which differ from
      Indiana’s requirements.

The
      New
      York regulations require LNL to report more reserves to the state of New York.
      As a result, the level of statutory surplus that LNL reports to New York is
      less
      than the statutory surplus reported to Indiana and the National Association
      of
      Insurance Commissioners. If New York requires us to maintain a higher level
      of
      capital to remain an accredited reinsurer in New York, LNL’s ability to pay
      dividends to us could be constrained. However, we do not expect that LNL’s
      ability to pay dividends during 2006 will be constrained as a result of our
      status in New York.

Lincoln
      UK’s operations consist primarily of unit-linked life and pension products,
      which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products. Lincoln
      UK’s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the U.K. Financial Services
      Authority (FSA) and are subject to capital requirements as defined by the U.K.
      Capital Resources Requirement (formerly the Required Minimum Solvency Margin).
      Lincoln UK maintains approximately 1.5 to 2 times the required capital as
      prescribed by the regulatory resources requirement. Effective January 1, 2005,
      all insurance companies operating in the U.K have to complete an RBC assessment
      to demonstrate to the FSA that they hold sufficient capital to cover their
      risks. RBC requirements in the U.K. are different than the NAIC requirements.
      In
      addition, the FSA has imposed certain minimum capital requirements for the
      combined U.K. subsidiaries. As is the case with regulated insurance companies
      in
      the U.S., changes to regulatory capital requirements can impact the dividend
      capacity of the UK insurance subsidiaries and cash flow to us. During 2005,
      Lincoln UK paid dividends of $44.3 million to LNC.

Reinsurance
      Contingencies

In
      2001,
      Swiss Re acquired our reinsurance operation and personal accident business
      through indemnity reinsurance transactions. We recorded the gain related to
      the
      indemnity reinsurance transactions on the business sold to Swiss Re as deferred
      gain in the liability section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance
      with the requirements of SFAS No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance
      of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts” (“SFAS 113”). The deferred gain
      is being amortized into income at the rate that earnings on the reinsured
      business are expected to emerge, over a period of 15 years. During 2005, 2004
      and 2003 we amortized $50.1 million, after-tax ($77.0 million pre-tax), $57.4
      million, after-tax ($88.3 million, pre-tax) and $49.3 million, after-tax ($75.8
      million, pre-tax) respectively, of deferred gain on the sale of the reinsurance
      operation.

As
      a
      result of developments and information received in the third quarter of 2003
      relating to personal accident matters, we increased reserves on this exited
      business by $20.9 million, after-tax ($32.1 million pre-tax) with a
      corresponding increase in reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re and in the
      deferred gain. In the third quarter of 2004, we adjusted the deferred gain
      up by
      $77 million. As a result, the amortization of the deferred gain in 2004 included
      an adjustment upward of $9.1 million after-tax.

Because
      of ongoing uncertainty related to personal accident business, the reserves
      related to these exited business lines carried on our balance sheet at December
      31, 2005 may ultimately prove to be either excessive or deficient. For instance,
      in the event that future developments indicate that these reserves should be
      increased, under SFAS 113 LNC would record a current period non-cash charge
      to
      record the increase in reserves. Because Swiss Re is responsible for paying
      the
      underlying claims to the ceding companies, we would record a corresponding
      increase in reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re. However, SFAS 113 does not
      permit us to take the full benefit in earnings for the recording of the increase
      in the reinsurance recoverable in the period of the change. Rather, we would
      increase the deferred gain recognized upon the closing of the indemnity
      reinsurance transaction with Swiss Re and would report a cumulative amortization
      “catch-up” adjustment to the deferred gain balance as increased earnings
      recognized in the period of change. Any amount of additional increase to the
      deferred gain above the cumulative amortization “catch-up” adjustment must
      continue to be deferred and will be amortized into income in future periods
      over
      the remaining period of expected run-off of the underlying business. We would
      transfer no cash to Swiss Re as a result of these developments.


Accordingly,
      even though we have no continuing underwriting risk, and no cash would be
      transferred to Swiss Re, in the event that future developments indicate our
      December 31, 2005 personal accident reserves are deficient or redundant, SFAS
      113 requires us to adjust earnings in the period of change, with only a partial
      offset to earnings for the cumulative deferred gain amortization adjustment
      in
      the period of change. The remaining amount of increased gain would be amortized
      into earnings over the remaining run-off period of the underlying business.

Our
      amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves
      ceded to reinsurers. We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers
      and monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our principal
      reinsurers. Our principal reinsurers are strongly rated companies, with Swiss
      Re
      representing the largest exposure. We sold our reinsurance business to Swiss
      Re
      primarily through indemnity reinsurance arrangements in 2001. Because we are
      not
      relieved of our liability to the ceding companies for this business, the
      liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured contracts remain
      on
      our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable
      from
      Swiss Re, which totaled $4.1 billion at December 31, 2005, and is included
      in
      amounts recoverable from reinsurers. Swiss Re has funded a trust, with a balance
      of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2005, to support this business.

In
      addition to various remedies that we would have in the event of a default by
      Swiss Re, we continue to hold assets in support of certain of the transferred
      reserves. These assets consist of those reported as trading securities and
      certain mortgage loans. Our funds withheld and embedded derivative liabilities
      at December 31, 2005 included $2.0 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively,
      related to the business reinsured by Swiss Re.

United
      Kingdom Selling Practices

Various
      selling practices of the Lincoln UK operations have come under scrutiny by
      the
      U.K. regulators. These include the sale and administration of individual pension
      products and mortgage endowments. Regarding the sale and administration of
      pension products to individuals, regulatory agencies have raised questions
      as to
      what constitutes appropriate advice to individuals who bought pension products
      as an alternative to participation in an employer-sponsored plan. In cases
      of
      alleged inappropriate advice, an extensive investigation has been or is being
      carried out and the individual put in a position similar to what would have
      been
      attained if the individual had remained in an employer-sponsored plan.

The
      Treasury Select Committee published a report in the first quarter of 2004 on
      various issues associated with mortgage endowment contracts. In response to
      this
      report, in the second quarter of 2004, the FSA revised its rules relating to
      the
      time limits for making a complaint regarding the sale of these contracts. The
      heightened publicity surrounding these matters has contributed to an increase
      in
      the level of customer complaints, which were in excess of expected levels in
      the
      first six months of 2004. As a direct result of this experience and the likely
      impact of the FSA’s revised rules on time limits, Lincoln UK increased its
      reserves for these matters during the second quarter of 2004.

Also
      in
      2004, Lincoln UK reached a favorable settlement with three liability carriers
      for reimbursement of certain costs incurred in connection with certain United
      Kingdom selling practices. The combined effect of the increase to mis-selling
      reserves referred to above and the favorable settlement resulted in a $9.0
      million pre-tax ($5.9 million after-tax) increase in net income.

Based
      upon our evaluation in 2005, we further increased the reserve for selling
      practice matters by $11 million pre-tax ($7.2 million after-tax) as a result
      of
      greater than expected levels of customer complaints. During 2005, there was
      aggressive marketing by companies seeking to pursue claims on behalf of
      individual policyholders prior to the expiration of time limits for making
      complaint.

At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, the aggregate liability associated with Lincoln
      UK
      selling practices was $13.4 million and $27.4 million, respectively. On an
      ongoing basis, Lincoln UK evaluates various assumptions underlying these
      estimated liabilities, including the expected levels of future complaints and
      the potential implications with respect to the adequacy of the aggregate
      liability associated with UK selling practice matters. Any changes in the
      regulatory position on time limits for making a complaint regarding the sale
      of
      mortgage endowment contracts or higher than expected levels of complaints may
      result in Lincoln UK revising its estimate of the required level of these
      liabilities. The reserves for these issues are based on various estimates that
      are subject to considerable uncertainty. Future changes in complaint levels
      could effect Lincoln UK’s ultimate exposure to mis-selling issues, although we
      believe that any future change would not materially effect our consolidated
      financial position.

In
      addition, we have successfully pursued claims with some of our liability
      carriers for reimbursement of certain costs incurred in connection with certain
      United Kingdom selling practices. We are continuing to pursue claims with
      liability carriers.


Marketing
      and Compliance Issues

There
      continues to be a significant amount of federal and state regulatory activity
      in
      the industry relating to numerous issues including, but not limited to, market
      timing and late trading of mutual fund and variable insurance products and
      broker-dealer access arrangements. Like others in the industry, we have received
      inquiries including requests for information and/or subpoenas from various
      authorities including the SEC, NASD, and the New York Attorney General, as
      well
      as notices of potential proceedings from the SEC and NASD. We are in the process
      of responding to, and in some cases have settled or are in the process of
      settling, certain of these inquiries and potential proceedings. We continue
      to
      cooperate fully with such authorities.

Regulators
      also continue to focus on replacement and exchange issues. Under certain
      circumstances companies have been held responsible for replacing existing
      policies with policies that were less advantageous to the policyholder. We
      continue to monitor compliance procedures to minimize any potential liability.
      Due to the uncertainty surrounding all of these matters, it is not possible
      to
      provide a meaningful estimate of the range of potential outcomes; however it
      is
      management’s opinion that future developments will not materially affect our
      consolidated financial position.

Leases

Certain
      of our subsidiaries lease their home office properties through sale-leaseback
      agreements. The agreements provide for a 25-year lease period with options
      to
      renew for six additional terms of five years each. The agreements also provide
      us with the right of first refusal to purchase the properties during the terms
      of the lease, including renewal periods, at a price defined in the agreements.
      We also have the option to purchase the leased properties at fair market value
      as defined in the agreements on the last day of the initial 25-year lease period
      ending in 2009 or the last day of any of the renewal periods.

Total
      rental expense on operating leases in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $64.6 million,
      $66.3 million and $67.1 million, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments
      are as follows (in millions):

2006 –     $65.2

2008 –    $64.4

2010 –             
                    $43.5

2007 –
                          70.9

                    –      54.4

Thereafter –    
                     25.9

Information
      Technology Commitment

In
      February 1998, we signed a seven-year contract with IBM Global Services for
      information technology services for the Fort Wayne operations. In February
      2004,
      we completed renegotiations and extended the contract through February 2010.
      Annual costs are dependent on usage but are expected to range from $45 million
      to $50 million.

Lincoln
      UK Outsourcing Agreement

Lincoln
      UK agreed to outsource its customer and policy administration functions to
      the
      Capita Group Plc (“Capita”) on August 1, 2002. The contract was originally for a
      term of 10 years. During 2003, this agreement was converted to an evergreen
      contract. The annual cost is based on a per-policy charge plus an amount for
      other services provided. The total costs over the next 10 years of the contract
      are estimated to be $276 million and annual costs over the next five years
      are
      estimated to decline from $31 million to $29 million. The amounts quoted are
      estimates, as the actual cost will depend on the number of policies in force
      and
      the applicable inflation rate for the period concerned. Lincoln UK or Capita
      may
      terminate the contract, subject to the necessary conditions being satisfied,
      by
      serving six and 12 months notice, respectively.

The
      services provided to the segment under the Capita agreement are currently deemed
      to be exempt from value added tax (“VAT”). In a recent ruling by the European
      Court of Justice regarding a similar arrangement involving a Dutch insurer,
      it
      was deemed that VAT should be applied to such an arrangement. The U.K.
      authorities are required to take note of this ruling in determining U.K.
      legislation and in July 2005 issued a consultation paper outlining their
      intention to amend U.K. legislation so that VAT applies to contracts, such
      as
      our arrangement with Capita. In December 2005, U.K. authorities postponed their
      decision to implement legislation until after the European Commission has
      completed its review of the VAT treatment of insurance and financial services.
      It is uncertain when this review will be completed and what the outcome will
      be.
      Future changes in the application of VAT to Lincoln UK’s outsourcing arrangement
      with Capita could impact the segment’s results, although we believe that any
      future change would not materially effect our consolidated financial
      position.

In
      return
      for agreeing to outsource its customer and policy administration functions
      to
      Capita, the agreement with Capita included payments that we could receive upon
      the achievement of certain contingencies. In 2004, we exercised our put options
      and recognized a gain of $10.1 million pre-tax ($6.6 million after-tax), in
      respect of the future contingent payments


under
      this arrangement. In 2005, we reached an agreement to settle in full the
      residual contingent payments under this arrangement, resulting in a gain of
      $14.2 million pre-tax ($9.2 million after-tax).

Football
      Stadium Naming Rights Commitment

In
      2002,
      we announced an agreement with the Philadelphia Eagles to name the Eagles’ new
      stadium Lincoln Financial Field. In exchange for the naming rights, we agreed
      to
      pay $139.6 million over a 20-year period through annual payments to the Eagles,
      which average approximately $6.7 million per year. The total amount includes
      a
      maximum annual increase related to the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”). This future
      commitment has not been recorded as a liability in our balance sheet as it
      is
      being accounted for in a manner consistent with the accounting for operating
      leases under SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.”

Human
      Resources Outsourcing Agreement

We
      agreed
      to outsource our human resources administration functions, including payroll,
      to
      IBM in 2003. The contract is for a term of 10 years and the annual cost is
      based
      on per check and per employee charges. The total costs over the life of the
      contract are estimated to be $37 million, including $28 million over the
      remainder of the contract from December 31, 2005. Annual costs over the next
      five years are estimated to decline from $4.2 million to $3.3 million. The
      actual cost will depend on the number of active employees and the applicable
      inflation rate for the period concerned.

Procurement
      Outsourcing Agreement

In
      November 2004, we entered into a five-year procurement management arrangement
      with Accenture LLP. Payments under the arrangement are expected to total $25.8
      million over the contract term, including a technology access fee of $3 million
      paid in 2004, aggregate operating fees of $13.8 million, ranging between $3.2
      million and $1.9 million per year, and incentive fees aggregating $9.0 million
      if targeted savings over the contract period are achieved. Depending on the
      actual level of savings achieved over the contract period, the incentive fee
      could range from zero to $14.0 million.

Insurance
      Ceded and Assumed

Our
      insurance companies cede insurance to other companies. The portion of risks
      exceeding each company’s retention limit is reinsured with other insurers. We
      seek reinsurance coverage within the businesses that sell life insurance to
      limit its liabilities. We reinsure approximately 85% to 90% of the mortality
      risk on fully underwritten newly issued life insurance contracts. Our current
      policy is to retain no more than $5.0 million on a single insured life issued
      on
      fixed and variable universal life insurance contracts. Additionally, the
      retention per single insured life for term life insurance and for Corporate
      Owned Life Insurance (COLI) is $1 million and $2 million, respectively. Portions
      of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a Modco basis with
      other
      companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks. At December 31, 2005,
      the reserves associated with these reinsurance arrangements totaled $2.2
      billion. To cover products other than life insurance, we acquire other insurance
      coverages with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate
      for the circumstances. The accompanying financial statements reflect premiums,
      benefits and deferred acquisition costs, net of insurance ceded (see Note 6).
      Our insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet
      contractual obligations under applicable reinsurance agreements.

Certain
      of our insurance companies assume insurance from other companies. At December
      31, 2005, our insurance companies provided $56.2 million of statutory surplus
      relief to other insurance companies under reinsurance transactions. Generally,
      such amounts are offset by corresponding receivables from the ceding company,
      which are secured by future profits on the reinsured business. However, our
      insurance companies are subject to the risk that the ceding company may become
      insolvent and the right of offset would not be permitted. Our reinsurance
      operations were acquired by Swiss Re in December 2001, through a series of
      indemnity reinsurance transactions. Under the indemnity reinsurance agreements,
      Swiss Re reinsured certain of our liabilities and obligations. Because we are
      not relieved of our legal liability to the ceding companies, the liabilities
      and
      obligations associated with the reinsured contracts remain on our balance sheets
      with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from Swiss Re.

Letters
      of Credit

We
      maintain a $900 million letter of credit facility to issue standby letters
      of
      credit on behalf of our subsidiaries and for the benefit of third parties.
      The
      term of the LOC facility is five years. These LOCs support our reinsurance
      needs
      and specific treaties associated with our reinsurance business acquired by
      Swiss
      Re in 2001. LOCs are primarily used to satisfy


the
      U.S.
      regulatory requirements of domestic clients of the former Reinsurance segment
      who have contracted with the reinsurance subsidiaries not domiciled in the
      United States and for the reserve credit provided by our affiliated offshore
      reinsurance company to our domestic insurance companies for ceded business.
      The
      LOC allows the cedents to take credit for reinsured reserves on their statutory
      balance sheets. At December 31, 2005, there was a total of $848.5 million in
      outstanding LOCs.

In
      February 2006, we entered into the 2006 Credit Agreement with a group of banks
      that allows for borrowing or issuance of letters of credit of up to $1.0
      billion. See Note 6 for additional information.

LNL
      is
      actively exploring strategies to lessen the burden of increased AXXX reserves
      associated with its universal life lapse protection rider (“LPR”) product.
      Strategies include both reinsurance and capital markets solutions that provide
      for risk transfer and associated reserve and surplus relief. Currently, this
      business is reinsured with a non-U.S. domiciled subsidiary. At December 31,
      2005, there were approximately $545 million in outstanding LOCs under the bank
      agreements supporting the reinsurance obligations of our non-U.S. domiciled
      subsidiary to LNL on this LPR business.

Vulnerability
      from Concentrations

At
      December 31, 2005, we did not have a material concentration of financial
      instruments in a single investee or industry. Our investments in mortgage loans
      principally involve commercial real estate. At December 31, 2005, 27% of such
      mortgages, or $1 billion, involved properties located in California and Texas.
      Such investments consist of first mortgage liens on completed income-producing
      properties and the mortgage outstanding on any individual property does not
      exceed $37 million. Also at December 31, 2005, we did not have a concentration
      of: 1) business transactions with a particular customer or lender; 2) sources
      of
      supply of labor or services used in the business or; 3) a market or geographic
      area in which business is conducted that makes it vulnerable to an event that
      is
      at least reasonably possible to occur in the near term and which could cause
      a
      severe impact to our financial position.

Although
      we do not have any significant concentration of customers, our Lincoln
      Retirement segment has had a long-standing distribution relationship with
      American Funds Distributors (“AFD”) that is significant to this segment. Prior
      to 2003, AFD used wholesalers who focus on both American Funds mutual funds
      as
      well as the American Legacy Variable Annuity products. In 2002, AFD agreed
      with
      us to transition the wholesaling of American Legacy to Lincoln Financial
      Distributors (“LFD”), which was completed in 2003. The American Legacy Variable
      Annuity product line sold through LFD accounted for about 39%, 33% and 19%
      of
      LNC’s total gross annuity deposits in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In
      addition, the American Legacy Variable Annuity product line represents
      approximately 41% and 38% of our total gross annuity account values at December
      31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Other
      Contingency Matters

We
      and
      our subsidiaries are involved in various pending or threatened legal
      proceedings, including purported class actions, arising from the conduct of
      business. In some instances, these proceedings include claims for unspecified
      or
      substantial punitive damages and similar types of relief in addition to amounts
      for alleged contractual liability or requests for equitable relief. After
      consultation with legal counsel and a review of available facts, it is
      management’s opinion that these proceedings ultimately will be resolved without
      materially affecting our consolidated financial position.

State
      guaranty funds assess insurance companies to cover losses to policyholders
      of
      insolvent or rehabilitated companies. Mandatory assessments may be partially
      recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states. We have
      accrued for expected assessments net of estimated future premium tax deductions.

Guarantees

We
      have
      guarantees with off-balance-sheet risks having contractual values of $3.8
      million and $4.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, whose
      contractual amounts represent credit exposure.  Certain of our subsidiaries
      have sold commercial mortgage loans through grantor trusts, which issued
      pass-through certificates. These subsidiaries have agreed to repurchase any
      mortgage loans which remain delinquent for 90 days at a repurchase price
      substantially equal to the outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest
      thereon to the date of repurchase. In case of default by borrowers, we have
      recourse to the underlying real estate. It is management’s opinion that the
      value of the properties underlying these commitments is sufficient that in
      the
      event of default, the impact would not be material to us. These guarantees
      expire in 2009.


We
      guarantee the repayment of operating leases on facilities which we have
      subleased to third parties. These guarantees obligate us to make payments in
      the
      event the third parties fail to perform their payment obligations under the
      subleasing agreements. We have recourse to the third parties enabling us to
      recover any amounts paid under our guarantees. The annual rental payments
      subject to these guarantees are $14.5 million and expire in 2009.

Derivative
      Instruments

We
      maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of
      derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in
      earnings that are caused by interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, equity
      risk, and credit risk. We assess these risks by continually identifying and
      monitoring changes in interest rate exposure, foreign currency exposure, equity
      market exposure, and credit exposure that may adversely impact expected future
      cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. Derivative instruments
      that
      are currently used as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include
      interest rate swaps, interest rate futures and interest rate caps. Derivative
      instruments that are used as part of our foreign currency risk management
      strategy include foreign currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards. Call
      options on our stock, total return swaps, put options and equity futures are
      used as part of our equity market risk management strategy. We also use credit
      default swaps as part of our credit risk management strategy.

By
      using
      derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the
      counterparty fails to perform, credit risk is equal to the extent of the fair
      value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract
      is
      positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore,
      creates a payment risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract
      is
      negative, we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no payment risk. We
      minimize the credit (or payment) risk in derivative instruments by entering
      into
      transactions with high quality counterparties that we review regularly. We
      also
      maintain a policy of requiring that all derivative contracts be governed by
      an
      International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement.

LNL
      and
      we are required to maintain minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice
      in
      negotiating ISDA agreements. Under the majority of ISDA agreements and as a
      matter of policy, LNL has agreed to maintain financial strength or claims-paying
      ratings above S&P BBB and Moody’s Baa2. A downgrade below these levels would
      result in termination of the derivatives contract at which time any amounts
      payable by us would be dependent on the market value of the underlying
      derivative contract. In certain transactions, the counterparty and LNL have
      entered into a collateral support agreement requiring us to post collateral
      upon
      significant downgrade. We are required to maintain long-term senior debt ratings
      of S&P BBB- and Moody’s Baa3. We also require for our own protection minimum
      rating standards for counterparty credit protection. LNL is required to maintain
      financial strength or claims-paying ratings above S&P A- and Moody’s A3
      under certain ISDA agreements, which collectively do not represent material
      notional exposure. We do not believe the inclusion of termination or
      collateralization events poses any material threat to our liquidity position.

Market
      risk is the adverse effect that a change in interest rates, currency rates,
      implied volatility rates, or a change in certain equity indexes or instruments
      has on the value of a financial instrument. We manage the market risk by
      establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that
      may
      be undertaken.

Our
      derivative instruments are monitored by our risk management committee as part
      of
      that committee’s oversight of our derivative activities. Our derivative
      instruments committee is responsible for implementing various hedging strategies
      that are developed through its analysis of financial simulation models and
      other
      internal and industry sources. The resulting hedging strategies are incorporated
      into our overall risk management strategies.


We
      have
      derivative instruments with off-balance-sheet risks whose notional or contract
      amounts exceed the credit exposure. Outstanding derivative instruments with
      off-balance-sheet risks, shown in notional or contract amounts along with their
      carrying value and estimated fair values, are as follows:

*

Total
                derivative instruments for 2005 were composed of an asset of $174.7
                million recorded in derivative investments, a $5.9 million liability
                recorded in insurance policy and claim reserves and a liability of
                $292.2
                million recorded in reinsurance related derivative liability on the
                Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total derivative instruments for 2004
                were
                composed of an asset of $102.5 million recorded in derivative investments,
                a $12.5 million contra-liability recorded in insurance policy and
                claim
                reserves and a liability of $375.3 million recorded in reinsurance
                related
                derivative liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.


A
      reconciliation of the notional or contract amounts for the significant programs
      using derivative agreements and contracts is as follows:

Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had derivative instruments that were designated
      and qualified as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. We also had derivative
      instruments that were not designated as hedging instruments. See Note 1 for
      a
      detailed discussion of the accounting treatment for derivative instruments.
      For
      2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized net losses after-DAC and after-tax of $0.8
      million, $7.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively, in net income as a
      component of realized investment gains and losses. These losses relate to the
      ineffective portion of cash flow hedges, the change in market value for
      derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, and the loss
      on
      swap terminations. For 2005 and 2004, we recognized losses after-DAC and
      after-tax of $6.7 million and $8.1 million, respectively, in OCI related to
      the
      change in market value on derivative instruments that are designated and qualify
      as cash flow hedges.

Derivative
      Instruments Designated in Cash Flow Hedges

Interest
      Rate Swap Agreements.

We
      use
      interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to floating rate bond coupon
      payments, replicating a fixed rate bond. An interest rate swap is a contractual
      agreement to exchange payments at one or more times based on the actual or
      expected price level, performance or value of one or more underlying interest
      rates. We are required to pay the counterparty the stream of variable interest
      payments based on the coupon payments from the hedged bonds, and in turn,
      receive a fixed payment from the counterparty, at a predetermined interest
      rate.
      The net receipts/payments from these interest rate swaps are recorded in net
      investment income. Gains (losses) on interest rate swaps hedging our interest
      rate exposure on floating rate bond coupon payments are reclassified from
      accumulated OCI to net income as bond interest is accrued.

We
      also
      use interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to interest rate
      fluctuations related to the forecasted purchase of assets for certain investment
      portfolios. The gains (losses) resulting from the swap agreements are recorded
      in OCI. The gains (losses) are reclassified from accumulated OCI to earnings
      over the life of the assets once the assets are purchased. As of December 31,
      2005, there were no interest rate swaps hedging forecasted asset purchases.

Foreign
      Currency Swaps.

We
      use
      foreign currency swaps, which are traded over-the-counter, to hedge some of
      the
      foreign exchange risk of investments in fixed maturity securities denominated
      in
      foreign currencies. A foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to
      exchange the currencies of two different countries at a specified rate of
      exchange in the future. Gains (losses) on foreign currency swaps hedging foreign
      exchange risk exposure on foreign currency bond coupon payments are reclassified
      from accumulated OCI to net income as bond interest is accrued. The foreign
      currency swaps expire in 2006 through 2015.

Call
      Options on LNC Stock.

We
      use
      call options on our stock to hedge the expected increase in liabilities arising
      from SARs granted on our stock. Upon option expiration, the payment, if any,
      is
      the increase in our stock price over the strike


price
      of
      the option applied to the number of contracts. Call options hedging vested
      SARs
      are not eligible for hedge accounting and both are marked to market through
      net
      income. Call options hedging nonvested SARs are eligible for hedge accounting
      and are accounted for as cash flow hedges of the forecasted vesting of SAR
      liabilities. To the extent that the cash flow hedges are effective, changes
      in
      the fair value of the call options are recorded in accumulated OCI. Amounts
      recorded in OCI are reclassified to net income upon vesting of SARs. Our call
      option positions will be maintained until such time the SARs are either
      exercised or expire and our SAR liabilities are extinguished. The SARs expire
      five years from the date of grant.

Treasury
      Lock.

In 2005,
      we entered into a treasury lock to hedge the anticipated issuance of debt to
      finance the merger with Jefferson-Pilot. A treasury lock is an agreement that
      allows the holder to lock in a benchmark interest rate, so that if the benchmark
      interest rate increases, the holder is entitled to receive a payment from the
      counterparty to the agreement equal to the present value of the difference
      in
      the benchmark interest rate at the determination date and the locked-in
      benchmark interest rate. If the benchmark interest rate decreases, the holder
      must pay the counterparty to the agreement an amount equal to the present value
      of the difference in the benchmark interest rate at the determination date
      and
      the locked-in benchmark interest rate. The receipt (payment) from the
      termination of a treasury lock is recorded in OCI and is reclassified from
      accumulated OCI to interest expense over the coupon-paying period of the related
      senior debt. As of December 31, 2005, we had open treasury locks with notional
      amounts of $200 million.

Gains
      and
      losses on derivative contracts that qualify as cash-flow hedges are reclassified
      from accumulated OCI to current period earnings. As of December 31, 2005, $16.6
      million of the deferred net gains on derivative instruments accumulated in
      OCI
      are expected to be reclassified to earnings during 2006. This reclassification
      is primarily due to the receipt of interest payments associated with variable
      rate securities and forecasted purchases, payment of interest on our senior
      debt, the receipt of interest payments associated with foreign currency
      securities, and the periodic vesting of SARs.

Derivative
      Instruments Designated as Fair Value Hedges

Interest
      Rate Swap Agreements.

We
      use
      interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk of paying a higher fixed rate
      of
      interest on junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts and
      on
      senior debt than would be paid on long-term debt based on current interest
      rates
      in the marketplace. We are required to pay the counterparty a stream of variable
      interest payments based on the referenced index, and in turn, receives a fixed
      payment from the counterparty, at a predetermined interest rate. The net
      receipts/payments from these interest rate swaps are recorded as an adjustment
      to the interest expense related to the debt being hedged. The changes in fair
      value of the interest rate swap are reported in the Consolidated Statement
      of
      Income in the period of change along with the offsetting changes in fair value
      of the debt being hedged.

All
      Other Derivative Instruments

We
      use
      various other derivative instruments for risk management and income generation
      purposes that either do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or have
      not
      currently been qualified by us for hedge accounting treatment. The gain or
      loss
      related to the change in market value for these derivative instruments is
      recognized in net income during the period of the change (reported as realized
      gain (loss) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Income except
      where
      otherwise noted below).

Interest
      Rate and Equity Futures.

We
      use
      interest rate and equity futures contracts to hedge the liability exposure
      on
      certain options in variable annuity products. These futures contracts require
      payment between our counterparty and us on a daily basis for changes in the
      futures index price. Cash settlements on the change in market value of financial
      futures contracts along with the resulting gains and losses are recorded daily
      in net income through the benefits line in the Consolidated Statements of
      Income. The open positions at December 31, 2005 all expire in 2006.

Total
      Return Swaps.

We
      use
      total return swaps to hedge a portion of the liability related to our deferred
      compensation plans. We receive the total return on a portfolio of indexes and
      pay a floating rate of interest. Cash settlements on the change in market value
      of the total return swaps along with the resulting gains and losses are recorded
      in net income through the underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other
      expenses line in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The open positions
      at
      December 31, 2005 do not have a stated contract expiration date.

Foreign
      Currency Forward Contract.

We used
      foreign currency forward contracts to hedge dividends received from its
      foreign subsidiary, Lincoln UK.  The foreign currency forward contracts
      obligate us to deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date at a
      specified exchange rate. The contract

does
      not
      qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133.  Therefore, all gains or
      losses on the foreign currency forward contracts are recorded as realized
      gains (losses).


Put
      Options.

We
      use
      put options to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable
      annuity products. Put options are contracts that require counterparties to
      pay
      us at a specified future date the amount, if any, by which a specified equity
      index is less than the strike rate stated in the agreement, applied to a
      notional amount. Cash settlements on the change in market value of the put
      options along with the resulting gains and losses are recorded in net income
      through the benefits line in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The open
      positions at December 31, 2005 expire in 2009 through 2020.

Interest
      Rate Swap Agreements.

We
      used a
      forward starting interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to the
      forecasted sale of mortgage loans. We were required to pay the counterparty
      a
      predetermined fixed stream of payments, and in return, received payments based
      on a floating rate from the counterparty. The net receipts/payments from these
      interest rate swaps were recorded in realized gain (loss) on investments and
      derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2005, there were no forward starting
      interest rate swap agreements.

Interest
      Rate Cap Agreements.

The
      interest rate cap agreements, which expire in 2006 through 2010, entitle us
      to
      receive quarterly payments from the counterparties on specified future reset
      dates, contingent on future interest rates. For each cap, the amount of such
      quarterly payments, if any, is determined by the excess of a market interest
      rate over a specified cap rate multiplied by the notional amount divided by
      four. The purpose of our interest rate cap agreement program is to provide
      a
      level of protection for our annuity line of business from the effect of rising
      interest rates. The interest rate cap agreements provide an economic hedge
      of
      the annuity line of business. However, the interest rate cap agreements are
      not
      linked to assets and liabilities on the balance sheet that meet the
      significantly increased level of specificity required under SFAS 133. Therefore,
      the interest rate cap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under
      SFAS
      133.

Swaptions.

Swaptions entitled us to receive settlement payments from the counterparties
      on
      specified expiration dates, contingent on future interest rates. For each
      swaption, the amount of such settlement payments, if any, is determined by
      the
      present value of the difference between the fixed rate on a market rate swap
      and
      the strike rate multiplied by the notional amount. The purpose of our swaption
      program was to provide a level of protection for our annuity line of business
      from the effect of rising interest rates. The swaptions provided an economic
      hedge of the annuity line of business. However, the swaptions were not linked
      to
      specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet that met the significantly
      increased level of specificity required under SFAS 133. Therefore, the swaptions
      did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. At December 31, 2005,
      there
      were no outstanding swaptions.

Credit
      Default Swaps.

We
      buy
      credit default swaps to hedge against a drop in bond prices due to credit
      concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit swap allows us to put the bond back
      to the counterparty at par upon a credit event by the bond issuer. A credit
      event is defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or obligation acceleration.
      We
      have not currently qualified credit default swaps for hedge accounting under
      SFAS 133, as amounts are insignificant. As of December 31, 2005, we had no
      outstanding purchased credit default swaps.

We
      also
      sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors. The credit
      default swaps hedge the investor against a drop in bond prices due to credit
      concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit swap allows the investor to put
      the
      bond back to us at par upon a credit event by the bond issuer. A credit event
      is
      defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or restructuring. As of December 31,
      2005, we had credit swaps with a notional amount of $20.0 million, which expire
      in 2010.

Call
      Options on Our Stock.

As
      discussed previously in the Cash Flow Hedges section, we use call options on
      our
      stock to hedge the expected increase in liabilities arising from SARs granted
      on
      our stock. Call options hedging vested SARs are not eligible for hedge
      accounting treatment under SFAS 133. Mark-to-market changes are recorded in
      net
      income in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses.

Derivative
      Instrument Embedded in Deferred Compensation Plan.

We
      have
      certain deferred compensation plans that have embedded derivative instruments.
      The liability related to these plans varies based on the investment options
      selected by the participants. The liability related to certain investment
      options selected by the participants is marked to market through net income
      in
      underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses.

Derivative
      Instrument Embedded in Modified Coinsurance and Coinsurance with Funds Withheld
      Arrangements.

We
      are
      involved in various Modco and CFW reinsurance arrangements that have embedded
      derivatives. The change in fair value of the embedded derivative, as well as
      the
      gains or losses on trading securities supporting these arrangements, flows
      through net income.

Derivative
      Instrument Embedded in Variable Annuity Products.

We
      have
      certain variable annuity products with a GMWB feature that is an embedded
      derivative. The change in fair value of the embedded derivatives flows through
      net income through the benefits line in the Consolidated Statements of Income.


Derivative
      Instruments Embedded in Available-for-Sale Securities.

We
      own
      various debt securities that (a) contain call options to exchange the debt
      security for other specified securities of the borrower, usually common stock,
      or (b) contain call options to receive the return on equity-like indexes. The
      change in fair value of the embedded derivatives flows through net income.
      These
      embedded derivatives have not been qualified for hedge accounting treatment
      under SFAS 133.

We
      have
      used certain other derivative instruments in the past for hedging purposes.
      Although other derivative instruments may have been used in the past, derivative
      types that were not outstanding from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005
      are not discussed in this disclosure.

Additional
      Derivative Information.

Income
      other than realized gains and losses for the agreements and contracts described
      above amounted to $28.4 million, $26.8 million and $32.7 million in 2005, 2004
      and 2003, respectively. The increase in income for 2005 resulted from a
      reduction in expenses on futures offset by reductions in income on interest
      rate
      swaps, total return swaps and puts.

We
      are
      exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on
      various derivative contracts. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance
      by
      any of the counterparties. The credit risk associated with such agreements
      is
      minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with
      long-standing, superior performance records. The amount of such exposure is
      essentially the net replacement cost or market value less collateral held for
      such agreements with each counterparty if the net market value is in our favor.
      At December 31, 2005, the exposure was $160.0 million.

10. 
      Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The
      following discussion outlines the methodologies and assumptions used to
      determine the estimated fair value of our financial instruments. Considerable
      judgment is required to develop these fair values. Accordingly, the estimates
      shown are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized
      in a
      one-time, current market exchange of all of our financial instruments.

Fixed
      Maturity and Equity Securities—Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities.

Fair
      values for fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices, where
      available. For fixed maturity securities not actively traded, fair values are
      estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services. In the case
      of private placements, fair values are estimated by discounting expected future
      cash flows using a current market rate applicable to the coupon rate, credit
      quality and maturity of the investments. The fair values for equity securities
      are based on quoted market prices.

Mortgage
      Loans on Real Estate.

The
      estimated fair value of mortgage loans on real estate was established using
      a
      discounted cash flow method based on credit rating, maturity and future income.
      The ratings for mortgages in good standing are based on property type, location,
      market conditions, occupancy, debt service coverage, loan to value, caliber
      of
      tenancy, borrower and payment record. Fair values for impaired mortgage loans
      are based on: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
      at
      the loan’s effective interest rate; 2) the loan’s market price; or 3) the fair
      value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

Policy
      Loans.

The
      estimated fair value of investments in policy loans was calculated on a
      composite discounted cash flow basis using Treasury interest rates consistent
      with the maturity durations assumed. These durations were based on historical
      experience.

Derivative
      Instruments.

We
      employ several different methods for determining the fair value of our
      derivative instruments. Fair values for derivative contracts are based on
      current settlement values. These values are based on: 1) quoted market prices;
      2) industry standard models that are commercially available; and 3) broker
      quotes. These techniques project cash flows of the derivatives using current
      and
      implied future market conditions. We calculate the present value of the cash
      flows to determine the derivatives’ current fair market value.

Other
      Investments, and Cash and Invested Cash.

The
      carrying value for assets classified as other investments, and cash and invested
      cash in the accompanying balance sheets approximates their fair value. Other
      investments include limited partnership investments which are accounted for
      using the equity method of accounting.


Investment
      Type Insurance Contracts.

The
      balance sheet captions, “Insurance Policy and Claims Reserves” and
“Contractholder Funds,” include investment type insurance contracts (i.e.,
      deposit contracts and certain guaranteed interest contracts). The fair values
      for the deposit contracts and certain guaranteed interest contracts are based
      on
      their approximate surrender values. The fair values for the remaining guaranteed
      interest and similar contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow
      calculations. These calculations are based on interest rates currently offered
      on similar contracts with maturities that are consistent with those remaining
      for the contracts being valued.

The
      remainder of the balance sheet captions, “Insurance Policy and Claims Reserves”
and “Contractholder Funds” that do not fit the definition of “investment type
      insurance contracts” are considered insurance contracts. Fair value disclosures
      are not required for these insurance contracts, nor have we determined the
      fair
      value of such contracts. It is our position that not disclosing the fair value
      of these insurance contracts is important because readers of these financial
      statements could draw inappropriate conclusions about our shareholders’ equity
      determined on a fair value basis. It could be misleading if only the fair value
      of assets and liabilities defined as financial instruments are disclosed. Along
      with other companies in the insurance industry, we are monitoring the related
      actions of the various rule-making bodies and attempting to determine an
      appropriate methodology for estimating and disclosing the “fair value” of their
      insurance contract liabilities.

Short-term
      and Long-term Debt.

Fair
      values for our long-term debt issues are based on quoted market prices or
      estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on our incremental borrowing
      rate at the balance sheet date for similar types of borrowing arrangements
      where
      quoted prices are not available. For short-term debt, excluding current
      maturities of long-term debt, the carrying value approximates fair value.

Junior
      Subordinated Debentures Issued to Affiliated Trusts.

Fair
      values for junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts are based
      on quoted market prices.

Guarantees.

Our
      guarantees relate to mortgage loan pass-through certificates. Based on
      historical performance where repurchases have been negligible and the current
      status of the debt, none of the loans are delinquent and the fair value
      liability for the guarantees related to mortgage loan pass-through certificates
      is insignificant.

Investment
      Commitments.

Fair
      values for commitments to make investments in fixed maturity securities
      (primarily private placements), mortgage loans on real estate and real estate
      are based on the difference between the value of the committed investments
      as of
      the date of the accompanying balance sheets and the commitment date. These
      estimates take into account changes in interest rates, the counterparties’
credit standing and the remaining terms of the commitments.

Separate
      Accounts.

We
      report
      assets held in separate accounts at fair value. The related liabilities are
      also
      reported at fair value in amounts equal to the separate account assets.


The
      carrying values and estimated fair values of our financial instruments are
      as
      follows:

*

Total
                derivative instruments for 2005 are composed of an asset of $174.7
                million
                recorded in derivative investments, a $5.9 million liability recorded
                in
                insurance policy and claim reserves and a liability of $292.2 million
                recorded in reinsurance related derivative liability. Total derivative
                instruments for 2004 are composed of an asset of $102.5 million recorded
                in derivative investments, a $12.5 million contra-liability recorded
                in
                insurance policy and claim reserves and a liability of $375.3 million
                recorded in the reinsurance related derivative liability.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of the deposit contracts and
      certain guaranteed contracts is net of DAC of $383.2 million and $434.4 million,
      respectively, excluding adjustments for DAC applicable to changes in the fair
      value of securities. The carrying values of these contracts are stated net
      of
      DAC so that they are comparable with the fair value basis.

      Segment Information

We
      have
      four business segments: Lincoln Retirement, Life Insurance, Investment
      Management and Lincoln UK.

Our
      Lincoln Retirement segment, with principal operations in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
      provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for
      its clients through the manufacture and sale of fixed and variable annuities.
      Through a broad-based distribution network, Lincoln Retirement provides an
      array
      of annuity products to individuals and employer-sponsored groups in all 50
      states of the United States. Lincoln Retirement distributes some of its products
      through LFD, as well as LFA, our retail unit. In addition, Lincoln Retirement
      has alliances with a variety of unrelated companies where we provide the
      manufacturing platform for annuity products and the alliance company provides
      investment management, marketing and distribution.

Our
      Life
      Insurance segment, with principal operations in Hartford, Connecticut, and
      additional offices in Fort Wayne, Indiana and Schaumberg, Illinois, focuses
      on
      the creation and protection of wealth for its clients through the manufacture
      and sale of life insurance products throughout the United States. The Life
      Insurance segment offers universal life, variable universal life,
      interest-sensitive whole life, corporate owned life insurance, linked-benefit
      life (a universal life product with a long-term care benefit) and term life
      insurance. The Life Insurance segment’s products are primarily distributed
      through LFD and LFA.

Our
      Investment Management segment, with principal operations in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania, offers a variety of asset management services to retail and
      institutional clients throughout the United States and certain foreign
      countries. Its product offerings include mutual funds and managed accounts.
      It
      also provides investment management and account administration services for
      variable annuity products, 401(k), “529” college savings plans, pension,
      endowment, trust, and other institutional accounts. Retail products are
      primarily marketed by LFD through financial intermediaries including LFA.
      Institutional and asset management products are marketed by a separate sales
      force within Delaware, which works closely with pension consultants. Delaware
      also provides investment management services for our general account assets.

Our
      Lincoln UK segment, with principal operations in Barnwood, Gloucester, England,
      is licensed to do business throughout the United Kingdom. Lincoln UK manages,
      administers and accepts new deposits on its current block of business and
      accepts new business for certain products. Lincoln UK’s product portfolio
      principally consists of unit-linked life and pension products, which are similar
      to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products.

We
      report
      the operations of LFA and LFD and the operations not directly related to the
      business segments and unallocated corporate items (i.e., corporate investment
      income, interest expense on corporate debt, unallocated overhead expenses,
      and
      the amortization of the gain on the sale of reinsurance business) in Other
      Operations. The gain resulting from the 2001 indemnity reinsurance transaction
      with Swiss Re for acquisition of our reinsurance business was deferred and
      is
      amortized into earnings at the rate that earnings on the reinsured business
      are
      expected to emerge, over a period of 15 years. The ongoing management of the
      indemnity reinsurance contracts and the reporting of the deferred gain are
      reported in Other Operations.


Financial
      data by segment was as follows:


Most
      of
      our foreign operations are conducted by Lincoln UK. The data for this company
      is
      shown above under the Lincoln UK segment heading. The other segments have
      limited non-U.S. operations. Foreign intracompany revenues are not significant.
      Financial data for Lincoln UK and the other non-U.S. units is as follows:

12.
      Shareholders’ Equity

Our
      common and series A preferred stocks are without par value.

All
      of
      the issued and outstanding series A preferred stock is $3 cumulative convertible
      and is convertible at any time into shares of common stock. The conversion
      rate
      is sixteen shares of common stock for each share of series A preferred stock,
      subject to adjustment for certain events. The series A preferred stock is
      redeemable at our option at $80 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
      Outstanding series A preferred stock has full voting rights, subject to
      adjustment if we are in default as to the payment of dividends. If LNC is
      liquidated or dissolved, holders of series A preferred stock will be entitled
      to
      payments of $80 per share. The difference between the aggregate preference
      on
      liquidation value and the financial statement balance for the series A preferred
      stock was $0.7 million at December 31, 2005.

We
      have
      outstanding one common share purchase (“Right”) on each outstanding share of LNC
      common stock. A Right will also be issued with each share of LNC common stock
      that is issued before the Rights become exercisable or expire. If a person
      or
      group announces an offer that would result in beneficial ownership of 15% or
      more of LNC common stock, the Rights will become exercisable and each Right
      will
      entitle its holder to purchase one share of LNC common stock for $100. Upon
      the
      acquisition of 15% or more of LNC common stock, each holder of a Right (other
      than the person acquiring the 15% or more) will have the right to acquire the
      number of shares of LNC common stock that have a market value of two times
      the
      exercise price of the Right. If we are acquired in a business combination
      transaction in which we do not survive, each holder of a Right (other than
      the
      acquiring person) will have the right to acquire common stock of the acquiring
      person having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
      We
      can redeem each Right for one cent at any time prior to the tenth day after
      a
      person or group has acquired 15% or more of LNC common stock. The Rights expire
      on November 14, 2006. As of December 31, 2005, there were 173,768,078 Rights
      outstanding.

During
      2005 and 2004, we purchased and retired 2.3 million and 7.6 million shares,
      respectively, of our common stock at a total cost of $103.6 million and $350.2
      million, respectively. There were no repurchases in 2003. The common stock
      account was reduced for these purchases in proportion to the percentage of
      shares acquired. The remainder of the purchase price was charged to retained
      earnings.

The
      income used in the calculation of our diluted earnings per share is our income
      before cumulative effect of accounting change and net income, reduced by
      minority interest adjustments related to outstanding stock options under the
      DIUS stock option incentive plan of $0.3 million and $0.4 million for 2005
      and
      2004, respectively.


A
      reconciliation of the denominator in the calculations of basic and diluted
      net
      income and income before cumulative effect of accounting change per share is
      as
      follows:

We
      have
      stock options outstanding, which were issued at prices that are above the
      current average market price of LNC common stock. In the event the average
      market price of LNC common stock exceeds the issue price of stock options,
      such
      options would be dilutive to our earnings per share and will be shown in the
      table above. Participants in our deferred compensation plans that select LNC
      stock for measuring the investment return attributable to their deferral amounts
      will be paid out in LNC stock. The obligation to satisfy these deferred
      compensation plan liabilities is dilutive and is shown in the table above.

Details
      underlying the balance sheet caption “Net Unrealized Gain on Securities
      Available-for-Sale,” are as follows:

Adjustments
          to DAC and amounts required to satisfy policyholder commitments are netted
          against the DAC asset line and included within the Insurance Policy and
          Claim
          Reserves line on the balance sheet, respectively.

Details
          underlying the change in “Net Unrealized Gain on Securities Available-for-Sale,
          Net of Reclassification Adjustment” shown on the Consolidated Statements of
          Shareholders’ Equity are as follows:

(1)

The
                reclassification adjustment for gains (losses) does not include the
                impact
                of associated adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and amounts
                required to satisfy policyholder commitments.


The
“Net
      Unrealized Gain on Derivative Instruments” component of other comprehensive
      income is net of Federal income tax expense (benefit) of $(4.6) million, $2.9
      million and $(3.9) million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and net of
      adjustments to DAC of $(7.3) million, $(7.9) million and $(4.5) million for
      2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We reclassified into net income from other
      comprehensive income $9.6 million, $22.7 million and $11.6 million for 2005,
      2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
      “Foreign Currency Translation” component of other comprehensive income is net of
      Federal income tax expense (benefit) of $(38.2) million, $24.4 million and
      $31.3
      million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

13.
      Acquisitions and Divestitures

Sale
      of Delaware London-based International Investment Unit

In
      September 2004, we sold DIAL to the unit’s management group and an unaffiliated
      investor. We received $180.9 million in cash, of which $141.5 million was paid
      as a dividend to the holding company, and relief of certain obligations of
      approximately $19.0 million. Our after-tax gain from the transaction was $46.1
      million. We used the funds for general corporate purposes, including debt
      repayment and share repurchases. The Investment Management segment’s results for
      2004 included approximately $12.4 million of income from operations related
      to
      DIAL. The sale resulted in a reduction of $22.1 billion in the Investment
      Management segment’s assets under management at the time of the sale. As of
      December 31, 2005, approximately $16.4 billion of the Investment Management
      segment’s remaining assets under management are being sub-advised on our behalf
      Mondrian, the acquirer. Assets under management sub-advised by Mondrian include
      retail and institutional mutual funds, managed accounts, Delaware Pooled Trust
      funds, variable annuity funds and institutional advisory accounts of
      approximately $2.4 billion, $8.8 billion, $3.8 billion, $1.0 billion, and $0.4
      billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2005.

14.
      Restructuring Charges

All
      restructuring charges are included in underwriting, acquisition, insurance
      and
      other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the year incurred.

      Restructuring Plan

During
      May 2005, LFA implemented a restructuring plan to realign its field management
      and financial planning support areas. Total pre-tax restructuring charges
      incurred during 2005 were $6.9 million. These charges, which are included in
      Other Operations, included employee severance and termination benefits of $4.1
      million and rent on abandoned office space of $2.8 million. The remaining
      reserves totaled $2.7 million at December 31, 2005. The plan is expected to
      be
      completed by the third quarter of 2006, except for lease payments on vacated
      space which run through 2008.

      Restructuring Plan

In
      January 2003, the Life Insurance segment announced that it was realigning its
      operations in Hartford, Connecticut and Schaumburg, Illinois to enhance
      productivity, efficiency and scalability while positioning the segment for
      future growth. In February 2003, Lincoln Retirement announced plans to
      consolidate its fixed annuity operations in Schaumburg, Illinois into Fort
      Wayne, Indiana. In June 2003, we announced that we were combining our retirement
      and life insurance businesses into a single operating unit focused on providing
      wealth accumulation and protection, income distribution and wealth transfer
      products. In August 2003, we announced additional realignment activities, which
      impacted all of our domestic operations.


The
      following table provides information about the 2003
      restructuring plans.

Pre-tax
      restructuring charges for the June/August realignment activities for 2005 by
      segment were as follows: Retirement ($17.4 million), Life Insurance ($3.3
      million), and Other Operations ($0.7 million).

Pre-tax
      restructuring charges for the June/August realignment activities for 2004 were
      as follows: Retirement ($6.2 million), Life Insurance ($0.6 million), Investment
      Management ($1.6 million), and Other Operations ($9.9 million).

Pre-tax
      restructuring charges for the June/August realignment activities for 2003 were
      as follows: Retirement ($15.9 million), Life Insurance ($1.7 million),
      Investment Management ($7.1 million), and Other Operations ($7.2 million).

      and 2000 Restructuring Plans

During
      1999 and 2000, we implemented restructuring plans relating to the Lincoln UK’s
      operations. In addition to various other activities, these plans involved
      vacating leased facilities. All other plan activities have been completed and
      the remaining reserves relate to future lease payments on exited properties,
      which run through 2016. The remaining reserves for these plans totaled $6.3
      million at December 31, 2005.

Controls and Procedures

(a)

Conclusions
      Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We
      maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that
      information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under
      the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded,
      processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
      Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information
      is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief
      Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
      decisions regarding required disclosure. As of December 31, 2005, we, under
      the
      supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
      Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
      disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange
      Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
      Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective
      in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our
      consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
      under
      the Exchange Act.

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included on page

of “Item
      8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and is incorporated herein by
      reference.

A
      control
      system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
      assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of
      the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
      can
      provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not
      occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
      company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may
      become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the
      degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

(c)

Changes
      in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During
      the fourth quarter of 2005, we implemented certain changes in internal controls
      in connection with a procurement outsourcing project. The implementation
      required changes in certain financial processes, software and personnel. Based
      on our review of key controls involved in these processes, we determined that
      these changes have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
      affect our internal control over financial reporting. These changes were related
      to a process improvement initiative and were not in response to an identified
      deficiency in internal controls over financial reporting.
