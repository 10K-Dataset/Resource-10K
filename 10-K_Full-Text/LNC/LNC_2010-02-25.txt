Business

OVERVIEW

Lincoln
National Corporation (“LNC,” which also may be referred to as “Lincoln,” “we,”
“our” or “us”) is a holding company, which operates multiple insurance and
retirement businesses through subsidiary companies.  Through our
business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and
retirement income products and solutions.  These products include
fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance
(“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life
insurance, mutual funds and group life insurance.  LNC was organized
under the laws of the state of Indiana in 1968.  We currently maintain
our principal executive offices in Radnor, Pennsylvania. “Lincoln Financial
Group” is the marketing name for LNC and its subsidiary companies. As of
December 31, 2009, LNC had consolidated assets of $177.4 billion and
consolidated stockholders’ equity of $11.7 billion.

We
provide products and services in two operating businesses and report results
through four segments as follows:

Business

      Segments

Retirement
      Solutions

Annuities

Defined
      Contribution

Insurance
      Solutions

Life
      Insurance

Group
      Protection

We also
have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are
not directly related to the business segments, unallocated corporate items and
the ongoing amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity reinsurance portion
of the sale of our former reinsurance segment to Swiss Re Life & Health
America Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in the fourth quarter of 2001.  Unallocated
corporate items include investment income on investments related to the amount
of statutory surplus in our insurance subsidiaries that is not allocated to our
business units and other corporate investments, interest expense on short-term
and long-term borrowings and certain expenses, including restructuring and
merger-related expenses.  Other Operations also includes our run-off
institutional pension business, the results of certain disability income
business due to the rescission of a reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re and the
results of our remaining media businesses.

As a
result of entering agreements of sale for Lincoln National (UK) plc (“Lincoln
UK”) and Delaware Management Holdings, Inc. (“Delaware”) during 2009, we have
reported the results of these businesses as discontinued operations on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and the assets and liabilities as held
for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods
presented.  For further information, see “Acquisitions and
Dispositions” below.

The
results of Lincoln Financial Network (“LFN”) and Lincoln Financial Distributors
(“LFD”), our retail and wholesale distributors, respectively, are included in
the segments for which they distribute products.  LFD distributes our
individual products and services, defined contribution (“DC”) plans and
corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”) products
and services.  The distribution occurs primarily through consultants,
brokers, planners, agents, financial advisors, third party administrators
(“TPAs”) and other intermediaries.  Insurance Solutions – Group
Protection distributes its products and services primarily through employee
benefit brokers, TPAs and other employee benefit firms.  As of
December 31, 2009, LFD had approximately 600 internal and external wholesalers
(including sales managers).  As of December 31, 2009, LFN offered LNC
and non-proprietary products and advisory services through a national network of
approximately 7,700 active producers who placed business with us within the last
twelve months.


Financial
information in the tables that follow is presented in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless
otherwise indicated.  We provide revenues, income (loss) from
operations and assets attributable to each of our business segments and Other
Operations, as well as revenues derived inside and outside the U.S. for the last
three fiscal years, in Note 23.

Revenues
by segment (in millions) were as follows:

Acquisitions
and Dispositions

On
January 4, 2010, LNC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Lincoln National
Investment Companies, completed the sale of the outstanding capital stock of
Delaware, our former subsidiary, to Macquarie Bank Limited, pursuant to a
Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of August 18, 2009.  Delaware
provided investment products and services to individuals and
institutions.  We currently expect to receive cash consideration at
closing of approximately $405 million, after-tax.  The closing
purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments, including an adjustment
based on the final closing balance sheet as determined under the Purchase and
Sale Agreement.

In
addition, certain of our subsidiaries, including The Lincoln National Life
Insurance Company (“LNL”), our primary insurance subsidiary, have entered into
investment advisory agreements with Delaware dated January 4, 2010, pursuant to
which Delaware will continue to manage the majority of the general account
insurance assets of the subsidiaries.  The investment advisory
agreements will have 10-year terms, and we may terminate them without cause,
subject to a purchase price adjustment of up to $84 million in the event that
all of the agreements with our subsidiaries are terminated.  The
amount of the potential adjustment will decline on a pro rata basis over the
10-year term of the advisory agreements.

On
October 1, 2009, we completed the sale of the capital stock of Lincoln UK to SLF
of Canada UK Limited for proceeds of $307 million, after-tax, subject to
customary post-closing adjustments.  We retained Lincoln UK’s pension
plan assets and liabilities. The former Lincoln UK segment primarily focused on
providing life and retirement income products in the United
Kingdom.

On
January 8, 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision approved our application to
become a savings and loan holding company and our acquisition of Newton County
Loan & Savings, FSB (“NCLS”), a federally regulated savings bank located in
Indiana.  We contributed $10 million to the capital of
NCLS.  We closed on our purchase of NCLS on January 15,
2009.


On
November 12, 2007, Lincoln Financial Media Company (“LFMC”), our wholly-owned
subsidiary, entered into two stock purchase agreements with Raycom Holdings, LLC
(“Raycom”).  Pursuant to one of the agreements, LFMC agreed to sell to
Raycom all of the outstanding capital stock of three of LFMC’s wholly-owned
subsidiaries:  WBTV, Inc., the owner and operator of television
station WBTV, Charlotte, North Carolina; WCSC, Inc., the owner and operator of
television station WCSC, Charleston, South Carolina; and WWBT, Inc., the owner
and operator of television station WWBT, Richmond, Virginia.  The
transaction closed on March 31, 2008, and LFMC received proceeds of $546
million.  Pursuant to the other agreement, LFMC agreed to sell to
Raycom all of the outstanding capital stock of Lincoln Financial Sports, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of LFMC.  This transaction closed on November
30, 2007, and LFMC received $42 million of proceeds.

On
November 12, 2007, LFMC also entered into a stock purchase agreement with
Greater Media, Inc., to sell all of the outstanding capital stock of LFMC of
North Carolina, the owner and operator of radio stations WBT(AM), Charlotte,
North Carolina; WBT-FM, Chester, South Carolina; and WLNK(FM), Charlotte, North
Carolina.  This transaction closed on January 31, 2008, and LFMC
received proceeds of $100 million.  More information on these LFMC
transactions can be found in our Form 8-K filed on November 14, 2007, and in
Note 3.

On April
3, 2006, we completed our merger with Jefferson-Pilot Corporation
(“Jefferson-Pilot”), pursuant to which Jefferson-Pilot merged into one of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Prior to the merger, Jefferson-Pilot,
through its subsidiaries, offered full lines of individual life, annuity and
investment products, and group life insurance products, disability income and
dental contracts, and it operated television and radio stations and a sports
broadcasting network.

BUSINESS
SEGMENTS AND OTHER OPERATIONS

RETIREMENT
SOLUTIONS

Overview

The
Retirement Solutions business, with principal operations in Radnor,
Pennsylvania; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Hartford, Connecticut; and Greensboro, North
Carolina and additional operations in Concord, New Hampshire and Arlington
Heights, Illinois, provides its products through two
segments:  Annuities and Defined Contribution.  The
Annuities segment provides tax-deferred growth and lifetime income opportunities
for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed
annuities, and variable annuities.  The Defined Contribution segment
provides employer-sponsored fixed and variable annuities and mutual fund-based
programs in the 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plan marketplaces.  Products
for both segments are distributed through a wide range of intermediaries
including both affiliated and unaffiliated channels including advisors,
consultants, brokers, banks and wirehouses.

Retirement
Solutions – Annuities

Overview

The
Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment provides tax-deferred growth and
lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering fixed and variable
annuities.  The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment offers
non-qualified and qualified fixed and variable annuities to
individuals.  The “fixed” and “variable” classification describes
whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the assets
supporting the contract.  This also determines the manner in which we
earn investment margin profits from these products, either as investment spreads
for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable
products.

Annuities
have several features that are attractive to customers.  First, they
provide tax-deferred growth in the underlying principal, thereby deferring the
tax consequences of the growth in value until withdrawals are made from the
accumulation values, often at lower tax rates occurring during
retirement.  Second, annuities are unique in that contract holders can
select a variety of payout alternatives to help provide an income flow for
life.  Many annuity contracts include guarantee features (living and
death benefits) that are not found in any other investment vehicle and, we
believe, make annuities attractive especially in times of economic
uncertainty.  Over the last several years, the individual annuities
market has seen an increase in competition with respect to guarantee
features.


Products

In
general, an annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual
or group in which the insurance company, after receipt of one or more premium
payments, agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on a
periodic basis (i.e., annually, semi-annually, quarterly or monthly), beginning
on a certain date and continuing for a period of time as specified in the
contract.  Periodic payments can begin within twelve months after the
premium is received (referred to as an immediate annuity) or at a future date in
time (referred to as a deferred annuity).  This retirement vehicle
helps protect an individual from outliving his or her money and can be either a
fixed annuity or a variable annuity.

The
Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment’s deposits (in millions) were as

Variable
Annuities

A
variable annuity provides the contract holder the ability to direct the
investment of premium deposits into one or more sub-accounts offered through the
product (“variable portion”) or into a fixed account with a guaranteed return
(“fixed portion”).  The value of the variable portion of the contract
holder’s account varies with the performance of the underlying sub-accounts
chosen by the contract holder.  The underlying assets of the
sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance series of mutual
funds.  The contract holder’s return is tied to the performance of the
segregated assets underlying the variable annuity (i.e. the contract holder
bears the investment risk associated with these investments).  The
value of the fixed portion is guaranteed by us and recorded in our general
account liabilities.  Variable annuity account values were $59.4
billion, $44.5 billion and $62.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively, including the fixed portion of variable accounts of
$4.0 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion, for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We charge
mortality and expense assessments and administrative fees on variable annuity
accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses.  These
assessments are built into accumulation unit values, which when multiplied by
the number of units owned for any sub-account equals the contract holder’s
account value for that sub-account.  The fees that we earn from these
contracts are reported as insurance fees on our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss).  In addition, for some contracts, we collect surrender
charges that range from 0% to 10% of withdrawals when contract holders surrender
their contracts during the surrender charge period, which is generally higher
during the early years of a contract.  Our individual variable annuity
products have a maximum surrender charge period of ten years.

We offer
A-share, B-share, C-share, L-share and bonus variable annuities, although not
with every annuity product.  The differences in these relate to the
sales charge and fee structure associated with the contract.

·

An
      A-share has a front-end sales charge and no back-end contingent deferred
      sales charge, also known as a surrender charge.  The net premium
      (premium less front-end charge) is invested in the contract, resulting in
      full liquidity and lower mortality and expense assessments over the long
      term than those in other share classes.

·

A
      B-share has a seven-year surrender charge that is only paid if the account
      is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free
      withdrawals within the contract’s specified surrender charge
      period.  The entire premium is invested in the contract, but it
      offers limited liquidity during the surrender charge
    period.

·

A
      C-share has no front-end sales charge or back-end surrender
      charge.  Accordingly, it offers maximum liquidity but mortality
      and expense assessments are higher than those for A-share or B-share
      during the surrender charge period.  A persistency credit is
      applied beginning in year eight so that the total charge to the customer
      is consistent with B-share
levels.


·

An
      L-share has a four to five year surrender charge that is only paid if the
      account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free
      withdrawals within the contract’s specified surrender charge
      period.  The differences between the L-share and the B-share are
      the length of the surrender charge period and the fee
      structure.  L-shares have a shorter surrender charge period, so
      for the added liquidity, mortality and expense assessments are
      higher.  We offer L-share annuity products with persistency
      credits that are applied in all years after surrender charges are no
      longer applicable so that the total charge to the customer is consistent
      with B-share levels.

·

A
      bonus annuity is a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus credit to
      a contract based on a specified percentage (typically ranging from 2% to
      5%) of each deposit.  The entire premium plus the bonus are
      invested in the sub-accounts supporting the contract.  It has a
      seven to nine-year surrender charge.  The expenses are slightly
      more than those for a B-share.  We offer bonus annuity products
      with persistency credits that are applied in all years after surrender
      charges are no longer applicable so that the total charge to the customer
      is consistent with B-share levels.

We offer
guaranteed benefit riders with certain of our variable annuity products, such as
a guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”), a guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”), a
guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) and a combination of such
benefits.  Most of our variable annuity products also offer the choice
of a fixed option that provides for guaranteed interest credited to the account
value.

We design
and actively manage the features and structure of our guaranteed benefit riders
to maintain a competitive suite of products consistent with profitability and
risk management goals.  In late 2008 and early 2009, in light of
changes in the variable annuity marketplace driven by financial market
conditions, we made changes to our riders to reduce our exposure to equity
market volatility and interest rate movements while compensating us for
increasing costs to provide the benefits.  The changes include, but
are not limited to, implementing investment restrictions for all new rider sales
and for the majority of in-force policies with guaranteed riders, raising the
charge for guaranteed benefit riders, reducing roll-up periods and eliminating
certain features.

Approximately

%

, 91% and 91% of
variable annuity separate account values had a GDB rider as of December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The GDB features currently offered
include those where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder that upon
death, we will return no less than:  the total deposits made to the
contract, adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals; the total deposits made
to the contract, adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals, plus a minimum
return; or the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted
to reflect any partial withdrawals following the contract
anniversary.

Approximately
23%, 26% and 28% of variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively, had a

Lincoln SmartSecurity

®
Advantage rider.  The

Lincoln SmartSecurity

®
Advantage one-year benefit is a GWB rider that offers the contract holder a
guarantee equal to the initial deposit (or contract value, if elected after
issue), adjusted for any subsequent purchase payments or
withdrawals.

Lincoln SmartSecurity

®
Advantage one-year allows an owner to step up the guarantee amount automatically
on the benefit anniversary to the current contract value if the contract value
is greater than the guarantee amount at the time of step up.  To
receive the full amount of the guarantee, annual withdrawals are limited to 5%
of the guaranteed amount.  Withdrawals will continue until the longer
of when the guarantee is equal to zero or for the rest of the owner’s life
(“single life version”) or the life of the owner or owner’s spouse (“joint life
version”) as long as withdrawals begin after attained age 65 and are limited to
5% of the guaranteed amount.  Withdrawals in excess of the applicable
maximum in any contract year are assessed any applicable surrender charges, and
the guaranteed amount is recalculated.

We offer
other product riders including

i4LIFE

® Advantage and
4LATER

®

Advantage

.

The

i4LIFE

® rider, on which we
have received a U.S. patent, allows variable annuity contract holders access and
control during the income distribution phase of their contract.  This
added flexibility allows the contract holder to access the account value for
transfers, additional withdrawals and other service features like portfolio
rebalancing.  Approximately 11%, 11% and 9% of variable annuity
account values as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, have
elected an

i4LIFE

®
Advantage feature.  In general, GIB is an optional feature available
with

i4LIFE

® Advantage
that guarantees regular income payments will not fall below 75% of the highest
income payment on a specified anniversary date (reduced for any subsequent
withdrawals).  Approximately 94%, 92% and 88% of

i4LIFE

® Advantage account
values elected the GIB feature as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  4LATER

®

Advantage provides a
minimum income base used to determine the GIB floor when a client begins income
payments under

i4LIFE

®
Advantage.  The income base is equal to the initial deposit (or contract
value, if elected after issue) and increases by 15% every three years (subject
to a 200% cap).  The owner may step up the income base on or after the
third anniversary of rider election or of the most recent step-up (which also
resets the 200% cap).


The

Lincoln Lifetime Income

SM

Advantage and

Lincoln Lifetime
Income

SM

Advantage Plus are hybrid benefit riders combining aspects of GWB and GIB.
 Both benefit riders allow the contract holder the ability to take income
at a maximum rate of 5% of the guaranteed amount when they are above the
lifetime income age or income through

i4LIFE

® Advantage with the
GIB.

Lincoln Lifetime
Income

SM

Advantage and

Lincoln Lifetime
Income

SM

Advantage Plus provide higher income if the contract holder delays withdrawals,
including both a 5% enhancement to the guaranteed amount each year a withdrawal
is not taken for a specified period of time and an annual step-up of the
guaranteed amount to the current contract value.  The

Lincoln Lifetime Income

SM

Advantage Plus provides an additional benefit, which is a return of principal at
the end of the seventh year if the customer has not taken any
withdrawals.  Contract holders under both the

Lincoln Lifetime Income

SM

Advantage and

Lincoln Lifetime
Income

SM

Advantage Plus are subject to restrictions on the allocation of their account
value within the various investment choices.  Approximately 17% and 8%
of variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, had a

Lincoln
Lifetime Income

SM

Advantage or

Lincoln Lifetime
Income

SM

Advantage Plus rider.

To
mitigate the increased risks associated with guaranteed benefits, we developed a
dynamic hedging program.  The customized dynamic hedging program uses
equity and interest rate futures positions, interest rate and variance swaps, as
well as equity-based options depending upon the risks underlying the
guarantees.  Our program is designed to offset both positive and
negative changes in the carrying value of the guarantees.  However,
while we actively manage these hedge positions, the hedge positions may not be
effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees
due to, among other things, the time lag between changes in their values and
corresponding changes in the hedge positions, high levels of volatility in the
equity markets, contract holder behavior, management decisions not to fully
hedge every risk and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds
and hedging indices, which is referred to as basis risk.  For more
information on our hedging program, see “Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates – Derivatives” and “Realized Loss” in the MD&A.  For
information regarding risks related to guaranteed benefits, see “Item 1A. Risk
Factors – Changes in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affect
the profitability of our products with guaranteed benefits; therefore, such
changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and
profitability.”

Fixed
Annuities

A fixed
annuity preserves the principal value of the contract while guaranteeing a
minimum interest rate to be credited to the accumulation value.  We
offer single and flexible premium fixed deferred annuities to the individual
annuities market.  Single premium fixed deferred annuities are
contracts that allow only a single premium to be paid.  Flexible
premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow multiple premium
payments on either a scheduled or non-scheduled basis.  Our fixed
annuities include both traditional fixed-rate and fixed indexed
annuities.  With fixed deferred annuities, the contract holder has the
right to surrender the contract and receive the current accumulation value less
any applicable surrender charge and, if applicable, a market value adjustment
(“MVA”).  Depending on market conditions, MVAs can, for some products,
be less than zero, which means the MVA results in an increase to the amount
received by the contract holder.

Fixed
indexed annuities allow the contract holder to elect an interest rate linked to
the performance of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P
500”).  The indexed interest rate is guaranteed never to be less than
zero.  Our fixed indexed annuities provide contract holders a choice
of a traditional fixed-rate account and one or more different indexed
accounts.  A contract holder may elect to change allocations at
renewal dates, either annually or biannually.  At each renewal date,
we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component (i.e. reset the caps,
spreads or participation rates), subject to guarantees.

Fixed
annuity contracts are general account obligations.  We bear the
investment risk for fixed annuity contracts.  To protect from
premature withdrawals, we impose surrender charges.  Surrender charges
are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, with a
declining level of surrender charges over time.  We expect to earn a
spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments
supporting the fixed annuity product line and what we credit to our fixed
annuity contract holders’ accounts.  In addition, with respect to
fixed indexed annuities, we purchase options that are highly correlated to the
indexed account allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are
closely hedged with respect to indexed interest for the current reset
period.  For more information on our hedging program for fixed indexed
annuities, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives” and
“Realized Loss” in the MD&A.

Individual
fixed annuity account values were $15.9 billion, $14.0 billion and $14.4 billion
as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Approximately
$11.8 billion of individual fixed annuity account values as of December 31,
2009, were still within the surrender charge period.


Our fixed
annuity product offerings as of December 31, 2009, consisted of traditional
fixed-rate and fixed indexed deferred annuities, as well as fixed-rate immediate
annuities with various payment options, including lifetime
incomes.  In addition to traditional fixed-rate immediate annuities,
in 2007 we introduced

Lincoln
SmartIncome

SM

Inflation Annuity.  This product provides lifetime income with annual
adjustments to keep pace with inflation.  It uses a patent-pending
design to preserve access to remaining principal, also adjusted annually for
inflation, for premature death or unexpected needs.  The traditional
fixed-rate deferred annuity products include the

Lincoln Classic

SM

(Single and Flexible Premium),

Lincoln Select

SM

and

Lincoln ChoicePlus

SM

Fixed annuities.  The fixed indexed deferred annuity products include
the Lincoln

OptiPoint

®,

Lincoln OptiChoice

SM

,

Lincoln New Directions

®
and

Lincoln

Future Point

®
annuities.  The fixed indexed annuities offer one or more of the
following indexed accounts:

·

The
      Performance Triggered Indexed Account pays a specified rate, declared at
      the beginning of the indexed term, if the S&P 500 value at the end of
      the indexed term is the same or greater than the S&P 500 value at the
      beginning of the indexed term;

·

The
      Point to Point Indexed Account compares the value of the S&P 500 at
      the end of the indexed term to the S&P 500 value at the beginning of
      the term.  If the S&P 500 at the end of the indexed term is
      higher than the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the term, then the
      percentage change, up to the declared indexed interest cap, is credited to
      the indexed account;

·

The
      Monthly Cap Indexed Account reflects the monthly changes in the S&P
      500 value over the course of the indexed term.  Each month, the
      percentage change in the S&P 500 value is calculated, subject to a
      monthly indexed cap that is declared at the beginning of the indexed
      term.  At the end of the indexed term, all of the monthly change
      percentages are summed to determine the rate of indexed interest that will
      be credited to the account; and

·

The
      Monthly Average Indexed Account compares the average monthly value of the
      S&P 500 to the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the
      term.  The average of the S&P 500 values at the end of each
      of the twelve months in the indexed term is calculated.  The
      percentage change of the average S&P 500 value to the starting S&P
      500 value is calculated.  From that amount, the indexed interest
      spread, which is declared at the beginning of the indexed term, is
      subtracted.  The resulting rate is used to calculate the indexed
      interest that will be credited to the
account.

If the
S&P 500 values produce a negative indexed interest rate, no indexed interest
is credited to the indexed account.

During
2009, we added new traditional fixed annuity products,

Lincoln MYGuarantee

SM

Plus
and

Lincoln
GrowSmart

SM

Fixed Annuity, with multi-year guarantee periods that vary from 3-10 years to
allow consumers greater flexibility.

We
introduced the

Lincoln Living
Income

SM

Advantage in 2007.  Available with certain of our fixed indexed
annuities, it provides the contract holder a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal
benefit.  Withdrawals in excess of the free amount are assessed any
applicable surrender charges, and the guaranteed withdrawal amount is
recalculated.

Many of
our fixed annuities have an MVA.  If a contract with an MVA is
surrendered during the surrender charge period, both a surrender charge and an
MVA may be applied.  The MVA feature increases or decreases the
contract value of the annuity based on a decrease or increase in interest
rates.  We updated our MVA formula, during 2009, which provides better
protection when changes in available asset yields are not in line with changes
in Treasury rates.  Individual fixed annuities with an MVA feature
constituted 55%, 46% and 40% of total fixed annuity account values as of
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Distribution

The
Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment distributes its individual fixed and
variable annuity products through LFD.  LFD’s distribution channels
give the Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment access to its target
markets.  LFD distributes the segment’s products to a large number of
financial intermediaries, including LFN.  The financial intermediaries
include wire/regional firms, independent financial planners, financial
institutions and managing general agents.

Competition

The
annuities market is very competitive and consists of many companies, with no one
company dominating the market for all products.  The Annuities segment
competes with numerous other financial services companies.  The main
factors upon which entities in this market compete are distribution channel
access and the quality of wholesalers, investment performance, cost, product
features, speed to market, brand recognition, financial strength ratings,
crediting rates and client service.


Retirement
Solutions – Defined Contribution

Overview

The
Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segment provides employers the
ability to offer tax-deferred retirement savings plans to their employees,
primarily through 403(b) and 401(k) retirement savings plans.  We
provide a variety of plan investment vehicles, including individual and group
variable annuities, group fixed annuities and mutual funds.  We also
offer a broad array of plan services including plan recordkeeping, compliance
testing, participant education and other related services.

DC plans
are a popular employee benefit offered by many employers across a wide spectrum
of industries and by employers large and small.  Some plans include
employer matching of contributions, which can increase participation by
employees.  Growth in the number of DC plans has occurred as these
plans have been used as replacements for frozen or eliminated defined benefit
retirement plans.  In general, DC plans offer tax-deferred
contributions and investment growth, thereby deferring the tax consequences of
both the contributions and investment growth until withdrawals are made from the
accumulated values, often at lower tax rates occurring during
retirement.

Lincoln’s
403(b) assets accounted for 58% of total assets under management in this segment
as of December 31, 2009.  The 401(k) business accounted for 43% of our
deposits during 2009 for this segment.

management fees, surrender charges and recordkeeping fees from this
product.  We also receive fees from the underlying mutual funds
companies for the services we provide and we also earn investment margins on
assets in the fixed account.  Account values for LINCOLN DIRECTOR

services.  Included in the product offering is the LIFESPAN®

learning program, which
provides participants with educational materials and one-on-one guidance for
retirement planning assistance.  The program allows the use of any
retail mutual fund.  We earn fees for our recordkeeping and
educational services and the services we provide to mutual fund
accounts.  We also earn investment margins on fixed
annuities.  The retail mutual funds associated with this program are
not included in the separate accounts reported on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets, as we do not have any ownership interest in them.

LINCOLN ALLIANCE

31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The

Lincoln SmartFuture

® program
is a DC retirement plan solution aimed at small to mid to large employers,
typically those that have DC plans with between $3 million to $15 million or
more in account value.  The target market is primarily for-profit
corporations, educational institutions and healthcare providers.  The

provide to mutual fund accounts.  We also earn investment margins on
fixed annuities.  The retail mutual funds associated with this program
are not included in the separate accounts reported on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets, as we do not have any ownership interest in them.

Lincoln SmartFuture

Distribution

DC
products are primarily distributed by LFD.  The wholesalers distribute
these products through advisors, consultants, banks, wirehouses, TPAs and
individual planners.  Although the

SM

group
variable annuity is sold primarily by TPAs and individual planners and is
in the early stages of introduction to wirehouses and banks.

Competition

The DC
marketplace is very competitive and is comprised of many providers, with no one
company dominating the market for all products.  We compete with
numerous other financial services companies.  The main factors upon
which entities in this market compete are distribution channel access and the
quality of wholesalers, investment performance, cost, product features, speed to
market, brand recognition, financial strength ratings, crediting rates and
client service.

INSURANCE
SOLUTIONS

The
Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two
segments:  Life Insurance and Group Protection.  The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and
transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product and both
single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including COLI and BOLI
products.  The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment offers
group life, disability and dental insurance primarily in the small- to mid-sized
employer marketplace for their eligible employees.

Insurance
Solutions – Life Insurance

Overview

The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment, with principal operations in
Greensboro, North Carolina and Hartford, Connecticut and additional operations
in Concord, New Hampshire and Fort Wayne, Indiana, focuses on the creation and
protection of wealth for its clients through the manufacturing of life insurance
products.  The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers
wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a
linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for
long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL,
including COLI and BOLI products.

The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment primarily targets the affluent to
high net worth markets, defined as households with at least $250,000 of
financial assets.  For those individual policies we sold in 2009, the
average face amount (excluding term and MoneyGuard® products) was $1 million and
average first year premiums paid were approximately $50,000.

The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment also offers COLI and BOLI products
and services to small- to mid-sized banks and mid- to large-sized corporations,
mostly through executive benefit brokers.


Products

The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment sells primarily
interest/market-sensitive products (UL and VUL), including COLI and BOLI
products, and term products.  The segment’s sales (in millions) were
as follows:

UL and
VUL sales (including COLI and BOLI), represent first year commissionable
premiums plus 5% of excess premium received, including an adjustment for
internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums; whole
life and term sales represent 100% of first year paid premiums; and
linked-benefit sales represent 15% of premium deposits.

The
segment generally has higher sales in the second half of the year than in the
first half of the year.  Approximately 44% and 46% of total sales were
in the first half of 2009 and 2008, respectively; however, in 2007,
approximately 50% of total sales were in the first half of the
year.  In 2007, this was due to the transition of our product
portfolio to the new unified product portfolio.

Life
policies’ in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:

Mortality
margins, morbidity margins (for linked-benefit products), investment margins
(through spreads or fees), net expense charges (expense charges assessed to the
contract holder less expenses incurred to manage the business) and surrender
fees drive life insurance profits.  Mortality margins represent the
difference between amounts charged to the customer to cover the mortality risk
and the actual cost of reinsurance and death benefits paid.  Mortality
charges are either specifically deducted from the contract holder’s policy
account value (i.e., cost of insurance assessments or “COIs”) or are embedded in
the premiums charged to the customer.  In either case, these amounts
are a function of the rates priced into the product and level of insurance in
force (less reserves previously set aside to fund
benefits).  Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales,
persistency and mortality experience.

Similar
to the annuity product classifications described above, life products can be
classified as “fixed” or “variable” contracts.  This classification
describes whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the
assets supporting the policy.  This also determines the manner in
which we earn investment margin profits from these products, either as
investment spreads for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable
products.

We offer
four categories of life insurance products consisting of:

Interest-sensitive
Life Insurance (Primarily UL)

Interest-sensitive
life insurance products provide life insurance with account (cash) values that
earn rates of return based on company-declared interest
rates.  Contract holder account values are invested in our general
account investment portfolio, so we bear the risk of investment
performance.  Some of our UL contracts include secondary guarantees,
which are explained more fully below.


In a UL
contract, contract holders have flexibility in the timing and amount of premium
payments and the amount of death benefit, provided there is sufficient account
value to cover all policy charges for mortality and expenses for the coming
period.  Under certain contract holder options and market conditions,
the death benefit amount may increase or decrease.  Premiums received
on a UL product, net of expense loads and charges, are added to the contract
holder’s account value.  The client has access to their account value
(or a portion thereof) through contractual liquidity features such as loans,
partial withdrawals and full surrenders.  Loans and withdrawals reduce
the death benefit amount payable and are limited to certain contractual maximums
(some of which are required under state law), and interest is charged on all
loans.  Our UL contracts assess surrender charges against the
policies’ account values for full or partial face amount surrenders that occur
during the contractual surrender charge period.  Depending on the
product selected, surrender charge periods can range from 0 to 20
years.

We also
offer a fixed indexed UL product that functions similarly to a traditional UL
policy, with the added flexibility of allowing contract holders to have portions
of their account value earn interest credits linked to the performance of the
S&P 500.  The indexed interest rate is guaranteed never to be less
than 1%.  Our fixed indexed UL policy provides contract holders a
choice of a traditional fixed rate account and several different indexed
accounts.  A contract holder may elect to change allocations annually
for amounts in the indexed accounts and quarterly for new premiums into the
policy.  Prior to each new allocation, we have the opportunity to
re-price the indexed components, subject to minimum guarantees.

As
mentioned previously, we offer survivorship versions of our individual UL
products.  These products insure two lives with a single policy and
pay death benefits upon the second death.

Sales
results are heavily influenced by the series of UL products with secondary
guarantees.  A UL policy with a secondary guarantee can stay in force,
even if the base policy account value is zero, as long as secondary guarantee
requirements have been met.  The secondary guarantee requirement is
based on the evaluation of a reference value within the policy, calculated in a
manner similar to the base policy account value, but using different assumptions
as to expense charges, COI charges and credited interest.  The
assumptions for the secondary guarantee requirement are listed in the
contract.  As long as the contract holder funds the policy to a level
that keeps this calculated reference value positive, the death benefit will be
guaranteed.  The reference value has no actual monetary value to the
contract holder; it is only a calculated value used to determine whether or not
the policy will lapse should the base policy account value be less than zero.

Unlike
other GDB designs, our secondary guarantee benefits maintain the flexibility of
a traditional UL policy, which allows a contract holder to take loans or
withdrawals.  Although loans and withdrawals are likely to shorten the
time period of the guaranteed death benefit, the guarantee is not automatically
or completely forfeited, as is sometimes the case with other death benefit
guarantee designs.  The length of the guarantee may be increased at
any time through additional excess premium deposits.  Secondary
guarantee UL face amount in force was $110.4 billion, $99.0 billion and $83.9
billion as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  For
information on the reserving requirements for this business, see “Regulatory”
below and “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” in the
MD&A.

We manage
investment margins (i.e., the difference between the amount the portfolio earns
compared to the amount that is credited to the customer) by seeking to maximize
current yields, in line with asset/liability and risk management targets, while
crediting a competitive rate to the customer.  Crediting rates are
typically subject to guaranteed minimums specified in the underlying life
insurance contract.  Interest-sensitive life account values (including

MoneyGuard

® and the
fixed portion of VUL) were $27.3 billion, $27.5 billion and $26.5 billion as of
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Linked-benefit
Life Products

Linked-benefit
life products combine UL with long-term care insurance through the use of
riders.  The first rider allows the contract holder to accelerate
death benefits on a tax-free basis in the event of a qualified long-term care
need.  The second rider extends the long-term care insurance benefits
for an additional period of time if the death benefit is fully depleted for the
purposes of long-term care.  If the long-term care benefits are never
used, the policy provides a tax-free death benefit to the contract holder’s
heirs.  Linked-benefit life products generate earnings through
investment, mortality and morbidity margins.

MoneyGuard

® products are
linked-benefit life products.


VUL

VUL
products are UL products that provide a return on account values linked to an
underlying investment portfolio of sub-accounts offered through the
product.  The value of the contract holder’s account varies with the
performance of the sub-accounts chosen by the contract holder.  The
underlying assets of the sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance
series of mutual funds.  Premiums, net of expense loads and charges
for mortality and expenses, received on VUL products are invested according to
the contract holder’s investment option selection.  As the return on
the investment portfolio increases or decreases, the account value of the VUL
policy will increase or decrease.  As with fixed UL products, contract
holders have access, within contractual maximums, to account values through
loans, withdrawals and surrenders.  Surrender charges are assessed
during the surrender charge period, ranging from 0 to 20 years depending on the
product.  The investment choices we offer in VUL products are the
same, in most cases, as the investment choices offered in our individual
variable annuity contracts.

In
addition, VUL products offer a fixed account option that is managed by
us.  Investment risk is borne by the customer on all but the fixed
account option.  We charge fees for mortality costs and administrative
expenses as well as asset-based investment management fees.  VUL
account values (excluding the fixed portion of VUL) were $4.5 billion, $4.3
billion and $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

We also
offer survivorship versions of our individual VUL products.  These
products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the
second death.

We also
offer an enhanced single life

version
of our secondary guarantee VUL products with a survivorship
option.  These products combine the lapse protection elements of UL
with the upside potential of a traditional VUL product, giving clients the
flexibility to choose the appropriate balance between protection and market risk
that meets their individual needs.  The combined single life and
survivorship face amount in force of these products was $5.3 billion, $4.9
billion and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Term
Life Insurance

Term life
insurance provides a fixed death benefit for a scheduled period of
time.  It usually does not offer cash values.  Scheduled
policy premiums are required to be paid at least annually.  Products
offering a return of premium benefit payable at the end of a specified period
are also available.

Distribution

The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment’s products are sold through
LFD.  LFD provides the Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment
with access to financial intermediaries in the following primary distribution
channels:  wire/regional firms; independent planner firms (including
LFN); financial institutions; and managing general agents/independent marketing
organizations.  LFD primarily distributes COLI and BOLI products to 14
intermediaries who specialize in the executive benefits market and are serviced
through a network of internal and external sales professionals

Competition

The life
insurance industry is very competitive and consists of many companies with no
one company dominating the market for all products.  As of the end of
2008, the latest year for which data is available, there were 976 life insurance
companies in the U.S., according to the American Council of Life
Insurers.

The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment competes on product design and
customer service.  The Insurance Solutions –Life Insurance segment
designs products specifically for the high net worth and affluent
markets.  In addition to the growth opportunity offered by its target
market, our product breadth, design innovation, competitiveness, speed to
market, customer service, underwriting and risk management and extensive
distribution network all contribute to the strength of the Insurance Solutions –
Life Insurance segment.  On average, the development of products takes
approximately six months.  The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance
segment implemented several major product upgrades and/or new features,
including important UL, VUL, linked-benefit and term product enhancements in
2009.  With respect to customer service, management tracks the speed,
accuracy and responsiveness of service to customers’ calls and transaction
requests.  Further, the Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment
tracks the turnaround time and quality for various client services such as
processing of applications.


Underwriting

In the
context of life insurance, underwriting is the process of evaluating medical and
non-medical information about an individual and determining the effect these
factors statistically have on life expectancy or mortality.  This
process of evaluation is often referred to as risk classification.  Of
course, no one can accurately predict how long any individual will live, but
certain risk factors can affect life expectancy and are evaluated during the
underwriting process.

Claims
Administration

Claims
services are delivered to customers from the Greensboro, North Carolina and
Concord, New Hampshire home offices.  Claims examiners are assigned to
each claim notification based on coverage amount, type of claim and the
experience of the examiner.  Claims meeting certain criteria are
referred to senior claim examiners.  A formal quality assurance
program is carried out to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of claims
examining activities.  A network of in-house legal counsel, compliance
officers, medical personnel and an anti-fraud investigative unit also support
claim examiners.  A special team of claims examiners, in conjunction
with claims management, focus on more complex claims matters such as long-term
care claims, claims incurred during the contestable period, beneficiary
disputes, litigated claims and the few invalid claims that are
encountered.

The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment maintains a centralized claim
service center in order to minimize the volume of clerical and repetitive
administrative demands on its claims examiners while providing convenient
service to policy owners and beneficiaries.

Insurance
Solutions – Group Protection

Overview

The
Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment based in Omaha, Nebraska offers
group non-medical insurance products, principally term life, disability and
dental, to the employer marketplace through various forms of contributory and
noncontributory plans.  Most of the segment’s group contracts are sold
to employers with fewer than 500 employees.

Group
Life Insurance

We offer
employer-sponsored group term life insurance products including basic, optional
and voluntary term life insurance to employees and their
dependents.  Additional benefits may be provided in the event of a
covered individual’s accidental death or dismemberment.

Group
Disability Insurance

We offer
short- and long-term employer-sponsored group disability insurance, which
protects an employee against loss of wages due to illness or
injury.  Short-term disability generally provides benefits for up to
26 weeks following a short waiting period, ranging from 1 to 30
days.  Long-term disability provides benefits following a longer
waiting period, usually between 30 and 180 days and provides benefits for a
longer period, at least 2 years and typically extending to normal (Social
Security) retirement age.


Group
Dental

We offer
employer-sponsored group dental insurance, which covers a portion of the cost of
eligible dental procedures for employees and their
dependents.  Products offered include indemnity coverage, which does
not distinguish benefits based on a dental provider’s participation in a network
arrangement, and a Preferred Provider Organization (“PPO”) product that does
reflect the dental provider’s participation in the PPO network arrangement,
including agreement with network fee schedules.

Distribution

The
segment’s products are marketed primarily through a national distribution
system, including approximately 140 managers and marketing
representatives.  The managers and marketing representatives develop
business through employee benefit brokers, TPAs and other employee benefit
firms.

Competition

The group
protection marketplace is very competitive.  Principal competitive
factors include particular product features, price, quality of customer service
and claims management, technological capabilities, financial strength and
claims-paying ratings.  In the group insurance market, the Insurance
Solutions – Group Protection segment competes with a limited number of major
companies and selected other companies that focus on these
products.

Underwriting

The
Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment’s underwriters evaluate the risk
characteristics of each employee group.  Generally, the relevant
characteristics evaluated include employee census information (such as age,
gender, income and occupation), employer industry classification, geographic
location, benefit design elements and other factors.  The segment
employs detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures designed to
assist the underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks.  The
segment uses technology to efficiently review, price and issue smaller cases,
utilizing its underwriting staff on larger, more complex
cases.  Individual underwriting techniques (including evaluation of
individual medical history information) may be used on certain covered
individuals selecting larger benefit amounts.  For voluntary and other
forms of employee paid coverages, minimum participation requirements are used to
obtain a better spread of risk and minimize the risk of
anti-selection.

Claims
Administration

Claims
for the Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment are managed by a staff of
experienced claim specialists.  Disability claims management is
especially important to segment results, as results depend on both the incidence
and the length of approved disability claims.  The segment employs
nurses and rehabilitation specialists to help evaluate medical conditions and
develop return to work plans.  Independent medical reviews are
routinely performed by external medical professionals to further evaluate
conditions as part of the claim management process.

OTHER
OPERATIONS

Other
Operations includes the results of operations that are not directly related
to the business segments, unallocated corporate items and the ongoing
amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity reinsurance portion of the sale
of our former reinsurance segment to Swiss Re in the fourth quarter of
2001.  Unallocated corporate items include investment income on
investments related to the amount of statutory surplus in our insurance
subsidiaries that is not allocated to our business units and other corporate
investments, such as our remaining radio properties, interest expense on
short-term and long-term borrowings, our closed block of run-off pension
business in the form of group annuity and insured funding-type of contracts with
assets under management of approximately $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2009,
and certain expenses, including restructuring and merger-related expenses. Other
Operations also includes the results of certain disability income business due
to the rescission of the indemnity reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re and the
results of our remaining media businesses.

REINSURANCE

We follow
the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our life insurance and annuity
risks with unaffiliated reinsurers.  In a reinsurance transaction, a
reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability
under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon
premium.  We use reinsurance to protect our insurance subsidiaries
against the severity of losses on individual claims and unusually serious
occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary
loss.  We also use reinsurance to improve our results by leveraging
favorable reinsurance pricing.  Although reinsurance does not
discharge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to their
contract holders for losses insured under the insurance policies, it does make
the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured
portion of the risk.  Because we bear the risk of nonpayment by one or
more of our reinsurers, we primarily cede reinsurance to well-capitalized,
highly rated reinsurers.

We
reinsure approximately 45% to 50% of the mortality risk on newly issued non-term
life insurance contracts and approximately 30% to 35% of total mortality risk
including term insurance contracts.  Our policy for this program is to
retain no more than $10 million on a single insured life issued on fixed and VUL
insurance contracts.  Additionally, the retention per single insured
life for term life insurance and for COLI is $2 million for each type of
insurance.

Portions
of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance
(“Modco”) basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate
risks.  In a Modco program, the reinsurer shares proportionally in all
financial terms of the reinsured policies (i.e. premiums, expenses, claims,
etc.) based on their respective quota share of the risk.

In
addition, we acquire other reinsurance to cover products other than as discussed
above with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for
the circumstances.

We obtain
reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers and we monitor concentration and
financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.  Swiss Re
represents our largest exposure.  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
the amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $6.4 billion and $8.4 billion,
respectively, of which $3.0 billion and $4.5 billion was recoverable from Swiss
Re for the same periods, respectively.

For more
information regarding reinsurance, see “Reinsurance” in the MD&A and Note
9.  For risks involving reinsurance, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – We
face a risk of non-collectibility of reinsurance, which could materially affect
our results of operations.”

RESERVES

The
applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that
they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their
outstanding policies.  These reserves are the amounts that, with the
additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at
certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various
policy and contract obligations as they mature.  These laws specify
that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain
specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of
valuation.

For more
information on reserves, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates –
Derivatives” and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract
Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations” in the MD&A.

See
“Regulatory” below for information on permitted practices and proposed
regulations that may impact the amount of statutory reserves necessary to
support our current insurance liabilities.


For risks
related to reserves, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates may
cause interest rate spreads to decrease and may result in increased contract
withdrawals.”

INVESTMENTS

An
important component of our financial results is the return on invested
assets.  Our investment strategy is to balance the need for current
income with prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient
current income to meet our obligations.  This approach requires the
evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class utilized, while still
meeting our income objectives.  This approach also permits us to be
more effective in our asset-liability management because decisions can be made
based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations
affecting assets and liabilities.  Investments by our insurance
subsidiaries must comply with the insurance laws and regulations of the states
of domicile.

We do not
use derivatives for speculative purposes.  Derivatives are used for
hedging purposes and income generation.  Hedging strategies are
employed for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, hedging certain
portions of our exposure to changes in our GDB, GWB and GIB liabilities,
interest rate fluctuations, the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable
maturity U.S. Government obligations and credit, foreign exchange and equity
risks.  Income generation strategies include credit default swaps
through replication synthetic asset transactions.  These derivatives
synthetically create exposure in the general account to corporate debt, similar
to investing in the credit markets.

As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, our most significant investment in one issuer was
our investment securities issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
with a fair value of $4.8 billion and $3.5 billion, or 6% and 5% of our invested
assets portfolio totaling $75.9 billion and $66.5 billion,
respectively.  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our most significant
investment in one industry was our investment securities in
the collateralized mortgage obligation industry with a fair value of $6.9
billion and $6.8 billion, or 9% and 10% of the invested assets portfolio,
respectively.

For
additional information on our investments, including carrying values by
category, quality ratings and net investment income, see “Consolidated
Investments” in the MD&A, as well as Notes 1 and 5.

RATINGS

The
Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations rate the financial
strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and the debt of
LNC.  Ratings are not recommendations to buy our
securities.

Rating
agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to
pay claims, factors more relevant to contract holders than
investors.  We believe that the ratings assigned by nationally
recognized, independent rating agencies are material to our
operations.  There may be other rating agencies that also rate our
securities, which we do not disclose in our reports.

A
downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt
with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely
increase our cost of capital.  In addition, a downgrade of these
ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing
debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and
to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal
insurance subsidiaries described above.

All
ratings are on outlook negative, with the exception of S&P, which is
stable.  All of our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at
any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that
our principal insurance subsidiaries or LNC can maintain these
ratings.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

REGULATORY

Insurance
Regulation

Our
insurance subsidiaries, like other insurance companies, are subject to
regulation and supervision by the states, territories and countries in which
they are licensed to do business.  The extent of such regulation
varies, but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory,
supervisory and administrative authority to supervisory agencies.  In
the U.S., this power is vested in state insurance departments.

In
supervising and regulating insurance companies, state insurance departments,
charged primarily with protecting contract holders and the public rather than
investors, enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance
laws and regulation for that purpose.  Our principal insurance
subsidiaries, LNL, LLANY and FPP, are domiciled in the states of Indiana, New
York and Indiana, respectively.


The
insurance departments of the domiciliary states exercise principal regulatory
jurisdiction over our insurance subsidiaries.  The extent of
regulation by the states varies, but in general, most jurisdictions have laws
and regulations governing standards of solvency, adequacy of reserves,
reinsurance, capital adequacy, licensing of companies and agents to transact
business, prescribing and approving policy forms, regulating premium rates for
some lines of business, prescribing the form and content of financial statements
and reports, regulating the type and amount of investments permitted and
standards of business conduct.   Insurance company regulation is
discussed further under “Insurance Holding Company Regulation” and “Restrictions
on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments.”

As part
of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct
periodic, generally once every three to five years, examinations of the books,
records, accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their
states.  During the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, we
have not received any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance
department examinations of our insurance subsidiaries conducted during this
three-year period.

State
insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to file
financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do
business, and the operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are
subject to examination by those departments at any time.  Our U.S.
insurance companies prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with
accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these
departments.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(“NAIC”) has approved a series of statutory accounting principles that have been
adopted, in some cases with minor modifications, by virtually all state
insurance departments.

The NAIC
allows our U.S. insurance subsidiaries to include certain deferred tax assets in
our statutory capital and surplus, but we are not able to consider the benefit
from this when calculating available dividends.

A new
statutory reserving standard, Actuarial Guideline 43, Commissioners Annuity
Reserve Valuation Method for Variable Annuities (“VACARVM”), replaced previous
statutory reserving practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits,
such as GWBs.  VACARVM was adopted by the NAIC in September 2008 and was
effective as of December 31, 2009. The effect of the adoption was dependent
upon several factors, including account values, market conditions,
the carrying value of derivative and other assets as compared to the
carrying value of the reserves (whose change in value may be
uncorrelated with the new reserving requirements) they supported and the
use of captive or third-party reinsurance that existed as of December 31,
2009.  For more information on VACARVM and our use of captive
reinsurance structures, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition –
Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the MD&A.

Insurance
Holding Company Regulation

LNC and
its primary insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the
insurance holding company laws of the states of Indiana and New
York.  These insurance holding company laws generally require an
insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such insurance
holding company’s system to register with the insurance department authorities,
to file with it certain reports disclosing information, including their capital
structure, ownership, management, financial condition, and certain inter-company
transactions, including material transfers of assets and inter-company business
agreements and to report material changes in that information.  These
laws also require that inter-company transactions be fair and reasonable and,
under certain circumstances, prior approval of the insurance departments must be
received before entering into an inter-company transaction.  Further,
these laws require that an insurer’s contract holders’ surplus following any
dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates is reasonable in relation
to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial
needs.

In
general, under state holding company regulations, no person may acquire,
directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in our capital stock unless such
person, corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the
applicable insurance commissioner for such acquisition of
control.  Pursuant to such laws, in general, any person acquiring,
controlling or holding the power to vote, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of
the voting securities of an insurance company, is presumed to have “control” of
such company.  This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that
control does not exist in fact.  The insurance commissioner, however,
may find that “control” exists in circumstances in which a person owns or
controls a smaller amount of voting securities.  To obtain approval
from the insurance commissioner of any acquisition of control of an insurance
company, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an
application containing information regarding:  the identity and
background of the acquirer and its affiliates; the nature, source and amount of
funds to be used to carry out the acquisition; the financial statements of the
acquirer and its affiliates; any potential plans for disposition of the
securities or business of the insurer; the number and type of securities to be
acquired; any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired; any
agreements with broker-dealers; and other matters.


Other
jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact
business may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of any
acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or
authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions.  Additional
requirements in those jurisdictions may include re-licensing or subsequent
approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of
control.  As further described below, laws that govern the holding
company structure also govern payment of dividends to us by our insurance
subsidiaries.

Restrictions
on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments

We are a
holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and
indirectly through subsidiaries.  Our primary assets are the stock of
our operating subsidiaries.  Our ability to meet our obligations on
our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative
expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability
of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to
us.

Our
insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory
restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding
company.  Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance
subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends
to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the
“Commissioner”), only from unassigned surplus or must receive prior approval of
the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other
dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, would exceed the
statutory limitation.  The current statutory limitation is the

greater

of 10% of the
insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on
file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations
for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned
surplus.  As discussed above, we may not consider the benefit from the
statutory accounting principles relating to our insurance subsidiaries’ deferred
tax assets in calculating available dividends.  Indiana law gives the
Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of
these limits.  New York, the state of domicile of our other major
insurance subsidiary, LLANY, has similar restrictions, except that in New York
it is the

lesser

of 10% of
surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net
gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including
realized capital gains.

Indiana
law also provides that following the payment of any dividend, the insurer’s
contract holders’ surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding
liabilities and adequate for its financial needs, and permits the Commissioner
to bring an action to rescind a dividend which violates these
standards.  In the event that the Commissioner determines that the
contract holders’ surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate, the Commissioner
could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to
apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit of that
insurance subsidiary.  For information regarding dividends paid to us
during 2009 from our insurance subsidiaries, see “Review of Consolidated
Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and
Cash Flow” in the MD&A.

Risk-Based
Capital (“RBC”)

The NAIC
has adopted RBC requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the
adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and
insurance risks.  The requirements provide a means of measuring the
minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to
support its overall business operations based on its size and risk
profile.  There are five major risks involved in determining the
requirements:

Category

Name

Description

Asset
      risk - affiliates

C-0

Risk
      of assets' default for certain affiliated investments

Asset
      risk - other

C-1

Risk
      of assets' default of principal and interest or

fluctuation
      in fair value

Insurance
      risk

C-2

Risk
      of underestimating liabilities from business already

written
      or inadequately pricing business to be written in

the
      future

Interest
      rate risk, health credit

C-3

Risk
      of losses due to changes in interest rate levels, risk

risk
      and market risk

that
      health benefits prepaid to providers become the

obligation
      of the health insurer once again and risk of

loss
      due to changes in market levels associated with

variable
      products with guarantees

Business
      risk

C-4

Risk
      of general business


A
company’s risk-based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and
performing calculations relating to various asset, premium, claim, expense and
reserve items.  Regulators can then measure adequacy of a company’s
statutory surplus by comparing it to the RBC determined by the
formula.  Under RBC requirements, regulatory compliance is determined
by the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to
its company action level of RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as defined by the
NAIC.  Accordingly, factors that have an impact on the total adjusted
capital of our insurance subsidiaries, such as the permitted practices discussed
above, will also affect their RBC levels.

Four
levels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the RBC ratio is
insufficient:

·

“Company
      action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 75% and 100%, then the insurer
      must submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it
      proposes to undertake;

·

“Regulatory
      action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 50% and 75%, then the insurer
      must submit a plan, but a regulator may also issue a corrective order
      requiring the insurer to comply within a specified
      period;

·

“Authorized
      control level” – If the RBC ratio is between 35% and 50%, then the
      regulatory response is the same as at the “Regulatory action level,” but
      in addition, the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate
      the insurer; and

·

“Mandatory
      control level” – If the RBC ratio is less than 35%, then the regulator
      must rehabilitate or liquidate the
insurer.

As of
December 31, 2009, the RBC ratios of LNL, LLANY and FPP reported to their
respective states of domicile and the NAIC all exceeded the “company action
level.”  We believe that we will be able to maintain the RBC ratios of
our insurance subsidiaries in excess of “company action level” through prudent
underwriting, claims handling, investing and capital
management.  However, no assurances can be given that developments
affecting the insurance subsidiaries, many of which could be outside of our
control, will not cause the RBC ratios to fall below our targeted
levels.  These developments may include, but may not be limited
to:  changes to the manner in which the RBC ratio is calculated; new
regulatory requirements for calculating reserves, such as principles based
reserving; economic conditions leading to higher levels of impairments of
securities in our insurance subsidiaries’ general accounts; and an inability to
finance life reserves including the issuing of letters of credit
supporting captive reinsurance structures.

See “Item
1A. Risk Factors – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance
subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial
strength ratings.”

Privacy
Regulations

In the
course of our business, we collect and maintain personal data from our customers
including personally identifiable non-public financial and health information,
which subjects us to regulation under federal and state privacy laws. 
These laws require that we institute certain policies and procedures in our
business to safeguard this information from improper use or disclosure.  If
the federal or state regulators establish further regulations for addressing
customer privacy, we may need to amend our policies and adapt our internal
procedures.

Federal
Initiatives

The U.S.
federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry; however,
federal initiatives from time to time can impact the insurance
industry.

Health
Care Reform Legislation

In 2009,
the House and the Senate passed health care reform legislation.  Many
details will need to be worked out before a final bill emerges, but both the
House and Senate bills as passed include a number of provisions that provide for
new or increased taxes to help finance the cost of these reforms, substantive
changes to existing health care laws and the addition of new health care and
related laws, each of which could potentially impact some of our lines of
businesses.

Financial
Reform Legislation

In 2009,
the House and the Senate both considered legislation related to financial
regulatory reform.  In December 2009, the House passed H.R. 4173, “The
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009,” a wide-ranging bill
that includes a number of reforms.  The bill includes, among other
things, a new harmonized fiduciary standard for broker-dealers and investment
advisers, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, the creation
of a pre-funded resolution trust to cover the costs of winding down certain
failing institutions, the creation of the Federal Insurance Office within the
Treasury Department and provisions relating to executive
compensation.  The current version of the bill would require insurance
companies to contribute funds to the resolution trust, but the amount the
Company would have to contribute is currently unknown.  Similar
legislation is currently under consideration, in draft form, in the Senate
Banking Committee.  The House bill will have to be reconciled before a
single bill could be sent to the President and signed into law.


Stimulus
Legislation

In
reaction to the recession, credit market illiquidity and global financial crisis
experienced during the latter part of 2008 and into 2009, Congress enacted the
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) on October 3, 2008, and
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) which was signed
into law on February 17, 2009, in an effort to restore liquidity to the U.S.
credit markets and to stimulate the U.S. economy.  The ARRA and the
Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) authorized the purchase of “troubled
assets” from financial institutions, including insurance
companies.  Pursuant to the authority granted under the TARP, the U.S.
Treasury also adopted the Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”), the Generally
Available Capital Access Program and the Exceptional Financial Recovery
Assistance Program.

TARP
CPP

On
November 13, 2008, we filed an application to participate in the CPP that was
established under the EESA.  On January 8, 2009, the Office of Thrift
Supervision approved our application to become a savings and loan holding
company and our acquisition of NCLS, a federally regulated savings bank located
in Indiana.  We contributed $10 million to the capital of NCLS and
closed on our purchase on January 15, 2009.  On May 8, 2009, the U.S.
Treasury granted us preliminary approval to participate in the
CPP.  On July 10, 2009, we issued, in a private placement, $950
million of Series B preferred stock and a warrant for 13,049,451 shares of our
common stock with an exercise price of $10.92 per share to the U.S. Treasury
under the CPP.  See “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition –
Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing
Activities” for more information about our preferred stock
issuance.

Participation
in the CPP subjects us to increased oversight by the U.S.
Treasury.  The U.S. Treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the
terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in
applicable statutes and to inspect our corporate books and records through our
federal banking regulators.  In addition, the U.S. Treasury has the
right to appoint two directors to our Board if we miss dividend payments on the
preferred stock as discussed below.  Participation in the CPP may also
subject us to increased Congressional scrutiny.

In
connection with participating in the CPP, because we registered as a savings and
loan holding company, we are subjected to new legal and regulatory requirements,
including minimum capital requirements, regulation and examination by the Office
of Thrift Supervision.

We are
also subject to certain restrictions, including limits on incentive compensation
for certain executives and employees for the duration of the U.S. Treasury’s
investment.  We are subject to limits on increasing the dividend on
our common stock and redeeming capital stock (unless the U.S. Treasury
consents), both of which apply until the third anniversary of the U.S.
Treasury’s investment unless we redeem the Series B preferred shares in whole or
the U.S. Treasury transfers all of the Series B preferred stock to third
parties.

Financial
Crisis Responsibility Fee

In
January 2010, the President proposed as a part of its budget proposal a new
“financial crisis responsibility fee” on certain financial institutions as a
means to recoup any shortfall in revenues resulting from the TARP program, so
that the program does not add to the federal budget deficit.  As
proposed, the fee would apply to financial institutions, including bank holding
companies, thrift holding companies, insured depositories, and insurance
companies that own one of these entities, with over $50 billion in assets,
regardless of whether the firm participated in the TARP program.  The
fee as proposed is expected to be an assessment of 15 basis points against a
calculated “covered liabilities” amount and would be in place for a minimum of
10 years.  Details as to the precise calculation of “covered
liabilities” are still unclear.  Legislation implementing this fee
will need to be introduced and passed by Congress before this tax would take
effect.

Federal
Tax Legislation

In June
2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (“EGTRRA”)
was enacted.  EGTRRA contains provisions that will continue in effect,
near term, the significantly lower individual tax rates.  These may
have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the inside build-up
of annuities and life insurance products.  EGTRRA also includes
provisions that eliminate the estate tax for a single year in 2010, while also
replacing the step-up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent’s
estate with a modified carryover basis rule.  EGTRRA also reduces the
gift tax rate in 2010 to the highest marginal rate (35% in
2010).  Some of these changes might hinder our sales and result in the
increased surrender of insurance and annuity products.  These
provisions all expire after 2010, unless extended. Should these provisions not
be extended, the higher marginal tax rates on individuals could have a positive
impact upon the sale of our insurance and annuity products.


In May
2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (“JGTRRA”) was
enacted.  Individual taxpayers are the principal beneficiaries of
JGTRRA, which accelerated certain of the income tax rate reductions enacted
originally under the EGTRRA, as well as reduced the long-term capital gains and
dividend tax rates to 15%.  On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase
Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 (“TIPRA”) was signed into
law.  TIPRA extended the lower capital gains and dividends rates
through the end of 2010.  Unless further extended, these rate
reductions expire after 2010.  Should the lower capital gains and
dividend rates not be extended beyond 2010, the higher rates on investment
income could have a positive impact on the sale of our insurance and annuity
products.

On August
17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) was signed into
law.  The PPA makes numerous changes to pension and other tax laws
including:  permanence for the EGTRRA enacted pension provisions
including higher annual contribution limits for DC plans and IRAs as well as
catch-up contributions for persons over age 50; clarification of the safest
available annuity standard for the selection of an annuity as a distribution
option for DC plans; expansion of investment advice options for DC plan
participants and IRA owners; more stringent funding requirements for defined
benefit pension plans and clarification of the legal status of hybrid (cash
balance) pension plans; non-pension related tax changes, such as the
codification of COLI best practices, bringing more certainty to this market
segment; permanence for EGTRRA enacted tax benefits for Section 529 college
savings plans; and favorable tax treatment for long-term care insurance included
as a rider to or on annuity products.  We expect many of these changes
to have a beneficial effect upon various segments of our business
lines.

On
February 1, 2010, the Obama Administration submitted to Congress its fiscal year
2011 budget proposal.  Included therein are policy and tax recommendations
that could have an effect upon our company and our products and many were
originally proposed in last year’s budget submission to Congress.  Included
among the various proposed policy recommendations are modifications to the
dividend received deduction for life insurance company separate accounts, a
permanent extension of the unemployment insurance surtax at the 8% rate,
codification of the economic substance doctrine, a doctrine that generally
denies tax benefits from a transaction that does not meaningfully change a
taxpayer’s economic position other than tax consequences and the imposition of a
Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee upon financial services firms with assets in
excess of $50 billion.  If these proposed changes were enacted into law or,
if applicable, changed through the rulemaking process, they could have an
adverse effect upon the company’s profitability.  The budget also proposes
changes to the tax laws that would affect individuals that purchase
products offered and sold  through our various business
lines, including such items as expanding the pro-rata disallowance for
COLI, changes to the estate tax, the expiration of lower marginal rates and
lower capital gains and dividends rates for certain upper-income taxpayers,
allowing partial annuitization of non-qualified annuity contracts, the creation
of an auto-enrollment IRA program for small employers and encouraging
increased use of qualified plans through tax credits to defray start up
costs.  Some of these proposed changes, should they become law, would
have the potential to improve the attractiveness of our products to consumers
and enhance our sales.  Other provisions could have the opposite
effect.  The submission of the Administration’s budget to
Congress begins the Budget Resolution process that, if successfully
passed, could potentially include some combination of the provisions
described above.  However, most of the proposed changes contained in either
the Administration’s budget submission to Congress or included in a
Congressional Budget Resolution should one be passed, would still require
separate legislation that would have to move through both houses of Congress
before being signed into law by the President.

Patriot
Act

The USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”) contains anti-money laundering and financial
transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations
applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including
insurance companies.  The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation
among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in
identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money
laundering.  Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain
provisions that may be different, conflicting or more rigorous.  The
increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers,
watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for
information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share
information with other financial institutions require the implementation and
maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.

Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) Considerations

ERISA is
a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans
sponsored by private employers and labor unions.  Plans subject to
ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including
health, life and disability plans.  ERISA provisions include reporting
and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and
prohibitions on transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as
conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit
plan and a party in interest.  ERISA also provides for a scheme of
civil and criminal penalties and enforcement.  Our insurance, asset
management, plan administrative services and other businesses provide services
to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act
as an ERISA fiduciary.  In addition to ERISA regulation of businesses
providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA’s
prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those plans, which may affect
our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be
entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to
party in interest status.


Broker-Dealer,
Securities and Savings and Loan Regulation

In
addition to being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, some of our
separate accounts as well as mutual funds that we sponsor are registered as
investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the shares of
certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some or all states and the
District of Columbia.  We also have several subsidiaries that are
registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Exchange Act”) and are subject to federal and state regulation, including but
not limited to the Financial Industry Regulation Authority’s (“FINRA”) net
capital rules.  In addition, we have several subsidiaries that are
investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940.  Agents and employees registered or associated with any of our
broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination
requirements and regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), FINRA and state securities commissioners.  Regulation also
extends to various LNC entities that employ or control those
individuals.  The SEC and other governmental agencies and
self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the
U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in
censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension and
termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its
employees.

Our U.S.
banking operations are subject to federal and state regulation.  As a
result of its ownership of NCLS, which was approved on January 8, 2009, LNC is
considered to be a savings and loan holding company and, along with NCLS, is
subject to annual examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision of the U.S.
Department of Treasury.  Federal and state banking laws generally
provide that no person may acquire control of LNC, and gain indirect control of
NCLS, without prior regulatory approval.  Generally, beneficial
ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of LNC would be presumed to
constitute control.

Environmental
Considerations

Federal,
state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and
operation of real property.  Inherent in owning and operating real
property are the risk of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any
required clean-up.  Under the laws of certain states, contamination of
a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the
costs of clean-up, which could adversely affect our commercial mortgage
lending.  In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of
an existing mortgage against such property.  In addition, in some
states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), we may be liable, as an “owner” or
“operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of
hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us.  We also risk
environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged to
us.  Federal legislation provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA
liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate,
provided that certain requirements are met.  However, there are
circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to CERCLA
liability.  Application of various other federal and state
environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for
costs associated with environmental hazards.

We
routinely conduct environmental assessments for real estate we acquire for
investment and before taking title through foreclosure to real property
collateralizing mortgages that we hold.  Although unexpected
environmental liabilities can always arise, based on these environmental
assessments and compliance with our internal procedures, we believe that any
costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any
clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

Intellectual
Property

We rely
on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to
establish and protect our intellectual property.  We have implemented
a patent strategy designed to protect innovative aspects of our products and
processes which we believe distinguish us from competitors.  We
currently own four issued U.S. patents and have additional patent
applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office.  Our currently issued U.S. patents will expire between
2015 and 2021.  We intend to continue to file patent applications as
we develop new products, technologies and patentable enhancements.

We regard
our patents as valuable assets and intend to vigorously protect them against
infringement.  However, complex legal and factual determinations and
evolving laws make patent protection uncertain, and while we believe our patents
provide us with a competitive advantage, we cannot be certain that patents will
be issued from any of our pending patent applications or that any issued patents
will have sufficient breadth to offer meaningful protection.  In
addition, our issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated,
circumvented or found unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create
an effective competitive barrier.  We have in the past instituted
litigation against competitors to enforce our intellectual property rights with
success.  For example, during 2009 we won a $13 million judgment that
upheld the validity of one of our patents and found infringement by the
defendants.  We are currently reviewing the judgment and its
applicability in relation to other potentially infringing parties.


Finally,
we have an extensive portfolio of trademarks and service marks that we consider
important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among
others, the trademarks of the Lincoln National and Lincoln Financial names, the
Lincoln silhouette logo and the combination of these marks.  Trademark
registrations may be renewed indefinitely subject to continued use and
registration requirements.  We regard our trademarks as valuable
assets in marketing our products and services and protect them against
infringement.

EMPLOYEES

As of
December 31, 2009, we had a total of 8,208 employees.  In addition, we
had a total of 1,331 planners and agents who had active sales contracts with one
of our insurance subsidiaries.  None of our employees are represented
by a labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining
agreements.  We consider our employee relations to be
good.

AVAILABLE
INFORMATION

We file
annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with
the SEC under the Exchange Act.  The public may read and copy any
materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F
Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.  The public may obtain information
on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at
1-800-SEC-0330.  Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that
contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information
regarding issuers, including LNC, that file electronically with the
SEC.  The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at
http://www.sec.gov.

We also

http://www.lincolnfinancial.com, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those
reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material

Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

You
should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our
securities.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the
only ones facing our company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not
presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our
business operations.  If any of these risks actually occur, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
affected.  In that case, the value of our securities could decline
substantially.

Adverse
capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity
needs, access to capital and cost of capital.

The
capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption
for more than twelve months.  During this period, the markets exerted
downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain
issuers.

We need
liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on
our capital stock, to maintain our securities lending activities and to replace
certain maturing liabilities.  Without sufficient liquidity, we will
be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer.  As
a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital
stock of our insurance subsidiaries.  Our ability to meet our
obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt
obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses depends
significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability
of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to
us.  Payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by
our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws and regulations
of their respective jurisdictions, including laws establishing minimum solvency
and liquidity thresholds.  Changes in these laws could constrain the
ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us
in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and
corporate expenses.  For our insurance and other subsidiaries, the
principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums and fees, annuity
considerations and cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets,
consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into
cash.  At the holding company level, sources of liquidity in normal
markets also include a variety of short-term liquid investments and short- and
long-term instruments, including credit facilities, commercial paper and medium-
and long-term debt.

In the
event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek
additional financing.  The availability of additional financing will
depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general
availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall
availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings
and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could
develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if
we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity
decreases due to a market downturn.  Similarly, our access to funds
may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative
actions against us.  See “Item 1. Business – Ratings” for a complete
description of our ratings.  Our internal sources of liquidity may
prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully
obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.

Disruptions,
uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our
access to capital required to operate our business, most significantly our
insurance operations.  Such market conditions may limit our ability to
replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities; satisfy statutory capital
requirements; generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity
needs; and access the capital necessary to grow our business.  As
such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities
than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our
profitability and significantly reduce our financial
flexibility.  Recently, our credit spreads have shown considerable
volatility.  A widening of our credit spreads could increase the
interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may
issue.  Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and
statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions
in the financial markets.

Difficult
conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may
materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and we expect
any recovery to be slow.

Our
results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global
capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around
the world.  The stress experienced by global capital markets that
began in the second half of 2007, substantially increased during the second half
of 2008 and continued through the first part of 2009.  Concerns over
unemployment, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market and
a declining real estate market in the U.S. contributed to increased volatility
and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going
forward.  These events and the reemergence of market upheavals may
have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment
portfolio and are also dependent upon customer behavior.  Our revenues
are likely to decline in such circumstances and our profit margins could
erode.  In addition, in the event of extreme prolonged market events,
such as the global credit crisis, we could incur significant
losses.  For example, for the year ended December 31, 2009, our
earnings were unfavorable affected by realized investment losses and impairments
of intangible assets of $1.1 billion.  Even in the absence of a market
downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market
volatility.


Factors
such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the
volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the
business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability
of our business.  In an economic downturn characterized by higher
unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business
investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and
insurance products could be adversely affected.  In addition, we may
experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of
policies.  Our contract holders may choose to defer paying insurance
premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether.  Adverse
changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Our
participation in the TARP CPP subjects us to additional restrictions, oversight
and costs, and has other potential consequences, which could materially affect
our business, results and prospects.

On July
10, 2009, in connection with the TARP CPP, we issued and sold to the U.S.
Treasury 950,000 shares of Series B preferred stock together with a related
warrant to purchase up to 13,049,451 shares of our common stock at an exercise
price of $10.92 per share, in accordance with the terms of the TARP CPP, for an
aggregate purchase price of $950 million.  Access to TARP CPP was an
important component of our strategy to enhance our capital position and
financial flexibility.  We believe that the amount of our
participation in the TARP CPP offers us the ability to exit the program, if
necessary, to manage the potential material consequences to our businesses from
the potential restrictions, oversight and costs of participation, which include
the following:

·

Our
      acceptance of the TARP CPP funds could cause us to be perceived as having
      greater capital needs and weaker overall financial prospects than those of
      our competitors that have stated that they are not participating in the
      TARP CPP, which could adversely affect our competitive position and
      results;

·

Receipt
      of the TARP CPP funds subjects us to restrictions, oversight and costs
      that may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of
      operations and the price of our common stock.  For example, the
      ARRA and recently promulgated regulations thereunder contain significant
      limitations on the amount and form of bonus, retention and other incentive
      compensation that participants in the TARP CPP may pay to executive
      officers and senior management.  These provisions may adversely
      affect our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key
      personnel.  Other regulatory initiatives applicable to
      participants in federal funding programs may also be forthcoming as the
      U.S. Government continues to address dislocations in the financial
      markets.  Compliance with such current and potential regulation
      and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency
      of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory
      capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an
      efficient manner;

·

Future
      federal statutes may adversely affect the terms of the TARP CPP that are
      applicable to us and the Treasury Department may amend the terms of our
      agreement with them unilaterally if required by future statutes, including
      in a manner materially adverse to
us;

·

Our
      participation in the TARP CPP imposes additional restrictions on our
      ability to increase our common stock dividend.  In particular,
      we would need to obtain the U.S. Treasury’s consent for any increase in
      our current quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share of our common stock, as
      well as any stock repurchase, until the third anniversary of such
      investment unless, prior to such third anniversary, we redeem all of the
      shares of Series B preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury or the U.S.
      Treasury transfers such preferred stock to third parties.  We
      are also unable to repurchase or redeem shares of our common stock or any
      series of preferred stock outstanding unless all accrued and unpaid
      dividends for all past dividend periods on the Series B preferred stock
      issued to the U.S. Treasury are fully paid;
and

·

If
      we do not repurchase the warrant from the U.S. Treasury when we repay the
      investment, the U.S. Treasury will liquidate the warrant, which will
      dilute the ownership interest of our existing holders of common
      stock.


If
our businesses do not perform well and/or their estimated fair values decline or
the price of our common stock does not increase, we may be required to recognize
an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the
deferred income tax asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

Goodwill
represents the excess of the acquisition price incurred to acquire subsidiaries
and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets as of the date of
acquisition.  As of December 31, 2009, we had a total of $3.0 billion
of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $2.2 billion related to
our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment and $440 million related to our
Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment.  We test goodwill at least
annually for indications of value impairment with consideration given to
financial performance and other relevant factors.  In addition,
certain events, including a significant and adverse change in legal factors or
the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator or
unanticipated competition, would cause us to review the carrying amounts of
goodwill for impairment.  Impairment testing is performed based upon
estimates of the fair value of the “reporting unit” to which the goodwill
relates.  The reporting unit is the operating segment or a business
one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is
prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level.  If the
implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is lower than its carrying
amount, goodwill is impaired and written down to its fair value, and a charge is
reported in impairment of intangibles on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss).  For the year ended December 31, 2009, we took total pre-tax
impairment charges of $680 million, primarily related to our annuities
business.

Subsequent
reviews of goodwill could result in additional impairment of goodwill during
2010, and such write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial position, but will not affect the statutory capital
of our insurance subsidiaries.  For more information on goodwill, see
Note 10 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” in the MD&A.

Deferred
income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax
basis of assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets are assessed
periodically by management to determine if they are
realizable.  Factors in management’s determination include the
performance of the business, including the ability to generate capital gains
from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies.  If, based on
available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax
asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with
a corresponding charge to net income.  Such valuation allowance could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
position, but will not affect the statutory capital of our insurance
subsidiaries.

Because
we are a holding company with no direct operations, the inability of our
subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability
to meet our obligations.

We are a
holding company and we have no direct operations.  Our principal asset
is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries.

At the
holding company level, sources of liquidity in normal markets include a variety
of short- and long-term instruments, including credit facilities, commercial
paper and medium- and long-term debt.  However, our ability to meet
our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt
obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase our securities and
pay corporate expenses depends primarily on the ability of our subsidiaries to
pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us.  Under Indiana laws
and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including LNL, our primary
insurance subsidiary, may pay dividends to us without prior approval of the
Commissioner up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the
Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends
paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months exceed the statutory
limitation.  The current Indiana statutory limitation is the greater
of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual
statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from
operations for the prior calendar year.

In
addition, payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our
insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of their respective
jurisdictions requiring that our insurance subsidiaries hold a specified amount
of minimum reserves in order to meet future obligations on their outstanding
policies.  These regulations specify that the minimum reserves shall
be calculated to be sufficient to meet future obligations, after giving
consideration to future required premiums to be received, and are based on
certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of
valuation, which are subject to change.  In order to meet their
claims-paying obligations, our insurance subsidiaries regularly monitor their
reserves to ensure we hold sufficient amounts to cover actual or expected
contract and claims payments.  At times, we may determine that
reserves in excess of the minimum may be needed to ensure
sufficiency.


Changes
in these laws can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or
to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to
meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses.  For example, in
September of 2008, the NAIC adopted a new statutory reserving standard for
variable annuities known as VACARVM, which was effective as of December 31,
2009.  This reserving requirement replaced the previous
statutory reserving practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits,
and any change in reserving practices has the potential to increase or
decrease statutory reserves from previous levels.  Requiring
our insurance subsidiaries to hold additional reserves has the potential to
constrain their ability to pay dividends to the holding company.

Investments
of our insurance subsidiaries support their statutory reserve
liabilities.  As of December 31, 2009, 67% of these investments were
available-for-sale (“AFS”) fixed maturity securities of various holdings, types
and maturities.  These investments are subject to general credit,
liquidity, market and interest rate risks.  Beginning in 2008 and
continuing into 2009, the capital and credit markets experienced an unusually
high degree of volatility.  As a result, the market for fixed income
securities has experienced illiquidity, increased price volatility, credit
downgrade events and increased expected probability of
default.  Securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value
and may be hard to sell, if desired.  These market disruptions have
led to increased impairments of securities in the general accounts of our
insurance subsidiaries, thereby reducing contract holders’ surplus.

The
earnings of our insurance subsidiaries also impact contract holders’
surplus.  Principal sources of earnings are insurance premiums and
fees, annuity considerations and income from our investment portfolio and
assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into
cash.  Recent economic conditions have resulted in lower earnings in
our insurance subsidiaries.  Lower earnings constrain the growth in
our insurance subsidiaries’ capital, and therefore, can constrain the payment of
dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us.

In
addition, the amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as
dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus they hold to maintain their
financial strength ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk
protection and for future investment in our
businesses.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe that our
insurance subsidiaries have sufficient liquidity to meet their contract holder
obligations and maintain their operations.

The
result of the difficult economic and market conditions in reducing the contract
holders’ surplus of our insurance subsidiaries has affected our ability to pay
shareholder dividends and to engage in share repurchases.  We have
taken actions to reduce the holding company’s liquidity needs, including
reducing our quarterly common dividend to $0.01 per share, as well as to
increase the capital of our insurance subsidiaries through our $690 million
common stock offering in June 2009 and participation in the TARP
CPP.  In the event that current resources do not satisfy our current
needs, we may have to seek additional financing, which may not be available or
only available with unfavorable terms and conditions.  For a further
discussion of liquidity, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition –
Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the MD&A.

The
difficulties faced by other financial institutions could adversely affect
us.

We have
exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute
transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including
brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other
institutions.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in
the event of default of our counterparty.  In addition, with respect
to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral
held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to
recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to
it.  We also may have exposure to these financial institutions in the
form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and/or equity
investments.  There can be no assurance that any such losses or
impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and
adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Furthermore,
we distribute a significant amount of our insurance, annuity and mutual fund
products through large financial institutions.  We believe that the
mergers of several of these entities, as well as the negative impact of the
markets on these entities, has disrupted and may lead to further disruption of
their businesses, which may have a negative effect on our production
levels.

Our
participation in a securities lending program and a reverse repurchase program
subjects us to potential liquidity and other risks.

We
participate in a securities lending program for our general account whereby
fixed income securities are loaned by our agent bank to third parties, primarily
major brokerage firms and commercial banks.  The borrowers of our
securities provide us with collateral, typically in cash, which we separately
maintain.  We invest such cash collateral in other securities,
primarily in commercial paper and money market or other short term
funds.  Securities with a fair value of $479 million were on loan
under the program as of December 31, 2009.  Securities loaned under
such transactions may be sold or repledged by the transferee.  We were
liable for cash collateral under our control of $501 million as of December 31,
2009.


We
participate in a reverse repurchase program for our general account whereby we
sell fixed income securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms,
with a concurrent agreement to repurchase those same securities at a determined
future date.  The borrowers of our securities provide us with cash
collateral which is typically invested in fixed maturity
securities.  The fair value of securities pledged under reverse
repurchase agreements was $359 million as of December 31, 2009.

As of
December 31, 2009, substantially all of the securities on loan under the program
could be returned to us by the borrowers at any time.  Collateral
received under the reverse repurchase program cannot be returned prior to
maturity; however, market conditions on the repurchase date may limit our
ability to enter into new agreements.  The return of loaned securities
or our inability to enter into new reverse repurchase agreements would require
us to return the cash collateral associated with such securities.  In
addition, in some cases, the maturity of the securities held as invested
collateral (i.e., securities that we have purchased with cash received from the
third parties) may exceed the term of the related securities and the market
value may fall below the amount of cash received as collateral and
invested.  If we are required to return significant amounts of cash
collateral on short notice and we are forced to sell securities to meet the
return obligation, we may have difficulty selling such collateral that is
invested in securities in a timely manner, and we may be forced to sell
securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would
have been able to realize under normal market conditions, or both.  In
addition, under stressful capital market and economic conditions, such as those
conditions we have experienced in the last twelve months, liquidity broadly
deteriorates, which may further restrict our ability to sell
securities.

Our
reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future
business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may prove to be
inadequate.

We
establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much we
will need to pay for future benefits and claims.  For our insurance
products, we calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and estimates,
including, but not limited to, estimated premiums we will receive over the
assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance
policy, the lapse rate of the policies, the amount of benefits or claims to be
paid and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we
receive.

As part
of our transition plan related to the rescission of a reinsurance treaty
covering disability income business, we conducted a reserve study to determine
the adequacy of the reserves to cover contract holder obligations during the
fourth quarter of 2009.  During the fourth quarter of 2009, we
increased reserves as a result of our review of the adequacy of reserves
supporting this business and wrote off certain receivables related to the
rescission that were deemed to be uncollectible, which resulted in a $33 million
unfavorable effect to net income.

The
sensitivity of our statutory reserves and surplus established for our variable
annuity base contracts and riders to changes in the equity markets will vary
depending on the magnitude of the decline.  The sensitivity will be
affected by the level of account values relative to the level of guaranteed
amounts, product design and reinsurance.  Statutory reserves for
variable annuities depend upon the cumulative equity market impacts on the
business in force, and therefore, result in non-linear relationships with
respect to the level of equity market performance within any reporting
period.

The
assumptions and estimates we use in connection with establishing and carrying
our reserves are inherently uncertain.  Accordingly, we cannot
determine with precision the ultimate amount or the timing of the payment of
actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy
liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or
claims.  If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or
estimates, our reserves may prove to be inadequate in relation to our estimated
future benefits and claims.

Because
the equity markets and other factors impact the profitability and expected
profitability of many of our products, changes in equity markets and other
factors may significantly affect our business and profitability.

The fee
revenue that we earn on equity-based variable annuities and VUL insurance
policies is based upon account values.  Because strong equity markets
result in higher account values, strong equity markets positively affect our net
income through increased fee revenue.  Conversely, a weakening of the
equity markets results in lower fee income and may have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and capital resources.


The
increased fee revenue resulting from strong equity markets increases the
expected gross profits (“EGPs) from variable insurance products as do better
than expected lapses, mortality rates and expenses.  As a result,
higher EGPs may result in lower net amortized costs related to deferred
acquisition costs (“DAC”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), value of business
acquired (“VOBA”), DFEL and changes in future contract
benefits.  However, a decrease in the equity markets, as well as worse
than expected increases in lapses, mortality rates and expenses, depending upon
their significance, may result in higher net amortized costs associated with
DAC, DSI, VOBA, DFEL and changes in future contract benefits and may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital
resources.  For example, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we reset our
baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as
our “reversion to the mean” (“RTM”) process.  As a result of this and
the impact of the volatile capital market conditions on our annuity reserves, we
had a cumulative unfavorable prospective unlocking of $223 million,
after-tax.  If unfavorable economic conditions return, additional
unlocking of our RTM assumptions could be possible in future periods. 
However, if we were to have unlocked our RTM assumption in the corridor as of
December 31, 2009, we would have recorded a favorable prospective unlocking of
approximately $300 million, pre-tax, as a result of improved market conditions
in 2009.  For further information about our RTM process, see “Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in the
MD&A.

Changes
in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affect the profitability
of our products with guaranteed benefits; therefore, such changes may have a
material adverse effect on our business and profitability.

Certain
of our variable annuity products include guaranteed benefit
riders.  These include GDB, GWB and GIB riders.  Our GWB,
GIB and 4LATER® (a form of GIB rider) features have elements of both insurance
benefits accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs
and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”)

Accounting Standards
Codification

TM

(“ASC”) (“benefit reserves”) and embedded derivatives accounted for under the
Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics
of the FASB ASC (“embedded derivative reserves”). The benefit reserves resulting
from a benefit ratio unlocking component are calculated in a manner consistent
with our GDB, as described below.  We calculate the value of the
embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserves based on the specific
characteristics of each guaranteed living benefit feature.  The amount
of reserves related to GDB for variable annuities is tied to the difference
between the value of the underlying accounts and the GDB, calculated using a
benefit ratio approach.  The GDB reserves take into account the
present value of total expected GDB payments, the present value of total
expected GDB assessments over the life of the contract, claims paid to date and
assessments to date.  Reserves for our GIB and certain GWB with
lifetime benefits are based on a combination of fair value of the underlying
benefit and a benefit ratio approach that is based on the projected future
payments in excess of projected future account values.  The benefit
ratio approach takes into account the present value of total expected GIB
payments, the present value of total expected GIB assessments over the life of
the contract, claims paid to date and assessments to date.  The amount
of reserves related to those GWB that do not have lifetime benefits is based on
the fair value of the underlying benefit.

Both the
level of expected payments and expected total assessments used in calculating
the benefit ratio are affected by the equity markets.  The liabilities
related to fair value are impacted by changes in equity markets, interest rates
and volatility.  Accordingly, strong equity markets will decrease the
amount of reserves that we must carry, and strong equity markets, increases in
interest rates and decreases in volatility will generally decrease the reserves
calculated using fair value.  Conversely, a decrease in the equity
markets will increase the expected future payments used in the benefit ratio
approach, which has the effect of increasing the amount of
reserves.  Also, a decrease in the equity market along with a decrease
in interest rates and an increase in volatility will generally result in an
increase in the reserves calculated using fair value, which are the conditions
we have experienced recently.

Increases
in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which the
increase occurs.  Therefore, we maintain a customized dynamic hedge
program that is designed to mitigate the risks associated with income volatility
around the change in reserves on guaranteed benefits.  However, the
hedge positions may not be effective to exactly offset the changes in the
carrying value of the guarantees due to, among other things, the time lag
between changes in their values and corresponding changes in the hedge
positions, high levels of volatility in the equity markets and derivatives
markets, extreme swings in interest rates, contract holder behavior different
than expected, a strategic decision to under- or over-hedge in reaction to
extreme market conditions or inconsistencies between economic and statutory
reserving guidelines and divergence between the performance of the underlying
funds and hedging indices.  For example, for the years ended December
31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we experienced a breakage on our guaranteed living
benefits net derivatives results of $(137) million, $176 million and $(136)
million, respectively, pre-tax and before the associated amortization of DAC,
VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds and funds withheld
reinsurance liabilities.  Breakage is defined as the difference
between the change in the value of the liabilities, excluding the amount related
to the non-performance risk component, and the change in the fair value of the
derivatives.  Breakage can be positive or negative.  The
non-performance risk factor is required under the Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, which requires us to consider our own credit
standing, which is not hedged, in the valuation of certain of these
liabilities.  A decrease in our own credit spread could cause the
value of these liabilities to increase, resulting in a reduction to net
income.  Conversely, an increase in our own credit spread could cause
the value of these liabilities to decrease, resulting in an increase to net
income.


In
addition, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that
derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, and we are also
subject to the risk that the cost of hedging these guaranteed benefits
increases, resulting in a reduction to net income.  These,
individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on net income,
financial condition or liquidity.

Changes
in interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and may result in
increased contract withdrawals.

Because
the profitability of our fixed annuity and interest-sensitive whole life, UL and
fixed portion of defined contribution and VUL insurance business depends in part
on interest rate spreads, interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect our
profitability.  Changes in interest rates may reduce both our
profitability from spread businesses and our return on invested
capital.  Some of our products, principally fixed annuities,
interest-sensitive whole life, UL and the fixed portion of VUL insurance, have
interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in interest
rates will reduce our spread, or the difference between the amounts that we are
required to pay under the contracts and the amounts we are able to earn on our
general account investments intended to support our obligations under the
contracts.  Declines in our spread or instances where the returns on
our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate
guarantees on these products could have a material adverse effect on our
businesses or results of operations.

In
periods of increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the assets
in our general account with higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher
crediting rates necessary to keep our interest-sensitive products
competitive.  We therefore may have to accept a lower spread and thus
lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing
contracts and related assets.  In periods of declining interest rates,
we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on
our investments in lower yielding instruments then
available.  Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities,
commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general account in
order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this
risk.  Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our
fixed rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and since many
of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our
spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.  Increases in
interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance
products.  In periods of increasing interest rates, policy loans and
surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may
increase as contract holders seek to buy products with perceived higher
returns.  This process may lead to a flow of cash out of our
businesses.  These outflows may require investment assets to be sold
at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in
market interest rates, which may result in realized investment
losses.  A sudden demand among consumers to change product types or
withdraw funds could lead us to sell assets at a loss to meet the demand for
funds.

Our
requirements to post collateral or make payments related to declines in market
value of specified assets may adversely affect our liquidity and expose us to
counterparty credit risk.

Many of
our transactions with financial and other institutions, including settling
futures positions, specify the circumstances under which the parties are
required to post collateral.  The amount of collateral we may be
required to post under these agreements may increase under certain
circumstances, which could adversely affect our liquidity.  In
addition, under the terms of some of our transactions, we may be required to
make payments to our counterparties related to any decline in the market value
of the specified assets.

Losses
due to defaults by others could reduce our profitability or negatively affect
the value of our investments.

Third
parties that owe us money, securities or other assets may not pay or perform
their obligations.  These parties include the issuers whose securities
we hold, borrowers under the mortgage loans we make, customers, trading
counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts,
reinsurers and other financial intermediaries.  These parties may
default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity,
downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure, corporate
governance issues or other reasons.  A further downturn in the U.S.
and other economies could result in increased impairments.

Defaults
on our mortgage loans and write downs of mortgage equity may adversely affect
our profitability.

Our
mortgage loans face default risk and are principally collateralized by
commercial properties.  Mortgage loans are stated on our balance sheet
at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount,
deferred fees or expenses, and are net of valuation allowances.  We
establish valuation allowances for estimated impairments as of the balance sheet
date based on information, such as the market value of the underlying real
estate securing the loan, any third party guarantees on the loan balance or any
cross collateral agreements and their impact on expected recovery
rates.  As of December 31, 2009, there were nine impaired mortgage
loans, or less than 1% of total mortgage loans, and eight commercial mortgage
loans that were two or more payments delinquent.  The performance of
our mortgage loan investments, however, may fluctuate in the
future.  In addition, some of our mortgage loan investments have
balloon payment maturities.  An increase in the default rate of our
mortgage loan investments could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.


Further,
any geographic or sector exposure in our mortgage loans may have adverse effects
on our investment portfolios and consequently on our consolidated results of
operations or financial condition.  While we seek to mitigate this
risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have
a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a
greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the
portfolios are exposed.

For
information about our risk of write downs of mortgage equity, see “Consolidated
Investments – Standby Real Estate Equity Commitments” and “Review of
Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Uses of
Capital” in the MD&A.

Our
investments are reflected within our consolidated financial statements utilizing
different accounting bases, and, accordingly, there may be significant
differences between cost and fair value that are not recorded in our
consolidated financial statements.

Our
principal investments are in fixed maturity and equity securities, mortgage
loans on real estate, policy loans, short-term investments, derivative
instruments, limited partnerships and other invested assets.  The
carrying value of such investments is as follows:

·

Fixed
      maturity and equity securities are classified as AFS, except for those
      designated as trading securities, and are reported at their estimated fair
      value.  The difference between the estimated fair value and
      amortized cost of such securities (i.e., unrealized investment gains and
      losses) is recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income
      (loss) (“OCI”), net of adjustments to DAC, contract holder related amounts
      and deferred income taxes;

·

Fixed
      maturity and equity securities designated as trading securities, which in
      certain cases support reinsurance arrangements, are recorded at fair value
      with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in realized
      loss.  However, offsetting the changes to fair value of the
      trading securities are corresponding changes in the fair value of the
      embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance
      arrangement.  In other words, the investment results for the
      trading securities, including gains and losses from sales, are passed
      directly to the reinsurers through the contractual terms of the
      reinsurance arrangements.  However, there are trading securities
      associated with the disability income business for which the reinsurance
      agreement with Swiss Re was rescinded, and therefore, we now retain the
      gains and losses on those
securities;

·

Short-term
      investments include investments with remaining maturities of one year or
      less, but greater than three months, at the time of acquisition and are
      stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair
  value;

·

Mortgage
      loans on real estate are carried at unpaid principal balances, adjusted
      for any unamortized premiums or discounts and deferred fees or expenses,
      net of valuation allowances;

·

Policy
      loans are carried at unpaid principal
balances;

·

Real
      estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests are carried
      using the equity method of accounting;
and

·

Other
      invested assets consist principally of derivatives with positive fair
      values.  Derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in
      fair value reflected in income from non-qualifying derivatives and
      derivatives in fair value hedging relationships.  Derivatives in
      cash flow hedging relationships are reflected as a separate component of
      other comprehensive income or loss.

Investments
not carried at fair value on our consolidated financial statements, principally,
mortgage loans, policy loans and real estate, may have fair values which are
substantially higher or lower than the carrying value reflected on our
consolidated financial statements.  In addition, unrealized losses are
not reflected in net income unless we realize the losses by either selling the
security at below amortized cost or determine that the decline in fair value is
deemed to be other-than-temporary (i.e., impaired).  Each of such
asset classes is regularly evaluated for impairment under the accounting
guidance appropriate to the respective asset class.

Our
valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities may include
methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing
interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may
materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial
condition.

Fixed
maturity, equity and trading securities and short-term investments, which are
reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represented the
majority of our total cash and invested assets.  Pursuant to the Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC, we have categorized
these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the
inputs to the respective valuation technique.  The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs (Level 3).


The
determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market prices is based on
valuation methodologies, securities we deem to be comparable and assumptions
deemed appropriate given the circumstances.  The fair value estimates
are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and
judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and
amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or
counterparty.  Factors considered in estimating fair value include
coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund
requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer and quoted market
prices of comparable securities.  The use of different methodologies
and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value
amounts.

During
periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly
increasing/decreasing or high/low interest rates, rapidly widening credit
spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities
if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less
observable.  There may be certain asset classes that were in active
markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current
financial environment.  In such cases, more securities may fall to
Level 3 and thus require more subjectivity and management
judgment.  As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that
are less observable or require greater estimation, as well as valuation methods
which are more sophisticated or require greater estimation, thereby resulting in
values which may be less than the value at which the investments may be
ultimately sold.  Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit
and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities
as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the
period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly.  Decreases
in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial condition.

Some
of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that have
been experiencing significant market valuation fluctuations.

We hold
certain investments that may lack liquidity, such as privately placed fixed
maturity securities, mortgage loans, policy loans and other limited partnership
interests.  These asset classes represented 24% of the carrying value
of our total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2009.  Even
some of our very high quality assets have been more illiquid as a result of the
recent challenging market conditions.

If we
require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash
requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with our
investment portfolio, derivatives transactions or securities lending activities,
we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner, be forced
to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or
both.

The
reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments, our investments
in the asset classes described in the paragraph above and, at times, our high
quality, generally liquid asset classes, do not necessarily reflect the lowest
current market price for the asset.  If we were forced to sell certain
of our assets in the current market, there can be no assurance that we would be
able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we might be
forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.

We invest
a portion of our invested assets in investment funds, many of which make private
equity investments.  The amount and timing of income from such
investment funds tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the
underlying investments, including private equity investments.  The
timing of distributions from the funds, which depends on particular events
relating to the underlying investments, as well as the funds’ schedules for
making distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult to
predict.  As a result, the amount of income that we record from these
investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter.  Recent
equity and credit market volatility may reduce investment income for these types
of investments.

In
addition, other external factors may cause a drop in value of investments, such
as ratings downgrades on asset classes.  For example, Congress has
proposed legislation to amend the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to permit bankruptcy
courts to modify mortgages on primary residences, including an ability to reduce
outstanding mortgage balances.  Such actions by bankruptcy courts may
impact the ratings and valuation of our residential mortgage-backed investment
securities.

The
determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our
investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of
operations or financial position.

The
determination of the amount of allowances and impairments varies by investment
type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and
inherent risks associated with the respective asset class.  Such
evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information
becomes available.  Management updates its evaluations regularly and
reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations
are revised.  There can be no assurance that our management has
accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in
our financial statements.  Furthermore, additional impairments may
need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future.  Historical
trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.


We
adopted updates to the Investments –

Debt and Equity
Securities Topic

of
the FASB ASC for our debt securities effective January 1, 2009.  This
adoption required that an other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) loss be
separated into the amount representing the decrease in cash flows expected to be
collected, or “credit loss,” which is recognized in earnings, and the amount
related to all other factors, or “noncredit loss,” which is recognized in
OCI.  In addition, the requirement for management to assert that it
has the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery was
replaced by the requirement for management to assert if it either has the intent
to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not the entity will be
required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost
basis.

We
regularly review our AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine
to be other-than-temporary.  For an equity security, if we do not have
the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to
allow for a recovery in value, we conclude that an OTTI has occurred, and the
amortized cost of the equity security is written down to the current fair value,
with a corresponding change to realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated
Statements of Income (Loss).  When assessing our ability and intent to
hold the equity security to recovery, we consider, among other things, the
severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the equity security as
well as the cause of decline, a fundamental analysis of the liquidity, business
prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer.

For a
debt security, if we intend to sell a security or it is more likely than not we
will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost
basis and the fair value of the debt security is below amortized cost, we
conclude than an OTTI has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to
current fair value, with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our
Consolidated Statements of Income.  If we do not intend to sell a debt
security or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt
security before recovery of its amortized cost basis but the present value of
the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the
debt security (referred to as the credit loss), we conclude that an OTTI has
occurred and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value
with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss), as this is also deemed the credit portion of the
OTTI.  The remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded in OCI
to unrealized OTTI on AFS securities on our Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity, as this is considered a noncredit (i.e., recoverable)
impairment.  Net OTTI recognized in net income (loss) was $392
million, $851 million and $261 million, pre-tax, for the years ended December
31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The portion of OTTI recognized
in OCI for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $275 million,
pre-tax.

Related
to our unrealized losses, we establish deferred tax assets for the tax benefit
we may receive in the event that losses are realized.  The realization
of significant realized losses could result in an inability to recover the tax
benefits and may result in the establishment of valuation allowances against our
deferred tax assets.  Realized losses or impairments may have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial
position.

We
will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from
the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve capital adequacy or
net income and stockholders’ equity levels.

As of
December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1.5 billion in principal amount of
capital securities outstanding.  All of the capital securities contain
covenants that require us to make interest payments in accordance with an
alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”) if we determine that one of
the following triggers exists as of the 30th day prior to an interest payment
date, or the “determination date”:

1.  LNL’s
RBC ratio is less than 175% (based on the most recent annual financial statement
filed with the State of Indiana); or

2.  (i)
The sum of our consolidated net income for the four trailing fiscal quarters
ending on the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed
quarter prior to the determination date is zero or negative, and (ii) our
consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding accumulated OCI and any increase in
stockholders’ equity resulting from the issuance of preferred stock during a
quarter), or “adjusted stockholders’ equity,” as of (x) the most recently
completed quarter and (y) the end of the quarter that is two quarters before the
most recently completed quarter, has declined by 10% or more as compared to the
quarter that is ten fiscal quarters prior to the last completed quarter, or the
“benchmark quarter.”

The ACSM
would generally require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy our
obligation to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net
proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common
stock with an exercise price greater than the market price.  We would
have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed, and,
in the case of test 2 above, our adjusted stockholders’ equity amount increased
or declined by less than 10% as compared to the adjusted stockholders’ equity at
the end of the benchmark quarter for each interest payment date as to which
interest payment restrictions were imposed by test 2 above.


If we
were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient
shares of common stock or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would
dilute the current holders of our common stock.  Furthermore, while a
trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may
not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital
stock.  Our failure to pay interest pursuant to the ACSM will not
result in an event of default with respect to the capital securities, nor will a
nonpayment of interest, unless it lasts for ten consecutive years, although such
breaches may result in monetary damages to the holders of the capital
securities.

In recent
quarters, we have triggered the net income test as a result of quarterly
consolidated net losses, and we may continue to trigger the net income test
looking forward to future quarters.  However, our efforts to raise
capital in the form of equity in the second and third quarters of 2009 resulted
in no trigger of the overall stockholders’ equity test looking forward to the
quarters ending March 31, 2010, and June 30, 2010.

The
calculations of RBC, net income (loss) and adjusted stockholders’ equity are
subject to adjustments and the capital securities are subject to additional
terms and conditions as further described in supplemental indentures filed as
exhibits to our Forms 8-K filed on March 13, 2007, May 17, 2006, and April 20,
2006.

A
decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in
a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings.

In any
particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or
decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory
income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is
sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of
additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business
growth, changes in reserving requirements, such as VACARVM and principles based
reserving, our inability to secure capital market solutions to provide reserve
relief, such as issuing letters of credit to support captive reinsurance
structures, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income
and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain
derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, changes in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the NAIC RBC
formulas. The RBC ratio is also affected by the product mix of the in-force book
of business (i.e., the amount of business without guarantees is not subject to
the same level of reserves as the business with guarantees).  Most of
these factors are outside of our control.  Our credit and insurer
financial strength ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus
amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries.  The RBC
ratio of LNL is an important factor in the determination of the credit and
financial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries.  In addition,
rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the
effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold
in order to maintain our current ratings.  In addition, in extreme
scenarios of equity market declines, the amount of additional statutory reserves
that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees may increase at
a rate greater than the rate of change of the markets.  Increases in
reserves reduce the statutory surplus used in calculating our RBC
ratios.  To the extent that our statutory capital resources are deemed
to be insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating
agencies, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private
equity or debt financing, which may be on terms not as favorable as in the
past.  Alternatively, if we were not to raise additional capital in
such a scenario, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so,
our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more
rating agencies.  For more information on risks regarding our ratings,
see “A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our
ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being
surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” below.

A
downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to
market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered
and/or hurt our relationships with creditors.

Nationally
recognized rating agencies rate the financial strength of our principal
insurance subsidiaries and rate our debt.  Ratings are not
recommendations to buy our securities.  Each of the rating agencies
reviews its ratings periodically, and our current ratings may not be maintained
in the future.  In late September and early October of 2008, A.M.
Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P each revised their outlook for the U.S. life
insurance sector from stable to negative.  We believe that the rating
agencies continue to have the life insurance industry on negative outlook
until a sustained recovery in the general economy.

Our
financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet
contract holder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence
in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness.  A
downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance
subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry by
making it more difficult for us to market our products as potential customers
may select companies with higher financial strength ratings and by leading to
increased withdrawals by current customers seeking companies with higher
financial strength ratings.

This
could lead to a decrease in fees as net outflows of assets increase, and
therefore, result in lower fee income.  Furthermore, sales of assets
to meet customer withdrawal demands could also result in losses, depending on
market conditions.  The interest rates we pay on our borrowings are
largely dependent on our credit ratings.  A downgrade of our debt
ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt, including bank lines
of credit, with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and
accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital.


As a
result of raising capital of approximately $2.1 billion in the second and third
quarters of 2009, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and A.M. Best affirmed our debt
ratings and the financial strength ratings of LNL, LLANY and FPP.  Our
ratings outlook remains negative, with the exception of S&P, which revised
its outlook to stable from negative.  All of our ratings and ratings
of our principal insurance subsidiaries are subject to revision or withdrawal at
any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that
our principal insurance subsidiaries or we can maintain these
ratings.  See “Item 1.  Business –

Ratings” for a complete
description of our ratings.

Certain
blocks of our insurance business purchased from third-party insurers under
indemnity reinsurance agreements may require us to place assets in trust, secure
letters of credit or return the business, if the financial strength ratings
and/or capital ratios of certain insurance subsidiaries are not maintained at
specified levels.

Under
certain indemnity reinsurance agreements, one of our insurance subsidiaries,
LLANY, provides 100% indemnity reinsurance for the business assumed, however,
the third-party insurer, or the “cedent,” remains primarily liable on the
underlying insurance business.  Under these types of agreements, as of
December 31, 2009, we held statutory reserves of approximately $3.4
billion.  These indemnity reinsurance arrangements require that our
subsidiary, as the reinsurer, maintain certain insurer financial strength
ratings and capital ratios.  If these ratings or capital ratios are
not maintained, depending upon the reinsurance agreement, the cedent may
recapture the business, or require us to place assets in trust or provide
letters of credit at least equal to the relevant statutory
reserves.  Under the largest indemnity reinsurance arrangement, we
held approximately $2.2 billion of statutory reserves as of December 31,
2009.  LLANY must maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of
at least B+, an S&P financial strength rating of at least BB+ and a Moody’s
financial strength rating of at least Ba1, as well as maintain a RBC ratio of at
least 160% or an S&P capital adequacy ratio of 100%, or the cedent may
recapture the business.  Under two other arrangements, by which we
established approximately $1 billion of statutory reserves, LLANY must maintain
an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least B++, an S&P financial
strength rating of at least BBB- and a Moody’s financial strength rating of at
least Baa3.  One of these arrangements also requires LLANY to maintain
an RBC ratio of at least 185% or an S&P capital adequacy ratio of
115%.  Each of these arrangements may require LLANY to place assets in
trust equal to the relevant statutory reserves.  As of December 31,
2009, LLANY’s RBC ratio exceeded 600%.  See “Item
1.  Business –

Ratings” for a complete
description of our ratings.

If the
cedent recaptured the business, LLANY would be required to release reserves and
transfer assets to the cedent.  Such a recapture could adversely
impact our future profits.  Alternatively, if LLANY established a
security trust for the cedent, the ability to transfer assets out of the trust
could be severely restricted, thus negatively impacting our
liquidity.

Our
businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our
profitability.

Our
insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in
the states in which we do business.  The supervision and regulation
relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial
condition.  The primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is
the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our
investors.  The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed
by state statutes.  These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory
and administrative authority to state insurance departments.  This
system of supervision and regulation covers, among other things:

·

Standards
      of minimum capital requirements and solvency, including RBC
      measurements;

·

Restrictions
      of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their
      affiliates;

·

Restrictions
      on the nature, quality and concentration of
  investments;

·

Restrictions
      on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance
      policies offered by our primary insurance
  operations;

·

Limitations
      on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can
      pay;

·

The
      existence and licensing status of the company under circumstances where it
      is not writing new or renewal
business;

·

Certain
      required methods of accounting;

·

Reserves
      for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;
  and

·

Assignment
      of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of
      funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain
      policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance
      companies.


We may be
unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not
fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the
relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may
change from time to time.  Also, regulatory authorities have
relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and
approvals.  If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or
do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory
authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or
all of our activities or impose substantial fines.  Further, insurance
regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of
supervision, which permit such authorities to supervise the business and
operations of an insurance company.  As of December 31, 2009, no state
insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us any substantial fines or
revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any
state or issued an order of supervision with respect to our insurance
subsidiaries, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations or financial condition.

In
addition, LFN and LFD, as well as our variable annuities and variable life
insurance products, are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC and
FINRA.  LNC, as a savings and loan holding company and NCLS are
subject to regulation and supervision by the Office of Thrift
Supervision.  As a savings and loan holding company, we would also be
subject to the requirement that our activities be financially-related activities
as defined by federal law (which includes insurance
activities).  These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory
agencies and self-regulatory organizations broad administrative powers,
including the power to limit or restrict the subsidiaries from carrying on their
businesses in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and
regulations.  Finally, our radio operations require a license, subject
to periodic renewal, from the Federal Communications Commission to
operate.  While management considers the likelihood of a failure to
renew remote, any station that fails to receive renewal would be forced to cease
operations.

Recently,
there has been an increase in potential federal initiatives that would affect
the insurance industry.  In January 2010, the White House proposed as
a part of its budget proposal a new “financial crisis responsibility fee” on
certain financial institutions as a means to recoup any shortfall in revenues
resulting from the TARP program, so that the program does not add to the federal
budget deficit.  As proposed, the fee would apply to financial
institutions, including bank holding companies, thrift holding companies,
insured depositories, and insurance companies that own one of these entities,
with over $50 billion in assets, regardless of whether the firm participated in
the TARP program.  The fee as proposed is expected to be an assessment
of 15 basis points against a calculated “covered liabilities” amount and would
be in place for a minimum of 10 years.  Details as to the precise
calculation of “covered liabilities” are still unclear.  Further,
legislation implementing this fee will need to be introduced and passed by
Congress before this tax would take effect.  In December 2009, the
House passed H.R. 4173, “The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2009,” a wide-ranging bill that includes a number of reforms.  The
bill includes, among other things, a new harmonized fiduciary standard for
broker-dealers and investment advisers, the creation of the Consumer Financial
Protection Agency, the creation of a pre-funded resolution trust to cover the
costs of winding down certain failing institutions, the creation of the Federal
Insurance Office within the Treasury Department and provisions relating to
executive compensation.  The bill would require financial
institutions, including insurance companies, to contribute funds to the
resolution trust.  The ultimate impact of any of these federal
initiatives on our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources is
currently indeterminable.

Many of
the foregoing regulatory or governmental bodies have the authority to review our
products and business practices and those of our agents and
employees.  In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of our
businesses by these bodies, which has included more extensive examinations,
regular sweep inquiries and more detailed review of disclosure
documents.  These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring
regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices,
or those of our agents or employees, are improper.  These actions can
result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our
business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

Attempts
to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in
whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations.

The Model
Regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as
“Regulation XXX” or “XXX,” requires insurers to establish additional statutory
reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and
UL policies with secondary guarantees.  In addition, Actuarial
Guideline 38 (“AG38”) clarifies the application of XXX with respect to certain
UL insurance policies with secondary guarantees.  Virtually all of our
newly issued term and the great majority of our newly issued UL insurance
products are now affected by XXX and AG38.


As a
result of this regulation, we have established higher statutory reserves for
term and UL insurance products and changed our premium rates for term life
insurance products.  We also have implemented reinsurance and capital
management actions to mitigate the capital impact of XXX and AG38, including the
use of letters of credit to support the reinsurance provided by captive
reinsurance subsidiaries.  In addition, although formal details have
not been provided, we anticipate the rating agencies may require a portion of
these letters of credit to be included in our leverage calculations, which would
pressure our leverage ratios and potentially our ratings.  Therefore,
we cannot provide assurance that there will not be regulatory, rating agency or
other challenges to the actions we have taken to date.  The result of
those potential challenges could require us to increase statutory reserves or
incur higher operating and/or tax costs.  In addition, as a result of
current capital market conditions and disruption in the credit markets, our
ability to secure additional letters of credit or to secure them at current
costs may impact the profitability of term and UL insurance
products.  See “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions –
Life Insurance” in the MD&A for a further discussion of our capital
management in connection with XXX.

In light
of the current downturn in the credit markets and the increased spreads on
asset-backed debt securities, we also cannot provide assurance that we will be
able to continue to implement actions to mitigate the impact of XXX or AG38 on
future sales of term and UL insurance products.  If we are unable to
continue to implement those actions, we may be required to increase statutory
reserves, incur higher operating costs and lower returns on products sold than
we currently anticipate or reduce our sales of these products.  We
also may have to implement measures that may be disruptive to our
business.  For example, because term and UL insurance are particularly
price-sensitive products, any increase in premiums charged on these products in
order to compensate us for the increased statutory reserve requirements or
higher costs of reinsurance may result in a significant loss of volume and
adversely affect our life insurance operations.

Changes
in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies may
adversely affect our financial statements.

Our
financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is
periodically revised and/or expanded.  Accordingly, from time to time
we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance that
are incorporated into the FASB ASC.  It is possible that future
accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current
accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and
that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

For
example, the SEC has proposed that large accelerated filers in the U.S. be
required to report financial results in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board rather than GAAP, beginning with their fiscal year 2014 Annual Reports on
Form 10-K.  The Form 10-K would include audited IFRS financial
statements for the transitional year, as well as the two preceding fiscal
years.  Thus, an issuer adopting IFRS in 2014 would need to file
audited IFRS financial statements for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014 in its
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 2014.  Despite the movement toward
convergence of GAAP and IFRS, IFRS will be a complete change to our accounting
and reporting and converting to IFRS will impose special demands on issuers in
the areas of governance, employee training, internal controls, contract
fulfillment and disclosure.  IFRS will affect how we manage our
business, as it will likely affect other business processes such as design of
compensation plans, product design, etc.

Legal
and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in
financial losses or harm our businesses.

We are,
and in the future may be, subject to legal actions in the ordinary course of our
insurance and investment management operations, both domestically and
internationally.  Pending legal actions include proceedings relating
to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and
proceedings that are typical of the businesses in which we
operate.  Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of
various alleged classes of complainants.  In certain of these matters,
the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including
punitive or exemplary damages.  Substantial legal liability in these
or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material financial effect or
cause significant harm to our reputation, which in turn could materially harm
our business prospects.  For more information on pending material
legal proceedings, see Note 14.


Changes
in U.S. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs and make the
products that we sell less desirable.

Changes
to the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings or court decisions could
increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income.  For
example, on February 1, 2010, the Treasury Department released the “General
Explanations of the Administration’s Fiscal Year 2011 Revenue Proposals”
including proposals which, if enacted, would affect the taxation of life
insurance companies and certain life insurance products.  The
statutory changes contemplated by the Administration’s revenue proposals would,
if enacted into law, change the method used to determine the amount of dividend
income received by a life insurance company on assets held in separate accounts
used to support products, including variable life insurance and variable annuity
contracts, that are eligible for the dividend received deduction.  The
dividend received deduction reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax
and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense
and expected amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of
35%.  Our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009,
included a separate account dividend received deduction benefit of $77
million.  In addition, the proposals would affect the treatment of
COLI policies by limiting the availability of certain interest deductions for
companies that purchase those policies.  If proposals of this type
were enacted, our sale of COLI, variable annuities and variable life products
could be adversely affected and our actual tax expense could increase, reducing
earnings.

Our
enterprise risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to
unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our businesses
or result in losses.

We have
devoted significant resources to develop our enterprise risk management policies
and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the
future.  Nonetheless, our policies and procedures to identify, monitor
and manage risks may not be fully effective.  Many of our methods of
managing risk and exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market
behavior or statistics based on historical models.  As a result, these
methods may not predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater
than the historical measures indicate, such as the risk of pandemics causing a
large number of deaths.  Other risk management methods depend upon the
evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or
other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which
may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly
evaluated.  Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks
requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and
verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and
procedures may not be fully effective.

We
face a risk of non-collectibility of reinsurance, which could materially affect
our results of operations.

We follow
the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance
companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance
subsidiaries (known as “ceding”).  As of December 31, 2009, we ceded
$342.6 billion of life insurance in force to reinsurers for reinsurance
protection.  Although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries
from their primary obligation to pay contract holders for losses insured under
the policies we issue, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to
the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk.  As
of December 31, 2009, we had $6.4 billion of reinsurance receivables from
reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses, for which they are obligated to reimburse
us under our reinsurance contracts.  Of this amount, $3.0 billion
related to the sale of our reinsurance business to Swiss Re in 2001 through an
indemnity reinsurance agreement.  Swiss Re has funded a trust to
support this business.  The balance in the trust changes as a result
of ongoing reinsurance activity and was $1.9 billion as of December 31,
2009.  As a result of Swiss Re’s S&P financial strength rating
dropping below AA-, Swiss Re was required to fund an additional trust to support
this business of approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2009, which was
established during the fourth quarter of 2009.  Furthermore,
approximately $1.3 billion of the Swiss Re treaties are funds withheld
structures where we have a right of offset on assets backing the reinsurance
receivables.

The
balance of the reinsurance is due from a diverse group of
reinsurers.  The collectibility of reinsurance is largely a function
of the solvency of the individual reinsurers.  We perform annual
credit reviews on our reinsurers, focusing on, among other things, financial
capacity, stability, trends and commitment to the reinsurance
business.  We also require assets in trust, letters of credit or other
acceptable collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to
transact business in the applicable jurisdictions.  Despite these
measures, a reinsurer’s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments
under the terms of a reinsurance contract, especially Swiss Re, could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

Significant
adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of, or higher prices for,
reinsurance.

We
reinsure a significant amount of the mortality risk on fully underwritten, newly
issued, individual life insurance contracts.  We regularly review
retention limits for continued appropriateness and they may be changed in the
future.  If we were to experience adverse mortality or morbidity
experience, a significant portion of that would be reimbursed by our
reinsurers.  Prolonged or severe adverse mortality or morbidity
experience could result in increased reinsurance costs, and ultimately,
reinsurers not willing to offer coverage.  If we are unable to
maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection
in amounts that we consider sufficient, we would either have to be willing to
accept an increase in our net exposures or revise our pricing to reflect higher
reinsurance premiums.  If this were to occur, we may be exposed to
reduced profitability and cash flow strain or we may not be able to price new
business at competitive rates.


Catastrophes
may adversely impact liabilities for contract holder claims and the availability
of reinsurance.

Our
insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as
a pandemic, an act of terrorism, natural disaster or other event that causes a
large number of deaths or injuries.  Significant influenza pandemics
have occurred three times in the last century, but the likelihood, timing or
severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted.  Additionally, the
impact of climate change could cause changes in weather patterns, resulting in
more severe and more frequent natural disasters such as forest fires,
hurricanes, tornados, floods and storm surges.  In our group insurance
operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our
group insurance customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or
morbidity claims.  These events could cause a material adverse effect
on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity,
could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

The
extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of
insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the
event.  Pandemics, natural disasters and man-made catastrophes,
including terrorism, may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially
those that are heavily populated.  Claims resulting from natural or
man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial
results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our
profitability or harm our financial condition.  Also, catastrophic
events could harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase
the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries.  Accordingly,
our ability to write new business could also be affected.

Consistent
with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for
claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses
arising from the event.  We cannot be certain that the liabilities we
have established or applicable reinsurance will be adequate to cover actual
claim liabilities, and a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Competition
for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the
highly skilled people we need to support our business.

Our
success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key
people.  Intense competition exists for the key employees with
demonstrated ability, and we may be unable to hire or retain such employees,
particularly in light of compensation restrictions that will be applicable to us
in connection with our participation in the TARP CPP.  The unexpected
loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material
adverse effect on our operations due to their skills, knowledge of our business,
their years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly
finding qualified replacement employees.  We compete with other
financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products, compensation,
support services and financial position.  Sales in our businesses and
our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key employees,
including financial advisors, wholesalers and other employees, as well as
independent distributors of our products.

Our
sales representatives are not captive and may sell products of our
competitors.

We sell
our annuity and life insurance products through independent sales
representatives.  These representatives are not captive, which means
they may also sell our competitors’ products.  If our competitors
offer products that are more attractive than ours, or pay higher commission
rates to the sales representatives than we do, these representatives may
concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors’ products instead of
ours.

We
may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to
infringement claims.

We rely
on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and
trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual
property.  Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our
intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our
intellectual property.  We may have to litigate to enforce and protect
our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine
their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of
resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove
successful.  Additionally, complex legal and factual
determinations and evolving laws and court interpretations make the
scope of protection afforded our intellectual property uncertain,
particularly in relation to our patents.  While we believe our
patents provide us with a competitive advantage, we cannot be certain that any
issued patents will be interpreted with sufficient breadth to offer
meaningful protection.  In addition, our issued patents may be successfully
challenged, invalidated, circumvented or found unenforceable so that our patent
rights would not create an effective competitive barrier.  The loss of
intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the
protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse
effect on our business and our ability to compete.


We also
may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our
operations or activities infringe upon another party’s intellectual property
rights.  Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents
that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or
services.  Any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of
infringement against us.  We may also be subject to claims by third
parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage
rights.  Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in
significant liability for damages.  If we were found to have infringed
a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur
substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from
providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and
benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade
secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly
licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Intense
competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our
profitability.

Our
businesses are intensely competitive.  We compete based on a number of
factors, including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice,
investment performance, product features, price, perceived financial strength
and claims-paying and credit ratings.  Our competitors include
insurers, broker-dealers, financial advisors, asset managers and other financial
institutions.  A number of our business units face competitors that
have greater market share, offer a broader range of products or have higher
financial strength or credit ratings than we do.

In recent
years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies
in the financial services industry resulting in increased competition from
large, well-capitalized financial services firms.  Many of these firms
also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or
contractual arrangements.  Furthermore, larger competitors may have
lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining
their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products
more competitively.  We expect consolidation to continue and perhaps
accelerate in the future, thereby increasing competitive pressure on
us.

Anti-takeover
provisions could delay, deter or prevent our change in control, even if the
change in control would be beneficial to LNC shareholders.

We are an
Indiana corporation subject to Indiana state law.  Certain provisions
of Indiana law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in
control events affecting us.  Also, provisions in our articles of
incorporation, bylaws and other agreements to which we are a party could delay,
deter or prevent our change in control, even if a change in control would be
beneficial to shareholders.  In addition, under Indiana law, directors
may, in considering the best interests of a corporation, consider the effects of
any action on shareholders, employees, suppliers and customers of the
corporation and the communities in which offices and other facilities are
located, and other factors the directors consider pertinent.  One
statutory provision prohibits, except under specified circumstances, LNC from
engaging in any business combination with any shareholder who owns 10% or more
of our common stock (which shareholder, under the statute, would be considered
an “interested shareholder”) for a period of five years following the time that
such shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless such business
combination is approved by the board of directors prior to such person becoming
an interested shareholder.  In addition, our articles of incorporation
contain a provision requiring holders of at least three-fourths of our voting
shares then outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting
together, to approve a transaction with an interested shareholder rather than
the simple majority required under Indiana law.

In
addition to the anti-takeover provisions of Indiana law, there are other factors
that may delay, deter or prevent our change in control.  As an
insurance holding company, we are regulated as an insurance holding company and
are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our
insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled.  The insurance holding
company acts and regulations restrict the ability of any person to obtain
control of an insurance company without prior regulatory
approval.  Under those statutes and regulations, without such approval
(or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic
insurance company, or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance
company, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such
transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company or
insurance company.  “Control” is generally defined as the direct or
indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies
of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or
controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another
person.  Similarly, as a result of our ownership of NCLS, LNC is
considered to be a savings and loan holding company.  Federal banking
laws generally provide that no person may acquire control of LNC, and gain
indirect control of NCLS without prior regulatory
approval.  Generally, beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the
voting securities of LNC would be presumed to constitute control.

Market and Dividend Information

Our
common stock is traded on the New York and Chicago stock exchanges under the
symbol LNC.  As of January 29, 2010, the number of shareholders of
record of our common stock was 11,183.  The dividend on our common
stock is declared each quarter by our Board of Directors if we are eligible to
pay dividends and the Board determines that we will pay dividends.  In
determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as our
financial condition, including current and expected earnings, projected cash
flows and anticipated financing needs.  For potential restrictions on
our ability to pay dividends, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition –
Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21 in the
accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in Item
8.  The following table presents the high and low prices for our

Purchases of Equity Securities

The
following table summarizes our stock repurchases during the quarter ended
December 31, 2009 (dollars in millions, except per share data):

(1)

Of
      the total number of shares purchased, no shares were received in
      connection with the exercise of stock options and related taxes and 11,190
      shares were withheld for taxes on the vesting of restricted
      stock.  For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, there were no
      shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or
      programs.


(2)

On
      February 23, 2007, our Board approved a $2 billion increase to our
      existing securities repurchase authorization, bringing the total
      authorization at that time to $2.6 billion.  At December 31,
      2009, our security repurchase authorization was $1.2
      billion.  The security repurchase authorization does not have an
      expiration date.  However, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we
      announced a suspension of share repurchased under this
      program.  The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on
      key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free
      cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with
      alternative uses of capital.  The shares repurchased in
      connection with the awards described in footnote (1) are not included in
      our security repurchase.  As required under the Troubled Asset
      Relief Program Capital Purchase Program, repurchases of the Company’s
      outstanding preferred and common stock are subject to certain restrictions
      (unless the U.S. Treasury consents).  In addition to these
      restrictions, in connection with this arrangement, the Company will comply
      with enhanced compensation restrictions for certain executives and
      employees.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

The
following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help
the reader understand the financial condition as of December 31, 2009, compared
with December 31, 2008, and the results of operations in 2009 and 2008, compared
with the immediately preceding year of Lincoln National Corporation and its
consolidated subsidiaries.  Unless otherwise stated or the context
otherwise requires, “LNC,” “Lincoln,” “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refers to
Lincoln National Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  The
MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the
consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Part II – Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” as well as “Part I – Item 1A. Risk
Factors” above.

See Note
2 for a detailed discussion of how the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”)

Accounting Standards

Codification

TM

(“ASC”) is now the single source of authoritative United States of
America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) recognized by the
FASB.  Accordingly, we have revised all references to GAAP accounting
standards in this filing to reflect the appropriate references in the new FASB
ASC.

In this
report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we
also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations
because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the
profitability of our operating segments.  Income (loss) from
operations is net income recorded in accordance with GAAP excluding the
after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:

·

Realized
      gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized
      loss”):

§

Sales
      or disposals of securities;

§

Impairments
      of securities;

§

Change
      in the fair value of embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance
      arrangements and the change in the fair value of our trading
      securities;

§

Change
      in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our guaranteed death
      benefit (“GDB”) riders within our variable annuities, which is referred to
      as “GDB derivatives results”;

§

Change
      in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living
      benefit (“GLB”) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under
      the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and
      Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“embedded derivative reserves”), net
      of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the
      changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred
      to as “GLB net derivative results”;
and

§

Changes
      in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index
      call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index
      allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity
      products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair
      Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“indexed
      annuity forward-starting option”).

·

Change
      in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim
      Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC
      resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders (“benefit
      ratio unlocking”);

·

Income
      (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting
    standards;

·

Income
      (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold
      through reinsurance;

·

Gain
      (loss) on early extinguishment of
debt;

·

Losses
      from the impairment of intangible assets;
and

·

Income
      (loss) from discontinued
operations.

Income
(loss) from operations available to common stockholders is net income (loss)
available to common stockholders (used in the calculation of earnings (loss) per
share) in accordance with GAAP, excluding the after-tax effects of the items
above and any acceleration of our Series B preferred stock discount as a result
of repayment prior to five years from the date of issuance.

Operating
revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following
items, as applicable:

·

Excluded
      realized loss;

·

Amortization
      of deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) arising from changes in GDB and GLB
      benefit ratio unlocking;

·

Amortization
      of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold
      through reinsurance; and

·

Revenue
      adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting
      standards.


Operating
revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance
measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our
segments.  Accordingly, we report operating revenues and income (loss)
from operations by segment in Note 23.  Our management and Board of
Directors believe that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations
explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a
better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because
the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current
operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in
many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the
operations of the individual segments.  In addition, we believe that
our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will
provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it
better reveals trends in our business.

We use
our prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 35% while taking into
account any permanent differences for events recognized differently in our
financial statements and federal income tax returns when reconciling our
non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Operating
revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net
income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of
operations.

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial
information.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

–

CAUTIONARY
LANGUAGE

Certain
statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by
us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).  A
forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and,
without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate
or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words
like:  “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,”
“will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection
with a discussion of future operating or financial performance.  In
particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our
businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial
results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal
proceedings.  We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for
forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.

Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to
differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking
statements.  Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to
vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking
statements, include, among others:

·

Deterioration
      in general economic and business conditions, both domestic and foreign,
      that may affect foreign exchange rates, premium levels, claims experience,
      the level of pension benefit costs and funding and investment
      results;

·

Economic
      declines and credit market illiquidity could cause us to realize
      additional impairments on investments and certain intangible assets,
      including goodwill and a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets,
      which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and
      ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it
      matures;

·

Uncertainty
      about the impact of existing or new stimulus legislation on the
      economy;

·

The
      cost and other consequences of our participation in the Capital Purchase
      Program (“CPP”), including the impact of existing regulation and future
      regulations to which we may become
subject;

·

Legislative,
      regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect the cost
      of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of
      reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct
      business, including changes to statutory reserves and/or risk-based
      capital (“RBC”) requirements related to secondary guarantees under
      universal life and variable annuity products such as Actuarial Guideline
      (“AG”) 43 (“AG43,” also known as Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation
      Method for Variable Annuities or “VACARVM”); restrictions on revenue
      sharing and 12b-1 payments; and the potential for U.S. Federal tax
      reform;

·

The
      initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome
      of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as:  adverse
      actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses
      in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including,
      but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and
      extra-contractual and class action damage cases; new decisions that result
      in changes in law; and unexpected trial court
  rulings;

·

Changes
      in interest rates causing a reduction of investment income, the margins of
      our subsidiaries’ fixed annuity and life insurance businesses and demand
      for their products;

·

A
      decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our
      subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our
      subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an
      acceleration of amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value
      of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and DFEL
      and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of
      our subsidiaries’ variable annuity
products;

·

Ineffectiveness
      of our various hedging strategies used to offset the impact of changes in
      the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the
      equity markets and interest rates;


·

A
      deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality,
      morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions
      used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related
      insurance reserves and in the amortization of intangibles that may cause
      an increase in reserves and/or a reduction in assets, resulting in a
      corresponding decrease in net
income;

·

Changes
      in GAAP that may result in unanticipated changes to our net
      income;

·

Lowering
      of one or more of LNC’s debt ratings issued by nationally recognized
      statistical rating organizations and the adverse impact such action may
      have on LNC’s ability to raise capital and on its liquidity and financial
      condition;

·

Lowering
      of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance
      subsidiaries and the adverse impact such action may have on the premium
      writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries
      and liquidity;

·

Significant
      credit, accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may
      adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios
      requiring that we realize losses on such
  investments;

·

The
      impact of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product
      withdrawals and other unusual items, including our ability to integrate
      acquisitions and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from
      acquisitions;

·

The
      adequacy and collectibility of reinsurance that we have
      purchased;

·

Acts
      of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes
      that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of
      reinsurance;

·

Competitive
      conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the
      emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and
      fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their
  products;

·

INTRODUCTION

Executive
Summary

We are a
holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses
through subsidiary companies.  Through our business segments, we sell
a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products
and solutions.  These products include fixed and indexed annuities,
variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life
insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance and mutual
funds.

We
provide products and services in two operating businesses and report results
through four business segments as follows:

Business

      Segments

Retirement
      Solutions

Annuities

Defined
      Contribution

Insurance
      Solutions

Life
      Insurance

Group
      Protection


Our
individual products and services and defined contribution plans are distributed
primarily through consultants, brokers, planners, agents and other
intermediaries with sales and marketing support provided by approximately 540
wholesalers within Lincoln Financial Distributors (“LFD”), our wholesaling
distributor.  Our Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment
distributes its products and services primarily through employee benefit
brokers, third party administrators (“TPAs”) and other employee benefit firms
with sales support provided by its group and retirement sales
specialists.  Our retail distributor, Lincoln Financial Network,
offers proprietary and non-proprietary products and advisory services through a
national network of approximately 7,700 active producers who placed business
with us within the last twelve months.

These
operating businesses and their segments are described in “Part I

–

Item 1. Business”
above.

We also
have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are
not directly related to the business segments.  Other Operations also
includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance
subsidiaries; investments in media properties and other corporate investments;
benefit plan net assets; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance
related to the sale of reinsurance to Swiss Re in 2001; the results of certain
disability income business due to the rescission of a reinsurance agreement with
Swiss Re; our run-off Institutional Pension business; and external
debt.

Our
former Lincoln UK and Investment Management segments are reported in
discontinued operations for all periods presented.  See “Acquisitions
and Dispositions” and Note 3 below for more information.

For
information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of
operations by segment below.

Current
Market Conditions

Subsequent
to the first quarter of 2009, the capital and credit markets improved following
a period of extreme volatility and disruption that affected both equity market
returns and interest rates.  During this period, credit spreads
widened across asset classes and reduced liquidity in the credit
markets.  The price of our common stock increased during 2009 to close
at $24.88 on December 31, 2009, as compared to $18.84 on December 31, 2008,
after having traded at a low of $4.90 during the first quarter of
2009.  Analysts and economists noted in January 2009 that the U.S.
economy lost more jobs in 2008 than in any year subsequent to World War II and
projected that the economic recovery might take longer than previously
expected.  We also experienced a series of ratings downgrades
primarily from February 2009 to May 2009 as depressed capital markets continued
to strain our liquidity as we prepared to fund debt maturities in the second
quarter of 2009; however, during June of 2009 and following the announcement
about our planned capital actions discussed below, all four of the major
independent rating agencies affirmed our financial strength ratings, and
Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) improved its outlook on our company to stable
from negative.  For more information about ratings, see “Part I – Item
1. Business – Ratings.”

Although
market conditions have improved, we expect earnings will continue to be
unfavorably impacted by the prior significant decline in the equity
markets.  Due to these challenges, the capital markets had a
significant effect on our segment income (loss) from operations and consolidated
net loss during 2009.  In the face of these capital market challenges,
we continue to focus on building our businesses through these difficult markets
and beyond by developing and introducing high quality products, expanding
distribution in new and existing key accounts and channels and targeting market
segments that have high growth potential while maintaining a disciplined
approach to managing our expenses.  During 2009, we experienced
modestly lower deposits but significantly higher net flows than in
2008.


The
markets have primarily impacted the following areas:

Adequacy
of Our Liquidity and Capital Positions

The
continued adequacy of our capital resources to meet requirements of our
businesses and our holding company depends upon such factors as market
conditions and our ability to access sources of liquidity.  In
addition, market volatility impacts the level of capital required to support our
businesses.

Given
this dynamic and challenging environment that began in the fourth quarter of
2008, we have taken the following measures to prudently and actively manage our
liquidity and capital positions as discussed below in “Review of Consolidated
Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources”:

·

We
      reduced our dividend in October 2008 from $0.415 to $0.21 per share, and
      we further reduced the dividend in February 2009 from $0.21 to $0.01 per
      share, which, along with the prior reduction, increased our cash flow by
      $400 million annually.

·

We
      launched an expense reduction initiative in December 2008 that was
      intended primarily to adjust capacity of volume-sensitive areas to the
      reduction in volumes we were experiencing related to the challenging
      economic environment and to improve efficiencies across the entire
      organization.  We completed this initiative in June 2009 and
      achieved an annualized gross general and administrative expense reduction
      that will improve our capital position by $140 million to $160 million
      annually, after-tax.

·

We
      suspended any further stock repurchase activity in October
      2008.

·

We
      issued $690 million of common stock and $500 million of senior notes
      during the second quarter of 2009.

·

We
      issued $950 million of preferred stock and a common stock warrant through
      the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) CPP in the
      third quarter of 2009, as discussed below in “TARP
  CPP.”

·

We
      also issued $300 million of senior notes during the fourth quarter of
      2009, of which most of the proceeds will be used to pay the maturity of
      the $250 million floating rate senior note due on March 12,
      2010.

·

We
      completed the sale of the Lincoln UK in October 2009 for proceeds of $307
      million, after-tax, subject to customary post-closing
      adjustments.

·

We
      completed the sale of Delaware, our investment management operation, in
      January 2010 for proceeds of approximately $405 million, after-tax,
      subject to customary post-closing
adjustments.

Earnings
from Account Values

Our
asset-gathering segments – Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement
Solutions – Defined Contribution – are the most sensitive to the equity
markets.  We discuss the earnings impact of the equity markets on
account values and the related asset-based earnings below in “Part II – Item
7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk –
Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.”  From the
end of 2008 to December 31, 2009, our account values were up $23.2 billion
driven by strong deposits, positive net flows and recent improvements in the
equity markets.  While our ending variable account values as of
December 31, 2009, were modestly higher than as of December 31, 2008, the daily
average account values were much lower than the corresponding period in the
prior year, consistent with the reduction in our asset-based
earnings.  Accordingly, we may continue to report lower asset-based
fees and higher DAC and VOBA amortization relative to expectations or prior
periods.

Investment
Income on Alternative Investments

We
believe that overall market conditions in both the equity and credit markets
caused our alternative investments portfolio, which consists primarily of hedge
funds and various limited partnership investments, to under-perform relative to
our long-term return expectations.  During 2009, the most significant
unfavorable impact from these investments was related to audit adjustments from
the completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of our investees,
determined and recognized during the second quarter of 2009.  The
audit reports that we received for these investees reflected a lower equity
balance than the unaudited financial statements that we used as the basis for
valuation at year end 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.  These
investments impact primarily our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment
and to a lesser extent our other segments.  See “Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates – Investments – Valuation of Alternative Investments” and
“Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” for additional information
on our investment portfolio and further discussion of the nature of the audit
adjustments referred to above.

Variable
Annuity Hedge Program Results

We offer
variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees.  As
described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives –
Guaranteed Living Benefits,” we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure
to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the GLB embedded
derivatives in certain of our variable annuity products.  The change
in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of
the change in embedded derivative reserves.


The
non-performance risk (“NPR”) factors affect the discount rate used in the
calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve.  The NPR factors
are impacted by our holding company’s credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads
adjusted for items, such as the liquidity of our holding company
CDS.  Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within
our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the impact of our insurance
subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and
the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine
factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of
the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance
subsidiaries.  This had an unfavorable effect during 2009 attributable
to narrowing of credit spreads.  These results are excluded from the
Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Defined Contribution segments’ operating
revenues and income from operations.  See “Realized Loss – Operating
Realized Gain – GLB” for information on our methodology for calculating the
NPR.

We also
offer variable products with death benefit guarantees.  As described
below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits
and Other Contract Holder Obligations – Guaranteed Death Benefits,” we use
derivative instruments to attempt to hedge the income statement impact in the
opposite direction of the GDB benefit ratio unlocking for movements in equity
markets.  These results are excluded from income (loss) from
operations.

Variable
Annuity Business Model

In order
to address the realities of the current market conditions in the variable
annuity marketplace, in late January 2009, we introduced changes to our GLB
riders including increased rider fees, reduced roll-up periods and tighter
investment restrictions on new business and a large percentage of in-force
account value.  Increased equity market implied volatility and falling
interest rates have increased the cost of providing GLBs.  The January
product changes reduce benefits provided under the contracts while also
compensating us for increasing costs to provide the benefits.  In
addition, in October 2009, we removed the ability for contract holders to double
their guaranteed amount if held for 10 years without withdrawal or an implied
7.2% roll-up.

Credit
Losses, Impairments and Unrealized Losses

Related
to our investments in fixed income and equity securities, we experienced net
realized losses that reduced net income by $286 million for 2009 and included
credit-related write-downs of securities for other-than-temporary impairments
(“OTTI”) of $255 million.  Although economic conditions have improved,
we expect a continuation of some level of OTTI.  If we were to
experience another period of weakness in the economic environment like we did in
late 2008 and early 2009, it could lead to increased credit defaults, resulting
in additional write-downs of securities for OTTI.

Increased
liquidity in several market segments and improved credit fundamentals (i.e.,
market improvement and narrowing credit spreads) as of December 31, 2009,
compared to December 31, 2008, have resulted in the $4.5 billion decrease in
gross unrealized losses on the available-for-sale (“AFS”) fixed maturity
securities in our general account as of December 31, 2009.

TARP
CPP

On
November 13, 2008, we filed an application to participate in the CPP that was
established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
(“EESA”).  On January 8, 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision
approved our application to become a savings and loan holding company and our
acquisition of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, a federally regulated
savings bank, located in Indiana.  We contributed $10 million to the
capital of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, and closed on the purchase on
January 15, 2009.  On May 8, 2009, the U.S. Treasury granted us
preliminary approval to participate in the CPP.  On July 10, 2009, we
issued, in a private placement, $950 million of Series B preferred stock and a
warrant for 13,049,451 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of
$10.92 per share to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP.  See “Review of
Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of
Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities” for more information about our
preferred stock issuance.

We are
subject to certain restrictions, notably, limits on incentive compensation for
certain executives and employees for the duration of the U.S. Treasury’s
investment.  We are also subject to limits on increasing the dividend
on our common stock and redeeming capital stock (unless the U.S. Treasury
consents), both of which apply until the third anniversary of the U.S.
Treasury’s investment unless we redeem the Series B preferred shares in whole or
the U.S. Treasury transfers all of the Series B preferred stock to third
parties.


Industry
Trends

We
continue to be influenced by a variety of trends that affect the
industry.

Financial
Environment

The level
of long-term interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can have a negative
impact on the demand for and the profitability of spread-based products such as
fixed annuities and UL.  A flat or inverted yield curve and low
long-term interest rates will be a concern if new money rates on corporate bonds
are lower than overall life insurer investment portfolio
yields.  Equity market performance can also impact the profitability
of life insurers, as product demand and fee revenue from variable annuities and
fee revenue from pension products tied to separate account balances often
reflect equity market performance.  A steady economy is important as
it provides for continuing demand for insurance and investment-type
products.  Insurance premium growth, with respect to group life and
disability products, for example, is closely tied to employers’ total payroll
growth.  Additionally, the potential market for these products is
expanded by new business creation.  See “Current Market Conditions”
above for further discussion of the current impact of volatility in the capital
markets.

Economic
Environment

The
National Bureau of Economic Research, a panel of economists charged with
officially designating business cycles, announced that a U.S. recession began in
December of 2007.  While the economy is believed to have rebounded
during the third quarter of 2009, analysts believe that unemployment will remain
high well into 2010, likely restraining consumption.  Analysts do not
expect the labor market to regain the jobs lost during the recession until 2012
or beyond.  The slow recovery of the U.S. economy is likely to result
in businesses and consumers spending less, including on the products the
insurance industry markets and sells.

Demographics

In the
coming decade, a key driver shaping the actions of the insurance industry will
be the escalation of income protection and wealth accumulation goals and needs
of the retiring baby-boomers.  As a result of increasing longevity,
retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to finance retirements that
may span 30 or more years.  Helping the baby-boomers to accumulate
assets for retirement and subsequently to convert these assets into retirement
income represents an opportunity for the insurance industry.

Insurers
are well positioned to address the baby-boomers’ rapidly increasing need for
savings tools and for income protection.  We believe that, among
insurers, those with strong brands, high financial strength ratings and broad
distribution, are best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity to offer
income protection products to baby-boomers.

Moreover,
the insurance industry’s products, and the needs they are designed to address,
are complex.  We believe that individuals approaching retirement age
will need to seek information to plan for and manage their
retirements.  In the workplace, as employees take greater
responsibility for their benefit options and retirement planning, they will need
information about their possible individual needs.  One of the
challenges for the insurance industry will be the delivery of this information
in a cost effective manner.

Competitive
Pressures

The
insurance industry remains highly competitive, especially in this
post-recessionary environment.  The product development and product
life cycles have shortened in many product segments, leading to more intense
competition with respect to product features.  Larger companies have
the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology and risk
management, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in
the life insurance industry.  In addition, several of the industry’s
products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price
competition.  Sufficient scale, financial strength and financial
flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life
insurance industry.  Larger market participants tend to have the
capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information
technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an
increasingly sophisticated industry client base.

Regulatory
Changes

The
insurance industry is regulated at the state level, with some products and
services also subject to federal regulation.  As life insurers
introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine capital
requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance
industry.  Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can
potentially impact the reserve and capital requirements of the
industry.


Issues
and Outlook

Going
into 2010, significant issues include:

·

Potential
      unstable credit markets that can impact our financing alternatives,
      spreads and other-than-temporary securities
  impairments;

·

Potential
      volatile equity markets that have a significant impact on our hedge
      program performance and revenues;

·

Continuation
      of the low interest rate environment, which affects the investment margins
      and reserve levels for many of our products, such as fixed annuities, UL
      and the fixed portion of defined contribution and VUL
      business;

·

Possible
      additional intangible asset impairments, such as goodwill, if the
      financial performance of our reporting units deteriorates, market
      observable transactions of businesses similar to ours occur that imply
      lower market valuations, our market capitalization remains below book
      value for a prolonged period of time or business valuation assumptions
      (such as discount rates and equity market volatility) are adversely
      affected;

·

Achieving
      continued sales success with our portfolio of products, including
      marketplace acceptance of new variable annuity features, as well as
      retaining management and wholesaler talent to maintain our competitive
      position;

·

Maturity
      of credit facilities in the first quarter of 2011 and related letters of
      credit (“LOCs”) that may remain outstanding until the first quarter of
      2012 that support our life insurance business, and evolving treatment of
      reserve financing by rating agencies;
and

·

Continuing
      focus by the government on tax and healthcare reform including potential
      changes in company dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) calculations,
      which may affect the value and profitability of our products and overall
      earnings.

In the
face of these issues and potential issues, we expect to focus on the following
throughout 2010:

·

Increasing
      our product development activities together with identifying future
      product development initiatives, with a focus on further reducing risk
      related to guaranteed benefit riders available with certain variable
      annuity contracts;

·

Making
      targeted strategic investments in our businesses to grow revenues and
      further spur productivity, particularly in Retirement Solutions – Defined
      Contribution and Insurance Solutions – Group Protection, with technology
      upgrades and new products for the voluntary market and an expanded
      distribution focus for our group
business;

·

Managing
      our expenses aggressively through process improvement initiatives combined
      with continued financial discipline and execution excellence throughout
      our operations;

·

Executing
      on financing strategies addressing the statutory reserve strain and
      expiring credit facilities related to our secondary guarantee UL products
      in order to manage our capital position effectively in accordance with our
      pricing guidelines; and

·

Closely
      monitoring our capital and liquidity positions taking into account the
      fragile economic recovery and changing statutory accounting and reserving
      practices.

For
additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and
“Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have
identified the accounting policies below as critical to the understanding of our
results of operations and our financial position.  In applying these
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements, management
must use critical assumptions, estimates and judgments concerning future results
or other developments, including the likelihood, timing or amount of one or more
future events.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
our assumptions, estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and
various other information that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances.  For a detailed discussion of other significant
accounting policies, see Note 1.

DAC,
VOBA, DSI and DFEL

Accounting
for intangible assets requires numerous assumptions, such as estimates of
expected future profitability for our operations and our ability to retain
existing blocks of life and annuity business in force.  Our accounting
policies for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL impact the Retirement Solutions –
Annuities, Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution, Insurance Solutions –
Life Insurance and Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segments.


Acquisition
costs for variable annuity and deferred fixed annuity contracts and UL and VUL
policies are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to the
incidence of estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) derived from the
contracts.  Acquisition costs are those costs that vary with and are
related primarily to new or renewal business.  These costs include
commissions and other expenses that vary with new business
volume.  The costs that we defer are recorded as an asset on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as DAC for products we sold or VOBA for books of
business we acquired.  In addition, we defer costs associated with DSI
and revenues associated with DFEL.  DSI is included within other
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and, when amortized, increases
interest credited and reduces income.  DFEL is a liability included
within other contract holder funds on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and when
amortized, increases product expense charge revenues and income.

EGPs vary
based on a number of sources including policy persistency, mortality, fee
income, investment margins, expense margins and realized gains and losses on
investments, including assumptions about the expected level of credit-related
losses.  Each of these sources of profit is, in turn, driven by other
factors.  For example, assets under management and the spread between
earned and credited rates drive investment margins; net amount at risk (“NAR”)
drives the level of cost of insurance (“COI”) charges and reinsurance
premiums.  The level of separate account assets under management is
driven by changes in the financial markets (equity and bond markets, hereafter
referred to collectively as “equity markets”) and net flows.  Realized
gains and losses on investments include amounts resulting from differences in
the actual level of impairments and the levels assumed in calculating
EGPs.

Our DAC,
VOBA, DSI and DFEL balances (in millions) by business segment as of December 31,
2009, were as follows:

Note:

The
      above table includes acquisition costs associated with whole life and term
      life insurance products and group life and disability policies that
      are amortized over periods of 10 to 30 years for life products and up to
      15 years for group products on either a straight-line basis or as a level
      percent of premium of the related policies depending on the block of
      business.  No DAC is being amortized for fixed and variable
      payout annuities.

On a
quarterly basis, we may record an adjustment to the amounts included within our
Consolidated Balance Sheets for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL with an offsetting
benefit or charge to revenue or expense for the impact of the difference between
future EGPs used in the prior quarter and the emergence of actual and updated
future EGPs in the current quarter (“retrospective unlocking”).  In
addition, in the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive
review of the assumptions and the projection models used for our estimates of
future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and
the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity and life
insurance products with living benefit and death benefit
guarantees.  These assumptions include investment margins, mortality,
retention, rider utilization and maintenance expenses (costs associated with
maintaining records relating to insurance and individual and group annuity
contracts and with the processing of premium collections, deposits, withdrawals
and commissions).  Based on our review, the cumulative balances of
DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are
adjusted with an offsetting benefit or charge to revenue or amortization expense
to reflect such change (“prospective unlocking – assumption
changes”).  We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling
refinements (“prospective unlocking – model refinements”) that result in
increases or decreases to the carrying values of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded
derivatives and reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living
benefit and death benefit guarantees.  The primary distinction between
retrospective and prospective unlocking is that retrospective unlocking is
driven by the difference between actual gross profits compared to EGPs each
period, while prospective unlocking is driven by changes in assumptions or
projection models related to our projections of future EGPs.

In
discussing our results of operations below in this MD&A, we refer to
favorable and unfavorable unlocking.  With respect to DAC, VOBA and
DSI, favorable unlocking refers to a decrease in the amortization expense in the
period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to an increase in the amortization
expense in the period.  With respect to DFEL, favorable unlocking
refers to an increase in the amortization income in the period, whereas
unfavorable unlocking refers to a decrease in the amortization income in the
period.  With respect to the calculations of the embedded derivatives
and reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living benefit and
death benefit guarantees, favorable unlocking refers to a decrease in reserves
in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to an increase in reserves
in the period.


For
illustrative purposes, the following presents the hypothetical impacts to EGPs
and DAC

projections assume, assuming all other factors remain constant:

During
the fourth quarter of 2009, there was a $100 million, after-tax, unfavorable
prospective unlocking due primarily to modifying the valuation of variable
annuity products that have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded
derivative reserves and modifying our fund assumptions with regard to our hedged
indices.

Because
equity market movements have a significant impact on the value of variable
annuity and VUL products and the fees earned on these accounts, EGPs could
increase or decrease with movements in the equity markets; therefore,
significant and sustained changes in equity markets have had and could in the
future have an impact on DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for our variable
annuity, annuity-based 401(k) business and VUL business.  The table
above excludes the impact of our prospective unlocking that we recognized in the
fourth quarter of 2008, which is described below.

As equity
markets do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account
values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our “reversion to the
mean” (“RTM”) process.  Under our RTM process, on each valuation date,
future EGPs are projected using stochastic modeling of a large number of future
equity market scenarios in conjunction with best estimates of lapse rates,
interest rate spreads and mortality to develop a statistical distribution of the
present value of future EGPs for our variable annuity, annuity-based 401(k) and
VUL blocks of business.  Because future equity market returns are
unpredictable, the underlying premise of this process is that best estimate
projections of future EGPs need not be affected by random short-term and
insignificant deviations from expectations in equity market
returns.  However, long-term or significant deviations from expected
equity market returns require a change to best estimate projections of EGPs and
prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in future contract
benefits.  The statistical distribution is designed to identify when
the equity market return deviations from expected returns have become
significant enough to warrant a change of the future equity return EGP
assumption.


The
stochastic modeling performed for our variable annuity blocks of business as
described above is used to develop a range of reasonably possible future
EGPs.  We compare the range of the present value of the future EGPs
from the stochastic modeling to that used in our amortization
model.  A set of intervals around the mean of these scenarios is
utilized to calculate two separate statistical ranges of reasonably possible
EGPs.  These intervals are then compared again to the present value of
the EGPs used in the amortization model.  If the present value of EGP
assumptions utilized for amortization were to exceed the margin of the
reasonable range of statistically calculated EGPs, a revision of the EGPs used
to calculate amortization would occur.  If a revision is deemed
necessary, future EGPs would be re-projected using the current account values at
the end of the period during which the revision occurred along with a revised
long-term annual equity market gross return assumption such that the
re-projected EGPs would be our best estimate of EGPs.

Notwithstanding
these intervals, if a severe decline or advance in equity markets were to occur
or should other circumstances, including contract holder behavior, suggest that
the present value of future EGPs no longer represents our best estimate, we
could determine that a revision of the EGPs is necessary.

Our
practice is not necessarily to unlock immediately after exceeding the first of
the two statistical ranges, but, rather, if we stay between the first and second
statistical range for several quarters, we would likely
unlock.  Additionally, if we exceed the ranges as a result of a
short-term market reaction, we would not necessarily unlock.  However,
if the second statistical range is exceeded for more than one quarter, it is
likely that we would unlock.  While this approach reduces adjustments
to DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL due to short-term equity market fluctuations,
significant changes in the equity markets that extend beyond one or two quarters
could result in a significant favorable or unfavorable unlocking.

Our
long-term equity market growth assumption rate is 9%, which is used in the
determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component
of our variable annuity and VUL products, as this component is related primarily
to underlying investments in equity funds within the separate
accounts.  This variable appreciation rate is before the deduction of
our contract fees.  The actual variable appreciation rate in 2008 was
significantly lower than the assumed rate with October of 2008 representing the
worst returns in 21 years.  The negative returns in the fourth quarter
of 2008 resulted in the piercing of the outer corridor in our Retirement
Solutions businesses and our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance
segment.  Although the piercing of the outer corridor does not
automatically result in a resetting of our RTM assumption, we determined that
the significance of  unfavorable equity markets experienced during
2008 and the recessionary economic environment required a prospective unlocking
related to RTM in the fourth quarter of 2008.  If unfavorable economic
conditions return, additional unlocking of our RTM assumptions could be possible
in future periods.  However, if we were to have unlocked our RTM
assumption in the corridor as of December 31, 2009, we would have recorded a
favorable prospective unlocking of approximately $300 million, pre-tax, as a
result of improved market conditions in 2009.


Details
underlying our fourth quarter 2008 prospective unlocking related to RTM and the
impact of the volatile capital market conditions on our annuity reserves (in
millions) were as follows:

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject
to impairment tests conducted at least annually.  Intangibles that do
not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful
lives.  We are required to perform a two-step test in our evaluation
of the carrying value of goodwill.  In Step 1 of the evaluation, the
fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying
value of the reporting unit.  If the fair value is greater than the
carrying value, then the carrying value of the reporting unit is deemed to be
recoverable, and Step 2 is not required.  If the fair value estimate
is less than the carrying value, it is an indicator that impairment may exist,
and Step 2 is required.  In Step 2, the reporting unit’s goodwill
implied fair value is determined.  The reporting unit’s fair value as
determined in Step 1 is assigned to all of its net assets (recognized and
unrecognized) as if the reporting unit were acquired in a business combination
as of the date of the impairment test.  If the implied fair value of
the reporting unit’s goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is
impaired and written down to its fair value.  Refer to Note 10 of our
consolidated financial statements for goodwill and intangible assets by
reporting unit.


We use
October 1 as the annual date for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment
testing.  However, when factors indicate that impairment may exist, we
would complete an interim test to reassess our conclusions related to goodwill
recoverability.  We performed an interim test of goodwill impairment
as of March 31, 2009, in response to the capital markets crisis experienced in
early 2009.  All of our reporting units passed the Step 1 analysis,
except for our Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit, which required
the completion of a Step 2 analysis.  In our Step 2 analysis, we
estimated the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill.  We
assigned the reporting unit’s fair value determined in Step 1 to all of its net
assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit were acquired in a
business combination as of March 31, 2009.  Based upon our Step 2
analysis, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $600 million for the Retirement
Solutions – Annuities reporting unit that was attributable primarily to higher
discount rates related to higher debt costs and equity market volatility,
deterioration in equity market levels that impacted our variable account values
and lower annuity sales.

Our Step
1 analysis as of March 31, 2009, for our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance
and Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting units utilized primarily a
discounted cash flow valuation technique, although limited available market data
was also considered.  In determining the estimated fair value of these
reporting units, we considered discounted cash flow calculations, the level of
our own share price and assumptions that market participants would make in
valuing these reporting units.  Our fair value estimations were based
primarily on an in-depth analysis of projected future cash flows and relevant
discount rates, which considered market participant inputs (“income
approach”).  The discounted cash flow analysis required us to make
judgments about revenues, earnings projections, capital market assumptions and
discount rates.

The key
assumptions used in the analysis to determine the fair value of these reporting
units as of March 31, 2009, included:

·

New
      business for 10 years and run off of cash flows on in-force and new
      business for the life of the reporting
unit;

·

Expense
      synergies assumption of 25% that would be expected to be realized in a
      market-participant transaction similar to prior market observable
      transactions and prior company
experience;

·

Adjustments
      of several assumptions in our projections to reflect conservatism in the
      near-term as a result of the current volatility in the capital markets,
      including:

§

Lower
      equity market returns for two
years;

§

Lower
      alternative investment income returns for two years;
  and

§

Higher
      costs associated with LOCs related to reserve
    securitizations;

·

Discount
      rates ranging from 11.0% to 16.0% that were based on the weighted average
      cost of capital for each of our reporting units adjusted for the risks
      associated with the operations.  We used 11.0% for our Insurance
      Solutions – Life Insurance reporting unit and 16.0% for our Retirement
      Solutions – Annuities reporting
unit.

For our
other reporting units, we used other available information, including market
data obtained through strategic reviews and other analysis, to support our Step
1 conclusions.

As part
of our annual review process, we performed a Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis
on all of our reporting units as of October 1, 2009.  The Step 1
analysis for our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance and Retirement Solutions –
Annuities reporting units included a roll forward of the estimated fair value of
the reporting units from March 31, 2009.  In this roll forward, we
identified the significant assumptions that impact the estimated fair value,
evaluated how the assumptions had changed since March 31 to October 1 and
quantified the approximate impact to the estimated fair value.  The
key valuation drivers that were evaluated included:  sales
projections, changes in interest rates, changes in equity markets and growth of
business in force or account values.  We also updated our estimates of
discount rates based upon current market observable inputs.  Discount
rates ranging from 10% to 14.5% were used, which were based on the weighted
average cost of capital for each of our reporting units adjusted for the risks
associated with the operations.  We used 10% for our Insurance
Solutions – Life Insurance reporting unit and 14% for our Retirement Solutions –
Annuities reporting unit.  These discount rates reflected improvement
since March 31, 2009, due primarily to significantly lower debt costs and lower
equity risk premiums used as inputs into the discount rate
calculations.

As of
October 1, 2009, the estimated fair value of the reporting units within our
Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses was greater than the
carrying value, and Step 2 was not required.  Subsequent to the
goodwill impairment that we recorded for our Retirement Solutions – Annuities
reporting unit in the first quarter of 2009, there was improvement in the equity
markets that resulted in an increase to our fair value estimate for this
reporting unit.  From March 31, 2009, to October 1, 2009, the
estimated fair value of the Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance reporting unit
was favorably impacted by lower discount rates and, to a lesser extent, the
continued improvement in the equity markets, partially offset by a lower base of
sales related to the temporary decline in sales experienced in early 2009 during
the capital markets crisis.


We also
completed a Step 1 and Step 2 analysis for our Media reporting unit as of
October 1, 2009, as a result of continued deterioration in the radio
market.  We have recorded several impairments over the past two years
due to declining forecasts for advertising revenues.  Consequently, we
recorded goodwill impairment and Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)
license intangible impairment for our media reporting unit as
follows:

·

$79
      million of goodwill impairment and $30 million of FCC license impairment
      during the fourth quarter of 2009;

·

$81
      million of goodwill impairment and $77 million of FCC license impairment
      during the fourth quarter of 2008;
and

·

$83
      million of goodwill impairment and $56 million of FCC license impairment
      during the second quarter of 2008.

If
current market conditions were to deteriorate to levels experienced during the
end of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, and, in particular, if our share
price were to remain below book value per share for an extended period of time
or deteriorate further, we may need to perform interim goodwill impairment tests
in addition to our annual test as of October 1, 2010.  Subsequent
reviews of goodwill could result in impairment of goodwill during
2010.  Factors that could result in impairment include, but are not
limited to, the following:

·

Prolonged
      period of our book value exceeding our market
    capitalization;

·

Valuations
      of mergers or acquisitions of companies or blocks of business that would
      provide relevant market-based inputs for our impairment assessment that
      could support different conclusions regarding the estimated fair value of
      our reporting units;

·

Deterioration
      in key assumptions used in our income approach estimates of fair value,
      such as higher discount rates from higher stock market volatility,
      widening credit spreads or a further decline in interest
      rates;

·

Lower
      earnings projections due to spread compression, lower account values from
      unfavorable equity markets and significantly lower expectations for future
      sales which would reduce future earnings
  expectations;

·

Higher
      than expected impairments of invested assets;
  and

·

Prolonged
      inability to execute future Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model
      Regulation (“XXX”) or AG38 reinsurance transactions for our life insurance
      business due to unavailability of financing resulting in higher capital
      requirements.

To
illustrate the effect that changes in valuation assumptions could have on our
estimate of our reporting units’ fair values, the following presents the
hypothetical impact to segment implied fair value (in millions, except where
otherwise noted) associated with specified sensitivities:

      unrealized balances included in accumulated other comprehensive
      income.

Investments

Our
primary investments are in fixed maturity securities, including corporate and
government bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities and redeemable preferred
stock, and equity securities, mortgage loans and policy loans.  Our
fixed maturity and equity securities that are classified as available-for-sale
are carried at fair value with the difference from amortized cost included in
stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income.  The difference is net of related DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and
amounts that would be credited to contract holders, if realized, and
taxes.  We also have trading securities that consist of fixed maturity
and equity securities in designated portfolios, some of which support modified
coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance
arrangements.


Investment
Valuation

We
adopted the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC for
all our financial instruments effective January 1, 2008.  For detailed
discussions of the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the fair
value of our financial instruments and a summary of our financial instruments
carried at fair value as of December 31, 2009, see Notes 1, 2 and 22 of this
report.

Subsequent
to the adoption of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB
ASC, we did not make any material changes to the valuation techniques or models
used to determine the fair value of the assets we carry at fair
value.  As part of our on-going valuation process, we assess the
reasonableness of all our valuation techniques or models and make adjustments as
necessary.

Fixed
maturity, equity, trading securities and short-term investments, which are
reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represented the
majority of our total cash and invested assets.  Our measurement of
fair value is based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the
asset or liability, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or
use of an asset or non-performance risk, which would include our own credit
risk.  Our estimate of an exchange price is the price in an orderly
transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the
liability (“exit price”) in the principal market, or the most advantageous
market in the absence of a principal market, for that asset or liability, as
opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or receive a
liability (“entry price”).  Pursuant to the Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, we categorize our financial instruments
carried at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the
priority of inputs to the respective valuation technique.  The
three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined as
follows:

·

Level
      1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in
      active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date, as we
      prohibit “blockage discounts” for large holdings of unrestricted financial
      instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available for an
      identical asset or liability in an active
  market;

·

Level
      2 – inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in
      active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of
      the reporting date, and fair value can be determined through the use of
      models or other valuation methodologies;
and

·

Level
      3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs in
      situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or
      liability, we make estimates and assumptions related to the pricing of the
      asset or liability, including assumptions regarding
  risk.

following summarizes our investments carried at fair value by pricing source and

Represents
      primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute the
      fair values.

The
Level 1 securities primarily consist of certain U.S. Treasury and agency
fixed maturity securities and exchange-traded common stock.

The
Level 2 assets include fixed maturity securities priced principally through
independent pricing services including most U.S.  Treasury and agency
securities as well as the majority of U.S. and foreign corporate securities,
residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities,
state and political subdivision securities, foreign government securities, and
asset-backed securities as well as equity securities, including non-redeemable
preferred stock, priced by independent pricing services.  Management
reviews the valuation methodologies used by the pricing services on an ongoing
basis and ensures that any valuation methodologies are
justified.


Level 3
assets include fixed maturity securities priced principally through independent
broker quotes or market standard valuation methodologies.  This level
consists of less liquid fixed maturity securities with very limited trading
activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the
valuation methodologies including:  U.S. and foreign corporate
securities (including below investment grade private placements);
residential mortgage-backed securities; asset-backed securities; and other fixed
maturity securities such as structured securities.  Equity securities
classified as Level 3 securities consist principally of common stock of
privately held companies and non-redeemable preferred stock where there has been
very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the
inputs to the valuation.  For the categories and associated fair value
of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities classified within Level 3 of
the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, see Notes 1 and
22.

Our
investment securities are valued using market inputs, including benchmark
yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided
markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data.  In
addition, market indicators and industry and economic events are monitored, and
further market data is acquired if certain triggers are met.  Credit
risk is also incorporated and considered in the valuation of our investment
securities as we incorporate the issuer’s credit rating and a risk premium, if
warranted, due to the issuer’s industry and the security’s time to
maturity.  The credit rating is based upon internal and external
analysis of the issuer’s financial strength.  For certain security
types, additional inputs may be used, or some of the inputs described above may
not be applicable.  For broker-quoted only securities, quotes from
market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized to be
market participants.  In order to validate the pricing information and
broker/dealer quotes, we employ, where possible, procedures that include
comparisons with similar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent
sales, discussions with senior business leaders and brokers as well as
observations of general market movements for those asset classes.  The
broker/dealer quotes are non-binding.  Our broker-quoted only
securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.  It is possible that different valuation techniques and
models, other than those described above, could produce materially different
estimates of fair values.

Changes
in our investments carried at fair value and classified within Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy result from changes in market conditions, as well as
changes in our portfolio mix and increases and decreases in fair values as a
result of those classifications.  During 2009, there were no material
changes in investments classified as Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.  For further detail, see Note 22.

See
“Consolidated Investments” below for a summary of our investments in
available-for-sale securities backed by pools of residential
mortgages.

We
adopted updates to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB
ASC, effective January 1, 2009.  The FASB provided additional guidance
on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or
liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for
the asset or liability and additional guidance on circumstances that may
indicate that a transaction is not orderly.

This
guidance does not change the objective of a fair value
measurement.  That is, even when there has been a significant decrease
in market activity for a security, the fair value objective remains the
same.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell the
security in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced liquidation or distressed
sale), between market participants at the measurement date in the current
inactive market (i.e., an “exit price” notion).

The FASB
provided additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level
of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation
to normal market activity for the asset or liability.  The FASB also
provided additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a
transaction is not orderly.  Specifically, the guidance provided
factors that indicate that a market is not active, including:

·

Few
      recent transactions based on volume and level of activity in the market,
      therefore there is not sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
      information on an ongoing basis;

·

Price
      quotations are not based on current
information;

·

Price
      quotations vary substantially either over time or among market
      makers;

·

Indexes
      that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset
      are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent fair
  values;

·

Abnormal,
      or significant increases in, liquidity risk premiums or implied yields for
      quoted prices when compared with reasonable estimates using realistic
      assumptions of credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset
      class;

·

Abnormally
      wide bid-ask spread or significant increases in the bid-ask spread;
      and

·

Little
      information is released publicly.


After
evaluating all factors and considering the significance and relevance of each
factor, the reporting entity shall use its judgment in determining whether there
has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the
asset when the market for that asset is not active.  The factors
should be considered in relation to the normal market activity for the
asset.  As of December 31, 2009, we evaluated the markets that our
securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive.  We will
continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market
conditions.

We use an
internationally recognized pricing service as our primary pricing source, and we
generally do not obtain multiple prices for our financial
instruments.  We generally use prices from the pricing service rather
than broker quotes as we have documentation from the pricing service on the
observable market inputs that they use to determine the prices in contrast
to the broker quotes where we have limited information on the pricing
inputs.

Our
primary third party pricing service has policies and processes to ensure that
they are using objectively verifiable observable market data.  The
pricing service regularly reviews the evaluation inputs for securities covered,
including broker quotes, executed trades and credit information, as
applicable.  If the pricing service determines it does not have
sufficient objectively verifiable information about a security’s valuation, they
discontinue providing a valuation for the security.  The pricing
service regularly publishes and updates a summary of inputs used in their
valuations by major security type.  In addition, we have policies and
procedures in place to review the process that is utilized by the third party
pricing service and the output that is provided to ensure we are in agreement
with the output provided by the pricing service.  On a periodic basis,
we test the pricing for a sample of securities to evaluate the inputs and
assumptions used by the pricing service.  In addition, we perform a
check on prices provided by our primary pricing service to ensure that they are
not stale or unreasonable by reviewing the prices for unusual changes from
period to period based on certain parameters or for lack of change
from one period to the next.  If such anomalies in the pricing are
observed, we verify the price provided by our pricing service with another
pricing source.

As of
December 31, 2009, we only obtained multiple prices for 54 available-for-sale
and trading securities.  These multiple prices were primarily related
to instances where the vendor was providing a price for the first time and we
also received a broker quote.  In these instances, we used the price
from the pricing service due to the higher reliability as discussed
above.

For
certain available-for-sale and trading securities, such as synthetic
convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt
obligations (“CDOs”), we obtain a broker quote when sufficient information, such
as security structure or other market information, is not available to produce
an evaluation.  For broker-quoted only securities, quotes from market
makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized to be market
participants. In order to validate the pricing information and
broker-dealer quotes, we employ, where possible, procedures that include
comparisons with similar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent
sales, discussions with senior business leaders and brokers and observations of
general market movements for those security classes.  For those
securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing
information, we use unobservable inputs in order to measure the fair value of
these securities.  In cases where this information is not available,
such as for privately placed securities, fair value is estimated using an
internal pricing matrix.  This matrix relies on management’s judgment
concerning the discount rate used in calculating expected future cash flows,
credit quality, industry sector performance and expected maturity.

Broker-quoted
securities are adjusted based solely on receipt of updated quotes from market
makers or broker-dealers recognized as market
participants.  Generally, the price for a security on this list is
based on a quote from a single broker or market maker.  As of December
31, 2009, we used broker quotes for 238 securities as our final price source,
representing less than 5% of total securities owned.

Valuation
of Alternative Investments

Recognition
of investment income on alternative investments is delayed due to the
availability of the related financial statements, which are generally obtained
from the partnerships’ general partners, as our venture capital, real estate and
oil and gas portfolios are generally reported to us on a three-month delay, and
our hedge funds are reported to us on a one-month delay.  In addition,
the impact of audit adjustments related to completion of calendar-year financial
statement audits of the investees are typically received during the first or
second quarter of each calendar year.  Accordingly, our investment
income from alternative investments for any calendar year period may not include
the complete impact of the change in the underlying net assets for the
partnership for that calendar year period.

Annually,
typically during the first or second quarter, we obtain audited financial
statements for our alternative investment partnerships for the preceding
calendar year and recognize adjustments to the extent that the audited equity of
the investee differs from the equity used for reporting in prior
quarters.  Recorded audit adjustments impact our investment income on
alternative investments in the period that the adjustments are
recorded.


Write-Downs
for OTTI and Allowance for Losses

We
adopted updates to the Investments

–

Debt and Equity Securities
Topic

of the FASB
ASC for our debt securities effective January 1, 2009, which replaced the
requirement for management to assert that it has the intent and ability to hold
an impaired security until recovery with the requirement for management to
assert if it either has the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely
than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery
of its amortized cost basis.  Under this new accounting guidance, if
management intends to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not the
entity will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its
amortized cost basis, an OTTI shall be recognized in earnings equal to the
entire difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair
value as of the balance sheet date.  If management does not intend to
sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not the entity will be
required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis,
but the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than
the amortized cost basis of the debt security (referred to as the credit loss),
an OTTI is considered to have occurred.  In this instance, the total
OTTI must be bifurcated into the amount related to the credit loss, which is
recognized in earnings, with the remaining amount of the total OTTI attributed
to other factors (referred to as the noncredit portion) recognized as a separate
component in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”).

As a
result of the adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, resulting in
an increase of $102 million to our January 1, 2009, opening balance of retained
earnings with a corresponding decrease to accumulated OCI, to reclassify the
noncredit portion of previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt
securities.  In addition, the amortized cost basis of debt securities
for which a noncredit OTTI loss was previously recognized was increased by $199
million, or the amount of the cumulative effect adjustment, pre-DAC, VOBA, DSI,
DFEL and tax.  The fair value of our debt securities did not change as
a result of the adoption.

We
regularly review our AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine
to be other-than-temporary.  For an equity security, if we do not have
the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to
allow for a recovery in value, we conclude that an OTTI has occurred, and the
amortized cost of the equity security is written down to the current fair value,
with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss).  When assessing our ability and intent to hold the
equity security to recovery, we consider, among other things, the severity and
duration of the decline in fair value of the equity security as well as the
cause of the decline, a fundamental analysis of the liquidity, business
prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer.

For a
debt security, if we intend to sell a security or it is more likely than not we
will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost
basis and the fair value of the debt security is below amortized cost, we
conclude that an OTTI has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to
current fair value, with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).  If we do not intend to sell
a debt security or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a
debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, but the present value
of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of
the debt security (referred to as the credit loss), we conclude that an OTTI has
occurred, and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value
with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss), as this amount is deemed the credit portion of the
OTTI.  The remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded in OCI –
unrealized OTTI on AFS securities on our Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity, as this amount is considered a noncredit (i.e.,
recoverable) impairment.

When
determining our intention regarding the sale of a security, we evaluate facts
and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our
security portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of
securities to capitalize on favorable pricing.  The credit loss on a
security is based upon our estimate of the decrease in expected cash flows or
our best estimate of credit deterioration.

We
recognized an OTTI loss of $434 million during 2009, of which $255 million was
recognized in net income on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) related
to credit losses and $179 million was recognized in OCI on our Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders’ Equity related to noncredit losses,
respectively.  For additional details, see “Consolidated Investments”
below and Notes 2 and 5.

For
certain securitized fixed maturity securities with contractual cash flows,
including asset-backed securities, we use our best estimate of cash flows for
the life of the security to determine whether there is an OTTI of the
security.  In addition, we review for other indicators of impairment
as required by the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB
ASC.

Based on
our evaluation of securities with an unrealized loss as of December 31, 2009, we
do not believe that any additional OTTI, other than those already reflected in
the financial statements, are necessary.  As of December 31, 2009,
there were available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses totaling $2.7
billion, pre-tax, and prior to the impact of DAC, VOBA, DSI and other contract
holder funds.


As the
discussion above indicates, there are risks and uncertainties associated with
determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are
other-than-temporary.  These include subsequent significant changes in
general overall economic conditions, as well as specific business conditions
affecting particular issuers, future financial market effects such as interest
rate spreads, stability of foreign governments and economies, future rating
agency actions and significant accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues
that may adversely affect certain investments.  In addition, there are
often significant estimates and assumptions that we use to estimate the fair
values of securities, including projections of expected future cash flows and
pricing of private securities.  We continually monitor developments
and update underlying assumptions and financial models based upon new
information.

Write-downs
and allowances for losses on select mortgage loans, real estate and other
investments are established when the underlying value of the property is deemed
to be less than the carrying value.  All mortgage loans that are
impaired have an established allowance for credit loss.  Changing
economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage
loans.  Increasing vacancies, declining rents and the like are
incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for
monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase in)
an allowance for credit losses.  In addition, we continue to monitor
the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk.  Areas
of current emphasis are the hotel mortgage loan portfolio and retail, office and
industrial properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt
coverage reduction.  Where warranted, we have established or increased
loss reserves based upon this analysis.

Derivatives

We use
derivative instruments to manage a variety of equity market and interest rate
risks that are inherent in many of our life insurance and annuity
products.  Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and
evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a
variety of assumptions and estimates.  We use derivatives to hedge
equity market risks, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures that are
embedded in our annuity and life insurance product liabilities or investment
portfolios.  Derivatives held as of December 31, 2009, contain
industry standard terms.  Our accounting policies for derivatives and
the potential impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are
discussed in “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.” See Note 6 for additional information on our accounting for
derivatives.

We
measure our derivative instruments at fair value, and as a result of adopting
the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC on January 1,
2008, we decreased income from continuing operations by $16
million.  The impact to revenue is reported in realized loss and such
amount along with the associated federal income taxes is excluded from income
(loss) from operations of our segments.  For a detailed description of
the impact of adoption of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of
the FASB ASC, see Note 2.

Subsequent
to the adoption of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB
ASC, we did not make any material changes to valuation techniques or models used
to determine the fair value of the liabilities we carry at fair
value.  As part of our on-going valuation process, we assess the
reasonableness of all our valuation techniques or models and make adjustments as
necessary.

Our
insurance liabilities that contain embedded derivatives are valued based on a
stochastic projection of scenarios of the embedded derivative fees, benefits and
expenses.  The scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those
we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant and include
assumptions for capital markets, actuarial lapse, benefit utilization,
mortality, risk margin, administrative expenses and a margin for
profit.  In addition, an NPR component is determined at each valuation
date that reflects our risk of not fulfilling the obligations of the underlying
liability.  The spread for the NPR is added to the discount rates used
in determining the fair value from the net cash flows.  We believe
these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market
participant; however, as the related markets develop we will continue to
reassess our assumptions.  It is possible that different valuation
techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair
value.

The
adoption of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC
increased our exposure to earnings fluctuations from period to period due to
volatility of the fair value inputs in the current economic environment,
including the inclusion of the NPR into the calculation of the GLB embedded
derivative liability.  For additional information, see our discussion
in “Realized Loss” below and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.”

The
following summarizes the percentages of our future contract benefits (embedded
derivatives) carried at fair value on a recurring basis by the Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC hierarchy
levels:


Changes
of our future contract benefits carried at fair value and classified within
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy result from changes in market conditions, as
well as changes in mix and increases and decreases in fair values as a result of
those classifications.  During 2009, there were no material changes in
future contract benefits classified as Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.  For more information, see Notes 1 and 22.

Guaranteed
Living Benefits

We have a
dynamic hedging strategy designed to mitigate selected risk and income statement
volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market
implied volatilities associated with the

Lincoln SmartSecurity

®
Advantage guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) feature and our

i4LIFE

® Advantage and 4LATER®
Advantage guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) features that are available in our
variable annuity products.  We modified our hedging strategy during
the fourth quarter of 2009 in anticipation of the adoption of VACARVM as of
December 31, 2009.  We have certain GLB variable annuity products with
GWB and GIB features that are embedded derivatives.  Certain features
of these guarantees, notably our GIB, 4LATER® and

Lincoln Lifetime Income

SM

Advantage

features, have
elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under the Financial Services –
Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of
the FASB ASC (“benefit reserves”) and embedded derivative
reserves.  We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve
and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB
feature.  In addition to mitigating selected risk and income statement
volatility, the hedge program is also focused on a long-term goal of
accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits,
recognizing that such claims are likely to begin no earlier than approximately a
decade in the future.

If we
were to experience unfavorable capital markets as we did late in 2008, then we
would expect greater liabilities associated with the contractual
guarantees.  However, the relationship between the components of the
guarantees, namely, the embedded derivative reserves and the benefit reserves,
is not linear.  As the exposure to net amount at risk increases, the
relative portion of the projected benefits that is accounted for as benefit
reserves increases relative to the portion that is accounted for as embedded
derivative reserves.

The
hedging strategy is designed such that changes in the value of the hedge
contracts move in the opposite direction of changes in GLB embedded derivative
reserves.  This dynamic hedging strategy utilizes options on
U.S.-based equity indices, futures on U.S.-based and international equity
indices and variance swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, as well as interest
rate futures and swaps.  The notional amounts of the underlying hedge
instruments are such that the magnitude of the change in the value of the hedge
instruments due to changes in equity markets, interest rates and implied
volatilities is designed to offset the magnitude of the change in the fair value
of the GLB guarantees caused by those same factors.  As of December
31, 2009, the fair value of the embedded derivative reserve, before adjustment
for the required NPR factors, for GWB, the

i4LIFE

® Advantage GIB and the
4LATER® Advantage GIB were valued at $298 million, $192 million and $153
million, respectively.  See “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain –
GLB” for information on how we determine our NPR.

As part
of our current hedging program, equity market, interest rate and market implied
volatility conditions are monitored on a daily basis.  We rebalance
our hedge positions based upon changes in these factors as
needed.  While we actively manage our hedge positions, these positions
may not completely offset changes in the fair value embedded derivative reserve
caused by movements in these factors due to, among other things, differences in
timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the
hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets, interest rates and market
implied volatilities, realized market volatility, contract holder behavior,
divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging
indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge
instruments or our ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent
with our desired risk and return trade-off.  This hedging strategy is
managed on a combined basis with the hedge for our GDB features.

For more
information on our GDB hedging strategy, see the discussion in “Future Contract
Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations” below.

As of
December 31, 2009, the fair value of our derivative assets, which hedge both our
GLB and GDB features, and including margins generated by futures contracts, was
$1.0 billion.  As of December 31, 2009, the sum of all GLB liabilities
at fair value, excluding the NPR adjustment, and GDB reserves was $713 million,
comprised of $643 million for GLB liabilities and $70 million for the GDB
reserves.  The fair value of the hedge assets exceeded the liabilities
by $327 million.  However, the relationship of hedge assets to the
liabilities for the guarantees may vary in any given reporting period due to
market conditions, hedge performance and/or changes to the hedging
strategy.


Approximately
40% of our variable annuity account values contain a GWB rider as of December
31, 2009.  Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to
potential benefits under the GWB contracts, leading to an increase in our
existing liability for those benefits.  For example, a GWB contract is
“in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the
guaranteed amount.  As of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008,
53% and 91% respectively, of all GWB in-force contracts were “in the money,” and
our exposure to the guaranteed amounts, after reinsurance, as of December 31,
2009, and December 31, 2008, was $2.1 billion and $5.0 billion,
respectively.  Our exposure before reinsurance for these same periods
was $2.4 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.  However, the only
way the GWB contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount
over the account value of the contract is upon death or through a series of
withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage per year of the guaranteed
amount.  If, after the series of withdrawals, the account value is
exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments equal
to the remaining guaranteed amount, and, for our lifetime GWB products, the
annuity payments can continue beyond the guaranteed amount.  The
account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis
resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the guaranteed amount over
account value.

As a
result of these factors, the ultimate amount to be paid by us related to GWB
guarantees is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $2.1
billion, net of reinsurance.  Our fair value estimates of the GWB
liabilities, which are based on detailed models of future cash flows under a
wide range of market-consistent scenarios, reflect a more comprehensive view of
the related factors and represent our best estimate of the present value of
these potential liabilities.  The market-consistent scenarios used
in the determination of the fair value of the GWB liabilities are similar
to those used by an investment bank to value derivatives for which the pricing
is not transparent and the aftermarket is nonexistent or illiquid.  In
our calculation, risk-neutral Monte Carlo simulations resulting in over 10
million scenarios are utilized to value the entire block of
guarantees.  The market-consistent scenario assumptions, at each
valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market
participant.  The market consistent inputs include assumptions for the
capital markets (e.g., implied volatilities, correlation among indices,
risk-free swap curve, etc.), policyholder behavior (e.g., policy lapse, benefit
utilization, mortality, etc.), risk margins, administrative expenses and a
margin for profit.  We believe these assumptions are consistent with
those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related
markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions. It is possible
that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially
different estimate of fair value.

For
information on our GLB hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Loss”
below.

The
following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous impact to
realized loss, which could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity
markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities (in millions) at the
levels indicated in the table and excludes the net cost of operating the hedging
program.  The amounts represent the estimated difference between the
change in the portion of GLB reserves that is calculated on a fair value basis
and the change in the value of the underlying hedge instruments after the
amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and taxes.  These impacts do
not include any estimate of retrospective or prospective unlocking that could
occur, nor do they estimate any change in the NPR component of the GLB reserve
or any estimate of impacts to our GLB benefit ratio unlocking.  These
estimates are based upon the recorded reserves as of January 4, 2010, and the
related hedge instruments in place as of that date.  The effects
presented in the table below are not representative of the aggregate impacts
that could result if a combination of such changes to equity market returns,
interest rates and implied volatilities occurred.

The
following table shows the effect (dollars in millions) of indicated changes in
instantaneous shifts in equity market returns, interest rate scenarios and
market implied volatilities:

The
actual effects of the results illustrated in the two tables above could vary
significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our
control, and consideration should be given to the following:

·

The
      analysis is only valid as of this particular business day due to changing
      market conditions, contract holder activity, hedge positions and other
      factors;

·

The
      analysis assumes instantaneous shifts in the capital market factors and no
      ability to rebalance hedge positions prior to the market
      changes;

·

The
      analysis assumes constant exchange rates and implied dividend
      yields;

·

Assumptions
      regarding shifts in the market factors, such as assuming parallel shifts
      in interest rate and implied volatility term structures, may be overly
      simplistic and not indicative of actual market behavior in stress
      scenarios;

·

It
      is very unlikely that one capital market sector (e.g., equity markets)
      will sustain such a large instantaneous movement without affecting other
      capital market sectors; and

·

The
      analysis assumes that there is no tracking or basis risk between the funds
      and/or indices affecting the GLBs and the instruments utilized to hedge
      these exposures.  Tracking or basis risk in the fourth quarter
      of 2009 increased earnings by $26
million.

S&P
500 Index® (“S&P 500”) Benefits

We also
have in place a hedging program for our indexed annuities and indexed
UL.  These contracts permit the holder to elect a fixed interest rate
return or a return where interest credited to the contracts is linked to the
performance of the S&P 500

.

Contract holders
may elect to rebalance among the various accounts within the product at renewal
dates, either annually or biannually.  At the end of each 1-year or
2-year indexed term we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component by
establishing different caps, spreads or specified rates, subject to contractual
guarantees.  We purchase options that are highly correlated to the
portfolio allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are
economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset
period.  The mark-to-market of the options held generally offsets the
change in value of the embedded derivative within the indexed annuity, both of
which are recorded as a component of realized loss on our Consolidated
Statements of Income (Loss).

The
Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics
of the FASB ASC require that we calculate fair values of index options we may
purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations in future
reset periods.  These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of
the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the
balance sheet, using current market indicators of volatility and interest
rates.  Changes in the fair values of these liabilities are included
as a component of realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss).  For information on our S&P 500 benefits hedging results,
see our discussion in “Realized Loss” below.

Future
Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations

Reserves

Reserves
are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and interest
thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be
sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they
mature.  Establishing adequate reserves for our obligations to
contract holders requires assumptions to be made regarding mortality and
morbidity.  The applicable insurance laws under which insurance
companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to
meet future obligations on their outstanding contracts.  These laws
specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using
certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates, and methods of
valuation.


The
reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated in
accordance with GAAP and differ from those specified by the laws of the various
states and carried in the statutory financial statements of the life insurance
subsidiaries.  These differences arise from the use of mortality and
morbidity tables, interest, persistency and other assumptions that we believe to
be more representative of the expected experience for these contracts than those
required for statutory accounting purposes and from differences in actuarial
reserving methods.

The
assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation
of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable.  If
actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves
should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses.  If
experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be
required.  This would result in a charge to our net income during the
period the increase in reserves occurred.  The key experience
assumptions include mortality rates, policy persistency and interest
rates.  We periodically review our experience and update our policy
reserves for new issues and reserve for all claims incurred, as we believe
appropriate.

Guaranteed
Death Benefits

The
reserves related to the GDB features available in our variable annuity products
are based on the application of a “benefit ratio” (the present value of total
expected benefit payments over the life of the contract divided by the present
value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract) to total
variable annuity assessments received in the period.  The level and
direction of the change in reserves will vary over time based on the emergence
of the benefit ratio and the level of assessments associated with the variable
annuity.

We
utilize a delta hedging strategy for variable annuity products with a GDB
feature, which uses futures on U.S.-based equity market indices to hedge against
movements in equity markets.  The hedging strategy is designed such
that changes in the value of the hedge contracts move in the opposite direction
of equity market driven changes in the reserve for GDB contracts subject to the
hedging strategy.  Because the GDB reserves are based upon projected
long-term equity market return assumptions, and because the value of the hedging
contracts will reflect current capital market conditions, the quarterly changes
in values for the GDB reserves and the hedging contracts may not exactly offset
each other.  Despite these short-term fluctuations in values, we
intend to continue to hedge our long-term GDB exposure in order to mitigate the
risk associated with falling equity markets.  Account balances covered
in this hedging program represent approximately 93% of total account balances
for variable annuities with a guaranteed death benefit other than account value
at time of death.  As of December 31, 2009, the GDB reserves were $70
million.

For
information on our GDB hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Loss”
below.

Deferred
Gain on Sale of the Reinsurance Segment

In 2001,
we sold our reinsurance operation to Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc.
(“Swiss Re”).  The transaction involved a series of indemnity
reinsurance transactions combined with the sale of certain stock companies that
comprised our reinsurance operation.  The gain related to the
indemnity reinsurance transactions was recorded as a deferred gain in the
liability section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The deferred
gain is being amortized into income at the rate that earnings on the reinsured
business are expected to emerge, over a period of 15 years.  In
addition, because we have not been relieved of our legal liabilities to the
underlying ceding companies with respect to the portion of the business
indemnity reinsured by Swiss Re, the reserves for the underlying reinsurance
contracts as well as a corresponding reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re will
continue to be carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets during the run-off
period of the underlying reinsurance business.  This is particularly
relevant in the case of the exited personal accident reinsurance lines of
business where the underlying reserves are based upon various estimates that are
subject to considerable uncertainty.

Because
of ongoing uncertainty related to the personal accident business, the reserves
related to these exited business lines carried on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets as of December 31, 2009, may ultimately prove to be either excessive or
deficient.  For instance, in the event that future developments
indicate that these reserves should be increased, we would record a current
period non-cash charge to record the increase in reserves.  Because
Swiss Re is responsible for paying the underlying claims to the ceding
companies, we would record a corresponding increase in reinsurance recoverable
from Swiss Re.  However, we would not take the full benefit in
earnings for the recording of the increase in the reinsurance recoverable in the
period of the change.  Rather, we would increase the deferred gain
recognized upon the closing of the indemnity reinsurance transaction with Swiss
Re and would report a cumulative amortization “catch-up” adjustment to the
deferred gain balance as increased earnings recognized in the period of
change.  Any amount of additional increase to the deferred gain above
the cumulative amortization “catch-up” adjustment must continue to be deferred
and will be amortized into income in future periods over the remaining period of
expected run-off of the underlying business.  No cash would be
transferred between Swiss Re and us as a result of these
developments.


Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Pursuant
to the accounting rules for our obligations to employees under our various
pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we are required to make a number
of assumptions to estimate related liabilities and expenses.  Our most
significant assumptions are those for the weighted-average discount rate on our
benefit obligation liability and expected return on plan assets.  The
discount rate assumptions are determined using an analysis of current market
information and the projected benefit flows associated with these
plans.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is
initially established at the beginning of the plan year based on historical and
projected future rates of return and is the average rate of earnings expected on
the funds invested or to be invested in the plan.  See Note 1 and Note
18 for more information on our accounting for employee benefit
plans.

The
following presents our estimates of the hypothetical impact to net income (in
millions) for the year ended December 31, 2009, associated with sensitivities
related to these significant assumptions:

Due to
the recent equity market recovery experienced during the second half of 2009,
partially offset by a decrease in our discount rate assumption on benefit
obligations for 2010, we expect the U.S. net periodic pension benefit expense in
2010 will be lower than what was experienced in 2009.  To illustrate
the potential impact, the following provides our actual expense for 2008 and
2009 and our current assumption for expense (in millions) for 2010 by
segment:

We retained
the Lincoln UK pension plan after the sale of this business, and we
expect our related pension expense for 2010 to be approximately $1
million when assuming an average exchange rate of 1.75 pounds sterling to U.S.
dollars, which will be reflected within Other Operations.

See
“Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources –
Uses of Capital – Pension Contributions” below for a discussion of our required
future contributions to our pension plans.

Contingencies

Management
establishes separate reserves for each contingent matter when it is deemed
probable and can be reasonably estimated.  The outcomes of
contingencies, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are
inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for
the estimated settlement are subject to significant changes.  It is
possible that the ultimate cost to LNC, including the tax-deductibility of
payments, could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a
particular quarterly or annual period.  See Note 14 for more
information on our contingencies.


Stock-Based
Incentive Compensation

Determining
the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment, including
estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected
exercise behavior, expected dividend yield and expected
forfeitures.  If any of those assumptions differ significantly from
actual, stock-based compensation expense could be impacted, which could have a
material effect on our consolidated results of operations in a particular
quarterly or annual period.  See Note 20 for more information on our
stock-based incentive compensation plans.

Because
the volatility of our share price has been higher than historical levels in
recent years, the annualized volatility measure that we use to calculate future
stock option values continues to increase, resulting in an increase to the fair
value of option awards granted to employees and directors.

Income
Taxes

Management
uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining the income taxes payable
or refundable for the current year, the deferred income tax liabilities and
assets for items recognized differently in its financial statements from amounts
shown on its income tax returns, and the federal income tax expense. 
Determining these amounts requires analysis and interpretation of current tax
laws and regulations.  Management exercises considerable judgment in
evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax
liabilities and assets.  These judgments and estimates are re-evaluated on
a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change.

The
application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred
tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our
deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be
realizable.  Considerable judgment and the use of estimates are
required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so,
the amount of such valuation allowance.  In evaluating the need for a
valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including:  the nature
and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in
prior carryback years; future reversals of existing temporary differences; the
length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we
would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused.  Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that
the deferred tax assets, including our capital loss deferred tax asset, will be
realized.  For additional information on our income taxes, see Note
7.

Changes
to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, administrative rulings or
court decisions could increase our effective tax rate.  In this
regard, on August 16, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a
revenue ruling that purports, among other things, to modify the calculation of
separate account deduction for dividends received by life insurance
companies.  Subsequently, the IRS issued another revenue ruling that
suspended the August 16 ruling and announced a new regulation project on the
issue.

Acquisitions
and Dispositions

As of
August 18, 2009, LNC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Lincoln National
Investment Companies, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Macquarie
Bank Limited (“MBL”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell to MBL all of the
outstanding capital stock of Delaware Management Holdings, Inc., our former
subsidiary, or “Delaware,” which provides investment products and services to
individuals and institutions.  This transaction closed on January 4,
2010, and we received cash consideration at closing of approximately $405
million, after-tax, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.

The
transaction is expected to be neutral to earnings per share assuming
reinvestment of net proceeds back into core insurance businesses.  We
expect a modest gain on disposal, which will be recorded as of the close of the
transaction.  The actual gain or loss may differ from our expected
result depending upon, among other things, the actual purchase price after
closing adjustments.

On
October 1, 2009, we completed the previously announced sale of the capital stock
of Lincoln National (UK) plc to SLF of Canada UK Limited for proceeds of $307
million, after-tax, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.  We
retained Lincoln UK’s pension plan assets and liabilities.  The
results of Lincoln National (UK) plc and its subsidiaries comprised the former
Lincoln UK segment.  The Lincoln UK segment primarily focused on
providing life and retirement income products in the U.K.  In the
third quarter of 2009, there was a $55 million adjustment to the loss on
disposition of our Lincoln UK segment as a result of finalizing treatment of the
UK pension, refining certain tax estimates and closing out various hedges put in
place at the time of the announcement.

Accordingly,
we have reported the results of these businesses as discontinued operations on
our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and the assets and liabilities as
held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods
presented.


Due to
the sale of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management operations, we expect that
our remaining businesses will have to absorb some overhead costs in 2010 that
were previously allocated to these former businesses.  The following table
provides the estimated unfavorable effect (in millions) to income from
operations by segment:

Comparison
of 2009 to 2008

Net
income decreased due primarily to the following:

·

Impairment
      of goodwill in 2009 of $600 million for Retirement Solutions – Annuities
      due to continued market volatility, the corresponding increase in discount
      rates and lower annuity sales and $109 million impairment of goodwill and
      our FCC license intangible assets related to our remaining radio clusters
      during 2009 attributable primarily to declining results and forecasted
      advertising revenues, compared to a $297 million impairment of goodwill
      and our FCC license intangible assets during 2008 attributable to declines
      in advertising revenues for the entire radio market and impairment of our
      Lincoln UK goodwill due to deterioration in the
  market:

§

See
      “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Goodwill and Other
      Intangible Assets” above for additional information on our goodwill
      impairment; and

§

However,
      these non-cash impairments did not impact our liquidity and will not
      impact our future liquidity;

·

The overall unfavorable GLB net
      derivatives results, excluding unlocking, during 2009, which was due to a
      reduction in the NPR component of the liability that is not included in
      the hedge program attributable to a narrowing of credit spreads, compared
      to favorable GLB net derivatives results during 2008 as the NPR adjustment
      was favorable attributable primarily to widening credit spreads that more
      than offset the unfavorable GLB hedge program performance due to extreme
      market conditions

(see “Realized Loss” below for
      more information on our GLB liability and derivative
      performance);

·

The
      $114 million loss on disposition of our Lincoln UK segment during 2009
      (see “Acquisitions and Dispositions” above and Note 3 for additional
      information on the disposition of our discontinued
      operations);

·

Lower
      earnings from our variable annuity and mutual fund (within our Defined
      Contribution segment) products as a result of declines in the equity
      markets;

·

The
      $64 million unfavorable impact from the rescission of the reinsurance
      agreement on certain disability income business sold to Swiss Re in the
      first quarter of 2009, as discussed in “Reinsurance” below; and
      unfavorable adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2009 to increase
      reserves as a result of our review of the adequacy of reserves
      supporting this business and to write off certain receivables related to
      the rescission; and

·

The
      overall unfavorable GDB derivatives results, excluding unlocking, during
      2009 due primarily to more favorable equity market
      performance.


The
decrease in net income was partially offset by the following:

·

A
      decrease in realized losses on our AFS securities attributable primarily
      to lower OTTI;

·

A
      $125 million unfavorable prospective unlocking (a $119 million decrease
      from assumption changes and a $6 million decrease from model refinements)
      of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and the reserves for annuity and life insurance
      products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees due primarily to
      modifying the valuation of variable annuity products that have elements of
      both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves, modifying our fund
      assumptions, higher maintenance expenses and lower investment spreads than
      our model projections assumed in 2009, compared to a $212 million
      unfavorable prospective unlocking (a $178 million decrease from assumption
      changes and a $34 million decrease from model refinements) due primarily
      to significantly unfavorable equity markets in
  2008:

§

See
      “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for
      more information;

·

A
      $36 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL
      and the reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living
      benefit and death benefit guarantees during 2009 due primarily to the
      overall performance of our GLB derivative program (see “Realized Loss”
      below for more information on our GLB derivative performance), partially
      offset by lower lapses and higher equity market performance than our model
      projections assumed, compared to a $111 million unfavorable retrospective
      unlocking during 2008 due primarily to the impact of lower equity market
      performance and premiums received, higher death claims and expected GDB
      claims than our model projections
assumed;

·

A
      $42 million gain in the first quarter of 2009 associated with the early
      extinguishment of long-term debt;

·

Higher
      net investment income driven primarily by higher average fixed account
      values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts,
      attributable primarily to positive net flows, and higher invested assets
      as a result of issuances of common stock, preferred stock and debt,
      partially offset by less favorable investment income on alternative
      investments due primarily to a deterioration of the capital markets (see
      “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional
      information on our alternative investments) as well as holding higher cash
      balances related to our short-term liquidity strategy during the recent
      volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio
  yield;

·

A
      reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to the release of a
      state income tax liability and favorable tax return true-ups driven by the
      separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other
      items;

·

Lower
      broker-dealer expenses due primarily to lower sales of non-proprietary
      products, lower interest and debt expenses as a result of a decline in
      interest rates and average balances of outstanding debt in 2009, lower
      merger expenses as many of our integration efforts related to our
      acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot have been completed and the implementation
      of several expense initiatives, partially offset by restructuring charges
      related to many of these initiatives and higher incentive compensation
      accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance
      relative to planned goals; and

·

The
      $16 million impact of the initial adoption of the Fair Value Measurements
      and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC on January 1,
  2008.

Comparison
of 2008 to 2007

Net
income decreased due primarily to the following:

·

An
      increase in realized losses on our AFS securities attributable primarily
      to higher OTTI;

·

Impairment
      of goodwill and our FCC license intangible assets on our media business
      attributable primarily to declines in advertising revenues for the entire
      radio market and impairment of our Lincoln UK goodwill due to
      deterioration in the market; however, these non-cash impairments will not
      impact our future liquidity;

·

A
      $212 million unfavorable prospective unlocking (a $178 million decrease
      from assumption changes and a $34 million decrease from model refinements)
      of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and the reserves for annuity and life insurance
      products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees due primarily to
      significantly unfavorable equity markets in 2008, compared to a $10
      million favorable prospective unlocking (a $24 million increase from
      assumption changes due primarily to lower lapses and expenses and higher
      interest rates than our model projections assumed net of a $14 million
      decrease from model refinements) in
2007:

§

See
      “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for
      more information;

·

A
      $111 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL
      and the reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living
      benefit and death benefit guarantees in 2008 due primarily to the impact
      of lower equity market performance and premiums received and higher death
      claims and expected GDB claims than our model projections assumed,
      compared to a $39 million favorable retrospective unlocking in 2007 due
      primarily to the impact of higher equity market performance and
      persistency and lower expenses than our model projections
      assumed;


·

Higher
      benefits due primarily to an increase in the change in GDB reserves from
      an increase in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to
      the decline in account values from the unfavorable equity markets and the
      increase in reserves for products with secondary guarantees from continued
      growth of business in force and the effects of model refinements along
      with higher mortality experience due to an increase in the average
      attained age of the in-force block and lower benefits in the first quarter
      of 2007 related to a purchase accounting adjustment to the opening balance
      sheet of Jefferson-Pilot;

·

Lower
      earnings from our variable annuity and mutual fund (within our Defined
      Contribution segment) products as a result of declines in account values
      caused by decreases in the equity
markets;

·

Lower
      net investment income attributable primarily to less favorable investment
      income on surplus and alternative investments and prepayment and bond
      makewhole premiums due primarily to deterioration of the capital markets
      (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for
      additional information on our alternative investments);
  and

·

The
      $16 million impact of the initial adoption of the Fair Value Measurements
      and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC on January 1,
  2008.

The
      decrease in net income was partially offset by the
    following:

·

Favorable
      GLB net derivatives results due primarily to the inclusion in 2008 of an
      NPR adjustment as required under the Fair Value Measurements and
      Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC attributable primarily to our widening
      credit spreads;

·

Lower
      DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, due
      primarily to declines in variable account values from unfavorable equity
      markets during 2008;

·

The
      loss on disposition of our discontinued operations in
  2007;

·

Growth
      in insurance fees driven by increases in life insurance in force as a
      result of new sales and favorable persistency partially offset by
      unfavorable equity markets and adjustments during the second quarter of
      2007 resulting from adjusting account values for certain of our life
      insurance policies and modifying the accounting for certain of our life
      insurance policies;

·

A
      reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to lower income from
      continuing operations, favorable tax audit adjustments, and favorable tax
      return true-ups driven primarily by the separate account DRD and other
      items; and

·

Lower
      broker-dealer expenses due primarily to lower sales of non-proprietary
      products, lower merger expenses as many of our integration efforts related
      to our acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot have been completed and lower
      incentive compensation accruals as a result of lower earnings and
      production performance relative to planned
  goals.

The
foregoing items are discussed in further detail in results of operations by
segment discussions and “Realized Loss” below.  In addition, for a
discussion of the earnings impact of the equity markets, see “Part II – Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk
– Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.”

Comparison
of 2009 to 2008

Income
from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the
following:

·

A
      $10 million unfavorable prospective unlocking from assumption changes of
      DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders in 2009 due
      primarily to higher maintenance expenses partially offset by higher
      expense assessments than our model projections assumed and modifying the
      valuation of variable annuity products that have elements of both benefit
      reserves and embedded derivative reserves, compared to a $210 million
      unfavorable prospective unlocking from assumption changes of DAC, VOBA,
      DSI, DFEL and reserves for our GDB riders in 2008 due primarily to
      significantly unfavorable equity
markets:

§

See
      “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for
      more information;

·

A
      $29 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and
      reserves for our guarantee riders during 2009 due primarily to lower
      lapses and higher equity market performance than our model projections
      assumed, compared to a $50 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of
      DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders in 2008 due
      primarily to the impact of lower equity market performance than our model
      projections assumed; and


·

Higher
      net investment income, partially offset by higher interest credited,
      excluding unlocking, driven primarily by higher average fixed account
      values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts,
      attributable primarily to positive net flows, actions implemented since
      the third quarter of 2008 to reduce interest crediting rates and an
      increase in investment income on surplus investments due primarily to more
      favorable investment income on alternative investments, partially offset
      by our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances during the
      recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield by 20 basis
      points for 2009:

§

See
      “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional
      information on our alternative
investments.

The
increase in income from operations was partially offset by the
following:

·

An
      increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to an increase in
      earnings, partially offset by more favorable tax return true-ups driven by
      the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items
      in 2009;

·

Lower
      insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account
      values due to unfavorable equity
markets;

·

Higher
      benefits due primarily to an increase in the growth in benefit reserves
      from higher expected GDB benefit
payments;

·

Higher
      underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding
      amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to higher account-value-based
      trail commissions driven by positive net flows, partially offset by the
      impact of unfavorable equity markets on account values, higher incentive
      compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production
      performance relative to planned goals and higher expenses attributable to
      our U.S. pension plans (see discussion in “Additional Information”
      below);

·

Higher
      DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization, net of interest and excluding
      unlocking, due primarily to the reduction in EGPs discussed in “Additional
      Information” below; and

·

A
      less favorable net broker-dealer margin attributable primarily to lower
      sales of non-proprietary products.

Comparison
of 2008 to 2007

Income
from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the
following:

·

A
      $210 million unfavorable prospective unlocking from assumption changes of
      DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our GDB riders (discussed above) in
      2008, compared to a $7 million favorable prospective unlocking (an $18
      million favorable unlocking from assumption changes due primarily to
      favorable interest rates, maintenance expenses and persistency, partially
      offset by less favorable asset-based fees than our model projections
      assumed, net of an $11 million unfavorable unlocking from model
      refinements) in 2007:

§

See
      “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for
      more information;

·

A
      $50 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL
      and reserves for our guarantee riders (discussed above) in 2008, compared
      to a $21 million favorable retrospective unlocking in 2007 due primarily
      to lower lapses and higher equity market performance than our model
      projections assumed;

·

Higher
      benefits from an increase in the change in GDB reserves due to an increase
      in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the decline
      in account values due to the unfavorable equity
  markets;

·

Lower
      net investment income attributable primarily to less favorable investment
      income on surplus and alternative investments due to deterioration of the
      capital markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments”
      below for additional information on our alternative
      investments);

·

Lower
      insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account
      values due to unfavorable equity markets, partially offset by increased
      surrender charges and higher average expense assessment rates due to
      continued growth in rider elections that have incremental charges
      associated with them; and

·

A
      less favorable net broker-dealer margin attributable primarily to lower
      sales of non-proprietary products and lower earnings due to the
      unfavorable equity markets.

The
decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the
following:

·

Lower
      underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding
      unlocking, due primarily to lower DAC and VOBA amortization, net of
      interest, driven by the declines in our variable account values from
      unfavorable equity markets during 2008 and lower incentive compensation
      accruals as a result of lower earnings and production performance relative
      to planned goals; and

·

A
      reduction in federal income tax expense related to a favorable tax return
      true-up driven primarily by the separate account DRD and other items in
      2008, compared to an unfavorable tax return true-up and other items in
      2007.


Additional
Information

We are in
the process of completing a conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a
uniform valuation platform.  This conversion is a continuation of
merger-related activities to harmonize methods and processes and involves an
upgrade to a critical platform for our financial reporting and analysis
capabilities.  As part of this conversion process, we are harmonizing
actuarial models and assumptions that exist between similar blocks of business
within our actuarial models.  Not unlike our prospective unlocking
exercise, this may result in one-time gain and loss adjustments, but we would
expect little net impact to earnings trends.  Although we expect some
differences to emerge as a result of this exercise, based upon the current
status of these efforts, we are not able to provide an estimate or
range of differences upon completion of the conversion.  We expect to
substantially complete some phases of the conversion in the first half of
2010.

Prior to
the second quarter of 2009, the equity markets unfavorably impacted our average
variable account values and the resulting fees earned on these
accounts.  Additionally, weaker credit fundamentals negatively
impacted our investment margins and increased our realized losses on
investments, including OTTI.  As a result, we lowered the projected
EGPs for this segment, which will result in higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL
amortization and lower earnings for this segment.

We saw an
increase in deposits into fixed annuity products toward the early part of 2009
in response to the volatile equity markets.  Deposits moderated in the
fourth quarter of 2009, as customers shifted deposits back into variable annuity
products as equity markets improved, and we expect this trend to continue in
2010 with improving economic conditions.

We expect
to allocate more overhead costs to this segment during 2010, as the disposal of
our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses will result in a
reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses.  See
“Acquisitions and Dispositions” for additional details.  Additionally,
we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 that will result in higher
expenses.

We
experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during 2009
when compared to 2008, but we expect a favorable decline in 2010.  For
details, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefit Plans.”

Although
the segment’s results during 2009 were unfavorably impacted by lower average
account values and the economic environment, its overall net flows were strong
in a challenging economic environment, driving our account values as of December
31, 2009, higher than they were as of December 31, 2008.  New deposits
are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our
business.  Although deposits do not significantly impact current
period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future
profitability.

The other
component of net flows relates to the retention of the business.  An
important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of
withdrawals to the average account values.  The overall lapse rate for
our annuity products was 8%, 9% and 10% for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

See Note
11 below for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related
to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions business.

We expect
to manage the effect of changing market investment returns by managing interest
rate spreads for near-term income from operations through a combination of
crediting rate actions and portfolio management.  Our expectation
includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or
out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads
to differ from our expectation.

Our fixed
annuity business includes products with crediting rates that are reset on an
annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges.  Account values
for these products, including the fixed portion of variable, were $7.0 billion
as of December 31, 2009, with 70% already at their minimum guaranteed
rates.  The average crediting rates for these products were
approximately 37 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed
rates.  Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject
to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products
reset.  For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate
risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed
Insurance Business – Falling Rates.”

We
provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense
line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes
and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers
below.  For detail on the operating realized gain, see “Realized Loss”

We charge
contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts
to cover insurance and administrative expenses.  These assessments are
a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable
account values.  Average daily account values are driven by net flows
and the equity markets.  In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts
and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract
holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to
protect us from premature withdrawals.  Insurance fees include charges
on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees
on our GLB products; see “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain – GLB” below
for discussion of these attributed fees.

A portion
of our investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our fixed
annuity products, including the fixed portion of variable annuity
contracts.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the
underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product
line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we
credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed
portion of variable annuity contracts.  The interest rate spread for
this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves
over the average crediting rate.  The yield on invested assets on
reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts
attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest
expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on
collateral divided by average invested assets on reserves.  The
average invested assets on reserves is calculated based upon total invested
assets, excluding hedge derivatives and collateral.  The average
crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus
the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits) divided by the
average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity
contracts, net of coinsured account values.  Fixed account values
reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values
for this calculation.  Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments
and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and
surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a
number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results
that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

Benefits

Benefits
for this segment include changes in reserves of immediate annuity account values
driven by premiums, changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves and our expected
costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our GDB benefit
ratio unlocking.


Underwriting,
Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses

Details
underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions)
were as follows:

Commissions
and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of
new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the
lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.  We have certain trail
commissions that are based upon account values that are expensed as incurred
rather than deferred and amortized.  These trail commissions were
approximately $165 million, $151 million and $155 million for the years ended
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Broker-dealer
expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and
not deferred and amortized.  Fluctuations in these expenses correspond
with fluctuations in other revenues and fees.

Comparison
of 2009 to 2008

Income
from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the
following:

·

A
      $5 million favorable prospective unlocking from assumption changes of DAC,
      VOBA, DSI and reserves for our guarantee riders in 2009 due primarily to a
      compensation-related change in our wholesaling distribution organization
      that lowered deferrals as a percentage of total expenses incurred and
      lower maintenance expenses than our model projections assumed, compared to
      a $26 million unfavorable prospective unlocking from assumption changes of
      DAC, VOBA, DSI and reserves for our GDB riders in 2008 due primarily to
      continued significantly unfavorable equity
  markets:

§

See
      “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for
      more information;

·

Higher
      net investment income, partially offset by higher interest credited,
      driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the
      fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to
      transfers from variable to fixed since the third quarter of 2008, actions
      implemented during the third quarter of 2009 to reduce interest crediting
      rates and more favorable investment income on surplus and alternative
      investments due to the improvement in the capital markets, partially
      offset by our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances
      during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield by
      13 basis points for 2009:

§

See
      “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional
      information;

·

A
      $1 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI and
      reserves for our guarantee riders in 2009 due primarily to higher lapses
      and maintenance expenses and lower equity market performance than our
      model projections assumed, compared to a $9 million unfavorable
      retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA and DSI in 2008 due primarily to
      higher lapses, maintenance expenses and future GDB claims than our model
      projections assumed; and

·

Lower
      benefits from a decrease in the change in GDB reserves due to a decrease
      in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the
      increase in account values due to the improvement in the equity markets in
      2009.

The
increase in income from operations was partially offset by the
following:

·

Lower
      insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account
      values resulting from the unfavorable equity markets and an overall shift
      in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment
      rates;

·

A
      reduction in federal income tax expense in 2008 due primarily to favorable
      tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD and other items;
      and

·

Higher
      underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding
      unlocking, due primarily to higher expenses attributable to our U.S.
      pension plans (see discussion in “Additional Information” below) and
      higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and
      production performance relative to planned
  goals.


Comparison
of 2008 to 2007

Income
from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the
following:

·

A
      $26 million unfavorable prospective unlocking from assumption changes of
      DAC, VOBA, DSI and reserves for our GDB riders (discussed above) in 2008,
      compared to a $2 million unfavorable prospective unlocking from assumption
      changes in 2007 due primarily to higher lapse rates and lower asset-based
      fees, partially offset by lower expenses than our model projections
      assumed:

§

See
      “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for
      more information;

·

Lower
      insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account
      values resulting from the unfavorable equity markets and an overall shift
      in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment
      rates;

·

Lower
      net investment income attributable primarily to less favorable investment
      income on surplus and alternative investments due to deterioration of the
      capital markets partially offset by higher average fixed account values
      (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for
      additional information on our alternative
  investments);

·

Higher
      interest credited driven primarily by higher average fixed account values,
      including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, driven by
      transfers from variable to fixed;

·

Higher
      benefits from an increase in the change in GDB reserves due to an increase
      in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the decline
      in account values due to the unfavorable equity markets;
    and

·

A
      $9 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA and DSI
      (discussed above) in 2008 compared to a $4 million unfavorable
      retrospective unlocking in 2007 due primarily to higher lapses and less
      favorable asset-based fees than our model projections
    assumed.

The
decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the
following:

·

Lower
      underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding
      unlocking, due primarily to lower DAC and VOBA amortization, net of
      interest, driven by the declines in our variable account values from
      unfavorable equity markets during 2008, the implementation of several
      expense management controls and practices that are focused on aggressively
      managing expenses and lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of
      lower earnings and production performance relative to planned goals;
      and

·

A
      reduction in federal income tax expense related to a favorable tax return
      true-up in 2008.

Additional
Information

We expect
to allocate more overhead costs to this segment during 2010, as the disposal of
our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses will result in a
reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses.  See
“Acquisitions and Dispositions” for additional details.  Additionally,
we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 to improve our infrastructure
and product offerings that will result in higher expenses.

We
experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during 2009
when compared to 2008, but we expect a favorable decline in 2010.  For
details, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefit Plans.”

New
deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow
our business.  Although deposits do not significantly impact current
period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future
profitability.

The other
component of net flows relates to the retention of the business.  An
important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of
withdrawals to the average account values.  The overall lapse rate for our
annuity products was 13%, 15% and 15% for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  Our lapse rate is negatively impacted by the continued net
outflows from our oldest and largest block of annuities business, which is also
our most profitable product line in this segment, due to the fact that it is a
very mature block with much of the account values out of surrender
period.  The proportion of this product to our total account values
was 31%, 34% and 37% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Due to
this expected overall shift in business mix towards products with lower returns,
a substantial increase in new deposit production will be necessary to maintain
earnings at current levels.

See Note
11 below for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related
to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions business.


We expect
to manage the effect of changing market investment returns by managing interest
rate spreads for near-term income from operations through a combination of
crediting rate actions and portfolio management.  Our expectation
includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or
out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads
to differ from our expectation.  For information on interest rate
spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II –
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.”

We charge
expense assessments to cover insurance and administrative
expenses.  Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of
the daily variable account values.  Average daily account values are
driven by net flows and the equity markets.  Our expense assessments
include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund
programs.  In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity
contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their
contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature
withdrawals.

A portion
of our investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our fixed
annuity products, including the fixed portion of variable annuity
contracts.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the
underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product
line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we
credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed
portion of variable annuity contracts.  The interest rate spread for
this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves
over the average crediting rate.  The yield on invested assets on
reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts
attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest
expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on
collateral, divided by average invested assets on reserves.  The
average invested assets on reserves are calculated based upon total invested
assets, excluding hedge derivatives.  The average crediting rate is
calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, divided by the average
fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity
contracts.  Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole
premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment
income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors
and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not
indicative of the underlying trends.

Benefits

Benefits
for this segment include changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves and our
expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our GDB
benefit ratio unlocking.

Underwriting,
Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses

Details
underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions)
were as follows:

Commissions
and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the sale of annuity
contracts are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the
lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.  We have certain trail
commissions that are based upon account values that are expensed as incurred
rather than deferred and amortized.  These trail commissions were
approximately $36 million, $35 million and $36 million for the years ended 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively.  We do not pay commissions on sales of
our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of
these mutual fund products are expensed as incurred.


RESULTS
OF INSURANCE SOLUTIONS

The
Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two
segments:  Life Insurance and Group Protection.  The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and
transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which
is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and
both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including corporate-owned
UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”) products.  The
Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment offers group life, disability and
dental insurance to employers.

For
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in this section, see “Part I –  Item 1A. Risk Factors” and
“Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.

Comparison
of 2009 to 2008

Income
from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the
following:

·

A
      $7 million unfavorable prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and
      secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves from assumption
      changes due primarily to lower investment spreads and higher expenses,
      mortality and lapse rates than our model projections assumed in 2009,
      compared to a $53 million unfavorable prospective unlocking (a $34 million
      unfavorable unlocking from model refinements and a $19 million unfavorable
      unlocking from assumption changes due primarily to the impact of
      significantly unfavorable equity markets on our VUL block of business,
      partially offset by adjustments to secondary guarantee life insurance
      product reserves) in 2008:

§

See
      “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for
      more information;

·

Growth
      in insurance fees and net investment income driven by an increase in
      business in force, partially offset by increases in benefits and
      underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding
      unlocking, the inter-company reinsurance transaction effective December
      31, 2008 (discussed below), and the transfer of a closed block of life
      insurance policies to a third party (discussed below);
  and

·

A
      reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax
      return true-ups in the first quarter of
2009.


The
increase in income from operations was partially offset by the
following:

·

Lower
      net investment income due primarily to unfavorable results from our
      investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated
      Investments

–
      Alternative Investments” below for additional information) and the
      inter-company reinsurance transaction effective December 31, 2008,
      discussed in “Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain” below;
      and

·

The
      transfer of a closed block of life insurance policies to a third party
      discussed in “Additional Information” below, which resulted in reductions
      in insurance fees, net investment income, interest credited, benefits and
      underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other
  expenses.

Comparison
of 2008 to 2007

Income
from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the
following:

·

A
      $53 million unfavorable prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and
      secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves (discussed above) in
      2008, compared to a $4 million favorable prospective unlocking (a $12
      million favorable unlocking from assumption changes due primarily to lower
      lapses and expenses and higher interest rates than our model projections
      assumed, net of an $8 million unfavorable unlocking from model
      refinements) in 2007:

§

See
      “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for
      more information;

·

A
      $24 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, and DFEL in
      2008 due primarily to lower premiums received, higher death claims and
      lower investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond
      makewhole premiums than our model projections assumed, compared to a $28
      million favorable retrospective unlocking in 2007 due primarily to higher
      persistency, higher investment income on alternative investments and
      prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and lower expenses than our model
      projections assumed, partially offset by the impact of a correction to
      account values;

·

An
      increase in benefits due primarily to an increase in secondary guarantee
      life insurance product reserves from continued growth of business in force
      and the effects of model refinements along with higher mortality due to an
      increase in the average attained age of the in-force block as a result of
      targeting higher net worth individuals and lower benefits in the first
      quarter of 2007 related to a purchase accounting adjustment to the opening
      balance sheet of Jefferson-Pilot;
and

·

Lower
      net investment income due primarily to unfavorable results from our
      investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated
      Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information on
      our alternative investments) and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums
      due to deterioration of the financial markets, the inter-company
      reinsurance transaction effective October 2007 and the merger of several
      of our insurance subsidiaries, discussed in “Strategies to Address
      Statutory Reserve Strain” below, and certain assumption changes in the
      fourth quarter of 2007.

The
decrease in income from operations was partially offset by growth in insurance
fees driven by an increase in business in force as a result of new sales and
favorable persistency and an increase in the average attained age of the
in-force block as a result of targeting higher net worth individuals and by a
$41 million reduction related to the impact of the correction to account values
and modifications of accounting related to certain insurance contracts during
the second quarter of 2007.

We
provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense
line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes
and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers
below.

Strategies
to Address Statutory Reserve Strain

Our
insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels above current
regulatory required levels.  As mentioned below, approximately 64% of
our life sales for 2009 consisted of products containing secondary guarantees,
which require reserving practices under AG38.  Our insurance
subsidiaries are employing strategies to reduce the strain of increasing AG38
and XXX statutory reserves associated with secondary guarantee UL and term
products.  As discussed further below, we have been successful in
executing reinsurance solutions to reduce the amount of statutory reserves
required to support these products and releasing capital to Other
Operations.  We expect to regularly execute such transactions as we
continue to sell products that are subject to these reserving requirements, and
we also plan to refinance prior transactions as discussed further
below.  Recently, we introduced new secondary guarantee UL products
that achieve our return requirements without dependency on such reinsurance
solutions.


Included
in the LOCs issued as of December 31, 2009, reported in the credit facilities
table below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and
Capital Resources – Financing Activities,” was approximately $1.7 billion of
LOCs supporting the reinsurance obligations of Lincoln National Reinsurance
Company (Barbados) Limited (“LNBAR”) on UL business with secondary
guarantees.  The underlying credit facilities mature in the first
quarter of 2011; however, the LOCs may remain outstanding until the first
quarter of 2012.  We expect to replace these existing LOCs with a mix
of long-term financing solutions as well as new shorter-term LOCs.  We
previously executed a long-term structured solution of approximately $400
million in 2007.  LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower
the capital impact of secondary guarantee UL products.  An inability
to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could
impact our returns on our in-force secondary guarantee UL
business.  However, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have
sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves if such
structures are not available.  See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors –
Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may
fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations” for further information on XXX
reserves.

As of
December 31, 2009, we released approximately $400 million of capital that
had previously supported statutory reserves related to our term products as a
result of executing on a letter of credit transaction with a third party to
support an inter-company  reinsurance arrangement.  As part of
this transaction, we entered into a $550 million 10-year LOC related to this
business.  For more information on this transaction, see our current
report on Form 8-K filed on January 7, 2010.  This reduction in
capital lowered the level of invested assets required to support the reserves of
this business, which we transferred to Other Operations where we maintain
capital not allocated to our businesses.  The cost of the letter of
credit reflected in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses,
together with the impact of lower net investment income associated with assets
shifting from backing reserves in this segment to surplus in Other Operations,
will reduce this segment’s quarterly income from operations beginning
in 2010 by approximately $7 million, $4 million of which is simply a shift
to Other Operations due to the transfer of invested assets.

As of
December 31, 2008, we released approximately $240 million of capital that had
previously supported statutory reserves related to our UL products with
secondary guarantees as a result of executing on an inter-company reinsurance
transaction.  This reduction in capital lowered the level of invested
assets required to support the reserves of this business.  These
invested assets were transferred to Other Operations to our surplus portfolio as
excess capital, which caused an approximate $4 million per quarter ongoing
reduction in this segment’s net investment income.

As of
December 31, 2007, we reduced statutory reserves related primarily to legal
entity consolidation by $344 million, which caused an approximate $5 million per
quarter ongoing reduction in this segment’s net investment
income.  This reduction in statutory reserves was primarily a result
of the merger of several of our insurance subsidiaries.  In October
2007, we released approximately $300 million of capital that had previously
supported statutory reserves related to our secondary guarantee UL products as a
result of executing on an inter-company reinsurance transaction.  This
reduction in capital lowered the level of invested assets required to support
the reserves of this business.  These invested assets were transferred
to Other Operations to our surplus portfolio as excess capital, which caused an
approximate $5 million per quarter ongoing reduction in this segment’s net
investment income.

Additional
Information

We are in
the process of completing a conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a
uniform valuation platform.  This conversion is a continuation of
merger-related activities to harmonize methods and processes and involves an
upgrade to a critical platform for our financial reporting and analysis
capabilities.  As part of this conversion process, we are harmonizing
methods, assumptions and granularity of calculations that exist between similar
blocks of business within our actuarial models, which is particularly important
in our life insurance segment given that we currently run on two different
systems dating back to the merger with Jefferson-Pilot.  Not unlike
our prospective unlocking exercise, this may result in one-time gain and loss
adjustments, but we would expect little net impact to earnings
trends.  Although we expect some differences to emerge as a result of
this exercise, based upon the current status of these efforts, we are not able
to provide an estimate or range of differences upon completion of
the conversion.  We expect to substantially complete some phases of the
conversion in the first half of 2010.

We expect
to allocate more overhead costs to this segment during 2010, as the disposal of
our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses will result in a
reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses.  See
“Acquisitions and Dispositions” for additional details.  Additionally,
we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 that will also result in
higher expenses.

We
experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during 2009
when compared to 2008, but we expect a favorable decline in 2010.  For
details, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefit Plans.”


Effective
March 31, 2009, we transferred a closed block of business consisting of certain
UL and VUL insurance products to a third party.  During the fourth
quarter of 2009, one of our insurance subsidiaries executed a separate agreement
whereby we assumed the mortality risk associated with this business on a
yearly-renewable basis.  As a result of these transactions, this
segment’s income from operations was reduced by approximately $6 million per
quarter as a result of reductions in insurance fees and net investment income,
partially offset by reductions in interest credited and benefits, that we had
not experienced prior to these transactions.  The assumption of the
mortality risk associated with this business on a yearly-renewable basis
resulted in an approximate $13 million per quarter ongoing increase in insurance
premiums offset by an increase in benefits.  The unfavorable impact to
this segment’s income from operations was partially offset by an approximate $2
million increase to income from operations in Other Operations, as a result of
having higher net investment income due to the transfer of invested assets from
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance attributable to its reduction in capital as
a result of the transfer of this business to a third party; therefore, we expect
our net impact from this transaction to our consolidated net income was a
reduction of $4 million per quarter.

A portion
of the retrospective and prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and secondary
guarantee life insurance product reserves in 2008 resulted in an unfavorable
recurring earnings impact of $7 million per quarter that began in the third
quarter of 2008.

On
January 1, 2010, we implemented a 20 basis point decrease in crediting rates on
most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which is
expected to increase spreads by approximately 3 basis points.  On
March 1, 2009, we implemented a 15 basis point decrease in crediting rates on
most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which
has increased spreads by approximately 5 basis points.  On June 1,
2008, we implemented a 10 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most
interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which has
increased spreads by approximately 5 basis points.  On June 1, 2007, we
implemented a 10 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most
interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which has
increased spreads approximately 5 basis points.

As of
December 31, 2009, 76% of interest-sensitive account values had crediting rates
at contract guaranteed levels, and 12% had crediting rates within 50 basis
points of contractual guarantees.  Going forward, we expect to be able
to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through a
combination of rate actions and portfolio management, which assumes no
significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other
changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our
expectations.  For information on interest rate spreads and the
interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II –  Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Sales are
not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products)
and do not have a significant impact on current quarter income from operations
but are indicators of future profitability.  Generally, we have higher
sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our
strongest.

Insurance
Premiums

Insurance
premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced
into the product and the level of insurance in force.  Insurance in
force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality
experience.

Effective
      with the March 31, 2009, transfer of certain life insurance policies to a
      third party, UL and VUL account values were reduced by $938 million and
      $640 million, respectively, and UL and other face amount in force was
      reduced by $20.9 billion.

(2)

Excludes
      $19.8 billion of face amount in force associated with our assumption of
      the mortality risk effective October 1, 2009, on the block of business
      mentioned in footnote one above.

Insurance
fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality
assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to
DFEL) and surrender charges.  Mortality and expense assessments are
deducted from our contract holders’ account values.  These amounts are
a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face
amount in force and account values.  Insurance in force, in turn, is
driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.  In-force
growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus
UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to
face amount compared to whole life and interest-sensitive products.

Sales in
the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:

·

UL
      (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including COLI and BOLI) –
      first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received,
      including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of
      commissionable premiums;

·

MoneyGuard

® (our
      linked-benefit product) – 15% of premium deposits;
  and

·

Whole
      life and term – 100% of first year paid
  premiums.

UL and
VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 40% of
interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of December 31, 2009, and
approximately 64% of sales for 2009.  Actuarial Guideline 37, or
Variable Life Reserves for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits, and AG38 impose
additional statutory reserve requirements for these products.

Represents
      net investment income on the required statutory surplus for this segment
      and includes the impact of investment income on alternative investments
      for such assets that are held in the portfolios supporting statutory
      surplus versus the portfolios supporting product
    liabilities.


(1)

We
      experienced declines in our average calculations for invested assets on
      reserves and account values attributable to interest-sensitive products
      during 2009 as a result of the transfer of certain life insurance policies
      to a third party effective March 31, 2009, which reduced these balances by
      $927 million and $938 million, respectively, on that
  date.

A portion
of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to contract holder
accounts.  Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than
account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements, which cause statutory
reserves to grow at a faster rate than account values.  Invested
assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are therefore
affected by various reserve adjustments, including capital transactions
providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of
invested assets from this segment to Other Operations for use in other corporate
purposes.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the
underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract
holders’ accounts.  The interest rate spread for this segment
represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the
average crediting rate on interest-sensitive products.  The yield on
invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding
amounts attributable to our surplus investments and reverse repurchase agreement
interest expense, divided by average invested assets on reserves.  In
addition, we exclude the impact of earnings from affordable housing tax credit
securities, which is reflected as a reduction to federal income tax expense,
from our spread calculations.  Traditional products use interest
income to build the policy reserves.  Commercial mortgage loan
prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and investment income on alternative
investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of
factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are
not indicative of the underlying trends.

Benefits
for this segment includes claims incurred during the period in excess of the
associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional
products.  In addition, benefits includes the change in secondary
guarantee life insurance product reserves.  The reserve for secondary
guarantees is impacted by changes in expected future trends of expense
assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA
and DFEL.  Additionally, we establish a reserve for reinsurance margin
(reinsurance premiums paid less death benefit recoveries) and amortize this
margin over the life of the expected insurance assessments for certain blocks of
secondary guarantee UL business.  When we experience unfavorable
mortality, particularly on higher face amount claims, our reinsurance recoveries
can increase significantly and are deferred, which reduces the amount by which
the expense for the direct claims are offset by reinsurance.  The
reinsurance on our secondary guarantee UL business is excess of loss
reinsurance, and this block has a large range of face amounts, both of which
contribute to volatility in our actual experience of reinsurance recoveries as
compared to our expectations.

Underwriting,
Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses

Details
underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions)
were as follows:

Commissions
and other general and administrative expenses that vary with and are related
primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent
recoverable and for our interest-sensitive products are generally amortized over
the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.  For our traditional
products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a
level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of
business.

When
comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for 2009 and 2008, the
increase is a result of incurred deferrable general and administrative expenses
declining at a rate lower than sales.

Comparison
of 2009 to 2008

Income
from operations for this segment increased due to the following:

·

More
      favorable total non-medical loss ratio experience, slightly below the low
      end of our expected range;

·

Growth
      in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our
      non-medical products; and

·

Higher
      net investment income driven by an increase in investment income on
      surplus investments.

The
increase in income from operations was partially offset by an increase to
underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due primarily to higher
expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” for
additional information), an increase in paid premiums and higher incentive
compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance
relative to planned goals, partially offset by higher costs of investments in
strategic initiatives associated with realigning our marketing and distribution
structure in 2008.

During
2009, we experienced exceptional short- and long-term disability loss ratios due
primarily to favorable claims incidence and termination
experience.  We attribute the recent favorable incidence and
termination experience in our long-term disability line of business to be
related, at least in part, to the impact of the challenging economic environment
on our insureds.  In addition, we experienced favorable life loss
ratios during 2009 due primarily to favorable mortality and life waiver
experience, all of which we do not expect will be sustainable
indefinitely.  Consequently, we expect to experience non-medical loss
ratios in 2010 around 70%-71%, which continues to be around the low end of our
historical expected range of 71% to 74%.


We expect
to allocate more overhead costs to this segment during 2010, as the disposal of
our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses will result in a
reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses.  See
“Acquisitions and Dispositions” for additional details.  Additionally,
we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 that will also result in
higher expenses.

We
experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during 2009
when compared to 2008, but we expect a favorable decline in 2010.  For
details, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefit Plans.”

Sales
relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs
sold to existing contract holders.  We believe that the trend in sales
is an important indicator of development of business in force over
time.

Management
focuses on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing
expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time.  We
expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this
segment, as claim experience is inherently uncertain.  As discussed
further above, we expect favorable loss ratio experience in 2010.

Comparison
of 2008 to 2007

Income
from operations for this segment decreased due to the following:

·

Less
      favorable total non-medical loss ratio experience, although still on the
      low end of our expected range; and

·

An
      increase to underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due
      primarily to growth in our business in force, higher 401(k) expenses,
      higher costs of investments in strategic initiatives associated with
      realigning our marketing and distribution structure and an increase in the
      allocation of expenses to this
segment.

The
decrease in income from operations was partially offset by a growth in insurance
premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products
and favorable persistency.

We
provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense
line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes
and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers

Our cost
of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums
charged to our customers.  The premiums are a function of the rates
priced into the product and our business in force.  Business in force,
in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience.  Sales in the
table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and
dental products.

The
business represented as “medical” consists primarily of our non-core
EXEC-U-CARE® product.  This product provides an insured medical
expense reimbursement vehicle to executives for non-covered health plan
costs.  This product produces significant revenues and benefits
expenses for this segment but only a limited amount of
income.  Discontinuance of this product would significantly impact
segment revenues, but not income from operations.


Net
Investment Income

We use
our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which are a
function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested
assets.

Underwriting,
Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses

Details
underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions)
were as follows:

Expenses,
excluding broker commissions, that vary with and are related primarily to the
production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are
amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of
the related contracts depending on the block of business.  Broker
commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as
incurred.  The level of expenses is an important driver of
profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within
an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.


RESULTS
OF OTHER OPERATIONS

Other
Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance
subsidiaries; investments in media properties and other corporate investments;
benefit plan net assets; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance
related to the sale of reinsurance to Swiss Re in 2001; the results of certain
disability income business due to the rescission of a reinsurance agreement with
Swiss Re; the Institutional Pension business, which is a closed-block of pension
business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis, and is
currently in run-off; and external debt.  We are actively managing our
remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future
value.

Comparison
of 2009 to 2008

Loss from
operations for this segment increased due primarily to the
following:

·

The
      $64 million unfavorable impact in the first quarter of 2009 of the
      rescission of the reinsurance agreement on certain disability income
      business sold to Swiss Re as discussed in “Reinsurance” below, which
      resulted in pre-tax increases in benefits of $78 million, interest
      credited of $15 million and other expenses of $5 million, partially offset
      by a $34 million tax benefit, and unfavorable results of our run-off
      disability income business due primarily to an increase in reserves as a
      result of our review of the adequacy of reserves supporting this
      business and the write-off of certain receivables related to the
      rescission in the fourth quarter of 2009 of $33
  million;

·

Lower
      net investment income related to our short-term liquidity strategy during
      the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield and lower
      dividend income from our holdings of Bank of America common stock due to
      dividend rate cuts, partially offset by higher invested assets driven by
      distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, issuances of
      common stock, preferred stock and debt, and proceeds from the sale of
      Lincoln UK, partially offset by transfers to other segments for OTTI;
      and

·

Lower
      media earnings related primarily to the general weakening of the U.S.
      economy causing substantial declines in revenues throughout the radio
      market.


The
increase in loss from operations was partially offset by the
following:

·

Lower
      other expenses attributable primarily to higher merger-related expenses in
      2008 as a result of higher system integration work related to our
      administrative systems and relocation costs associated with the move of
      our corporate office, favorable state income tax true-ups in 2009 and
      lower branding expenses in 2009 due to cost save initiatives, partially
      offset by restructuring charges of $22 million in 2009 related to expense
      reduction initiatives that are discussed further
  below;

·

Lower
      interest and debt expenses as a result of a decline in interest rates that
      affect our variable rate borrowings and lower average balances of
      outstanding debt in 2009; and

·

More
      favorable tax items that impacted the effective tax rate related primarily
      to changes in tax preferred
investments.

Comparison
of 2008 to 2007

Loss from
operations for this segment increased due primarily to the
following:

·

Lower
      media earnings related primarily to declines in discretionary business
      spending, such as advertising, caused by the general weakening of the U.S.
      economy in 2008 causing the media market revenues to decline faster than
      expected;

·

Lower
      net investment income from a reduction in invested assets driven by
      transfers to other segments for OTTI, share repurchases and dividends paid
      to stockholders as these items exceeded the distributable earnings
      received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other
      segments and issuances of debt; and

·

Less
      favorable tax items that impacted the effective tax rate related primarily
      to changes in tax preferred
investments.

The
increase in loss from operations was partially offset by the
following:

·

Lower
      other expenses due primarily to higher merger-related expenses as a result
      of higher system integration work related to our administrative systems, a
      separation benefit related to the retirement of a key executive and a net
      expense related to changes in our employee benefit plans in 2007,
      partially offset by restructuring charges associated with expense
      initiatives, relocation costs associated with the move of our corporate
      office and increases in litigation expense and incentive compensation
      expense in 2008; and

·

Lower
      benefits due to unfavorable mortality in our Institutional Pension
      business in 2007.

Additional
Information

We expect
a lower loss from operations for Other Operations in 2010 than was experienced
in 2009.  The expected decrease is attributable primarily to the
following:

·

Lower
      expenses attributable to the completion of our expense reduction
      initiatives in 2009, partially offset by expected increases in branding
      costs, investments in strategic initiatives and higher allocated overhead
      costs during 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment
      Management businesses will result in a reallocation of overhead expenses
      to our remaining businesses (see “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for
      additional details);

·

Higher
      investment income from an increase in the distributable earnings that will
      be received from our insurance segments due to expected less challenging
      economic conditions; and

·

The
      unfavorable impact of the rescission in 2009 of the reinsurance agreement
      with Swiss Re for disability income business that we do not expect to
      recur.

The
inclusion of run-off disability income business results within Other Operations
due to the rescission of the Swiss Re reinsurance agreement mentioned above may
create volatility in earnings going forward.  As part of our
transition plan related to the rescission, we conducted a study during the
fourth quarter of 2009 to determine the adequacy of the reserves related to this
disability business, which resulted in a $33 million charge to our earnings for
an increase in reserves and a reduction of certain receivables that were deemed
to be uncollectible.

Sustained
market volatility and the challenging economic environment continue to put
pressure on many industries and companies, including our own.  After
reviewing the impact of this difficult economy on our anticipated sales and
business activities, we initiated actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 to
streamline operations, reduce expenses and ensure that staffing levels were
aligned with expected business activity.  Additionally, we initiated a
second expense reduction initiative in the second quarter of 2009, as discussed
below.  We focused on reducing the workforce, reducing capital
spending and addressing corporate-wide discretionary spending.


As a
result of shrinking revenues due to the impact of unfavorable equity markets on
our asset management businesses and a reduction in sales volumes caused by the
unfavorable economic environment, we launched further initiatives to reduce
expenses, including a 12% workforce reduction that was substantially completed
in the second quarter of 2009, that we believe will improve our capital position
and preserve profits.  The restructuring costs associated with these
layoffs are included in other expenses within Other Operations.  See
Note 17 for additional information.

We
provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense
line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes
and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers
below.

Net
Investment Income and Interest Credited

We
utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated
to our business segments.  Investment income on capital in excess of
the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations.  If
regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and
surplus, the amount of capital retained by Other Operations would decrease and
net investment income would be negatively impacted.  In addition, as
discussed below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition –

Alternative
Sources of Liquidity,” we maintain an inter-segment cash management program
where certain subsidiaries can borrow from or lend money to the holding company
to meet short-term borrowing needs.  The inter-segment cash management
program affects net investment income for Other Operations, as all inter-segment
eliminations are reported within Other Operations.

Write-downs
for OTTI decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our
business segments.  These write-downs are not included in the income
from operations of our operating segments.  When impairment occurs,
assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the
future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an impact
on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted
securities.  Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments
can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and
Other Operations.

The
majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to
Swiss Re in 2001.  A substantial amount of the business was sold
through indemnity reinsurance transactions resulting in some of the business
still flowing through our consolidated financial statements.  The
interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we
continue to hold for this business.  There is no impact to income or
loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because
interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to
Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.

Merger-related
expenses were the result of actions undertaken by us to eliminate duplicate
operations and functions as a result of the Jefferson-Pilot merger along with
costs related to the implementation of our new unified product portfolio and
other initiatives.  These actions were substantially completed during
2009.  Our cumulative integration expense was approximately $225
million, pre-tax, which excludes amounts capitalized or recorded as
goodwill.

Starting
in December 2008, we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the current
economic downturn and sustained market volatility, which focused on reducing
expenses.  The expenses associated with this initiative are reported
in restructuring charges for expense initiatives above.  Our
cumulative pre-tax charges amounted to $42 million for severance, benefits and
related costs associated with the plan for workforce reduction and other
restructuring actions.

Interest
and Debt Expense

Our
current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to,
among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds
from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of
capital.  For additional information on our financing activities, see
“Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources –

DAC

      changes in other contract holder funds and funds withheld reinsurance
      liabilities.

For
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking
Statements – Cautionary Language” above.

For
information on our counterparty exposure see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”


Comparison
of 2009 to 2008

GLB net
derivatives results declined due primarily to the NPR component of the liability
being unfavorable in 2009 attributable to a narrowing of credit spreads and a
reduction in the overall level of the liability before the application of the
NPR to the discount rate.  See “GLB Net Derivatives Results” below for
a discussion of how our NPR adjustment is determined.  This decline
was partially offset by significantly more favorable GLB hedge program
performance in 2009 relative to 2008.  In 2008, the result was largely
driven by extremely volatile capital markets.  At the end of the
second quarter of 2009, we made a strategic decision to reduce our interest rate
coverage as we prepared for the adoption of VACARVM, which was effective for
statutory accounting on December 31, 2009.  The reduced coverage on
rates resulted in favorable performance for the second half of 2009; however,
this strategic risk position was mitigated on December 31, 2009.

The 2009
unfavorable prospective unlocking for assumption changes related primarily to
modifying the valuation of variable annuity products that have elements of both
benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves and modifying our fund
assumptions with regard to our hedged indices.  The 2008 favorable
unlocking for assumption changes related primarily to assumptions associated
with the GLB reserves reflecting primarily updates to implied ultimate
volatility.

The 2008
unfavorable prospective DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL unlocking related to the GLB
reserves reflecting the impact of incorporating the change in EGPs resulting
from the change in assumptions for the reserves discussed above into the DAC,
VOBA, DSI and DFEL models.

The
unfavorable decline in GDB derivative results was attributable primarily to the
favorable equity markets in 2009 as compared to unfavorable in
2008.

The
decline in the realized loss related to certain investments was attributable
primarily to the lower OTTI.  This is due to general improvement in
the credit markets and the change in the accounting for impairments under the
Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC that is effective
for impairments recorded after January 1, 2009.  For a further
explanation of this change, see Note 2.  For more information on
realized losses on certain investments, see “Consolidated Investments – Realized
Loss Related to Investments” below.

The gain
on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities in 2009 was due primarily
to the rescission of the Swiss Re indemnity reinsurance agreement covering
certain disability income business, whereby we released the embedded derivative
liability related to the funds withheld nature of the reinsurance
agreement.  Prior to the rescission of the Swiss Re indemnity
reinsurance agreement, the fluctuations in the fair value of the trading
securities mostly offset the fair value fluctuations in the embedded derivative
of the reinsurance agreement with the net difference reported as a realized gain
or loss.  The release of this embedded derivative liability increased
net income by approximately $31 million in the first quarter of
2009.  Since the rescission, this line item is impacted by market
conditions as we now have trading securities that are no longer supporting an
embedded derivative liability due to the rescission causing us to release that
liability.  Consequently, we may experience more volatility in the
fluctuation of this component of realized gain or loss in the
future.  During 2009, the value of these trading securities increased
due to changes in interest rates.  For more information, see
“Reinsurance” below and Note 9.

Comparison
of 2008 to 2007

The
favorable GLB net derivatives results in 2008 were attributable to the
following:

·

The
      inclusion in 2008 of an NPR adjustment as a result of the adoption of the
      Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC and its
      component of determining the fair value of the embedded derivative
      liability due primarily to our widening credit
  spreads;

·

Hedge
      program effectiveness; and

·

Favorable
      unlocking.


In 2008,
our hedge was generally effective, excluding the effects of unlocking and the
NPR adjustment, with changes in reserves largely offset by the increase in
market value of the hedge assets.  There were several largely
offsetting factors, both favorable and unfavorable, that led to this
result.  Significant unfavorable items included:  poor
underlying fund performance relative to the hedge instruments used; volatile
capital market conditions that resulted in non-linear changes in reserves that
our derivatives are not specifically designed to mitigate; and losses from the
strengthening of the dollar as compared to the euro, pound and yen.  A
large portion of these unfavorable results in 2008 was attributable to overall
market performance during October 2008 and four specific days in September on
which capital markets were extremely volatile, including the first market day
after the Lehman bankruptcy and the day Congress originally failed to pass the
original EESA legislation.  Significant favorable items included
movements in swap spreads and a change in the characteristics of certain GIB
features that resulted in lower liabilities than had been assumed in
establishing our hedge positions.  As account values declined, the
characteristics of certain GIB features shifted towards benefit reserves as
opposed to embedded derivative reserves.

The 2008
favorable GLB change in reserves hedged related primarily to assumption changes
that reflected updates to implied volatility assumptions, which, overall,
reduced the fair value of the embedded derivatives.  The 2007
unfavorable GLB change in reserves hedged related primarily to assumption
changes that reflected improved persistency experience, which increased future
expected claims leading to an increase in liabilities.

The 2008
unfavorable GLB DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL prospective unlocking was due primarily
to the impact on the DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL models of the aforementioned
assumption changes made in calculating the reserves hedged and the continued
significantly unfavorable equity markets.

During
2008, the change in fair value of GDB derivatives was favorable due to certain
favorable movements in swap spreads and implied volatilities, partially offset
by fund underperformance of our hedges, losses from the strengthening of the
dollar as compared to the euro, pound and yen, and volatile capital market
conditions.

Indexed Annuity Net Derivative
Results

Indexed
annuity net derivatives results represent the net difference between the change
in the fair value of the S&P 500 call options that we hold and the change in
the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity
products.  The change in the fair value of the liability for the
embedded derivative represents the amount that is credited to the indexed
annuity contract.

GLB

Our GWB,
GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded
derivative reserves.  We calculate the value of the embedded
derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics
of each GLB feature.  For our GLBs that meet the definition of an
embedded derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, we
record them at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in realized loss
on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).  In bifurcating the
embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of
total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders
(the “attributed fees”).  These attributed fees represent the present
value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the
contract (the “net valuation premium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market
participant would include for risk/profit (the “risk/profit
margin”).

Our
methodology for calculating the NPR component of the embedded derivative reserve
utilizes an extrapolated 30-year NPR spread curve applied to a series of
expected cash flows over the expected life of the embedded
derivative.  Our cash flows consist of both expected fees to be
received from contract holders and benefits to be paid, and these cash flows are
different on a pre- and post- NPR basis are different.  The difference
in the cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulted in an increase
to the GLB reserve liability in excess of the liability that we
hedge.  We utilize a model based on our holding company’s CDS spreads
adjusted for items, such as the liquidity of our holding company
CDS.  Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within
our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the impact of our insurance
subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and
the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine
factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of
the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance
subsidiaries.  Details underlying the NPR component and associated
impact to our GLB embedded derivative reserves (dollars in millions) were as

We
      experienced significant widening of our CDS spreads during the first
      quarter of 2009.  We compared our CDS spreads to those of our
      peer companies with similar holding company ratings and determined that
      our company specific spreads were significantly wider due to the market’s
      concerns over our holding company liquidity.  As a result, we
      reduced the spreads used in the calculation of our NPR factors to be in
      line with our peers.  Therefore, the starting point for our
      spreads was reduced over the entire term structure with the 10-year at
      8.45%.

The $546
million change in the NPR component of the liability from December 31, 2008, to
December 31, 2009, was attributable primarily to change in the NPR factors and
the decrease in the unadjusted embedded derivative
liability.  Estimating what the absolute amount of the NPR effect will
be period to period is difficult due to the utilization of all cash flows and
the shape of the spread curve.  For 2009, the spread curve flattened
significantly.  Currently, we estimate that if the NPR factors as of
December 31, 2009, were to have been zero along all points on the spread curve,
then the NPR offset to the unadjusted liability would have resulted in an
unfavorable impact to net income of $29 million, pre-DAC* and
tax.  Alternatively, if the NPR factors were 20 basis points higher
along all points on the spread curve as of December 31, 2009, then there would
have been a favorable impact to net income of $48 million, pre-DAC* and
tax.  Changing market conditions could cause this relationship to
deviate significantly in future periods.  Sensitivity within this
range is primarily a result of volatility in our CDS spreads and the slope of
the CDS spread term structure.

DAC

We
include the risk/profit margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in

attributed rider fees in excluded realized loss.  For our Retirement
Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segments,
the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB
attributed rider fees is reported in insurance fees.

GLB
Net Derivatives Results

Our GLB
net derivatives results are comprised of the net valuation premium, the change
in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and the change in the fair value of the
derivative instruments we own to hedge them, including the cost of purchasing
the hedging instruments.

Our GWB,
GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded
derivative reserves.  We calculate the value of the embedded
derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics
of each GLB feature.  We record the embedded derivative reserve on our
GLBs at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We use
derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings
volatility that result from changes in the GLB embedded derivatives
reserves.  The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is
designed to generally offset the change in embedded derivative
reserves.  In the table above, we have presented the components of our
GLB results, which can be volatile especially when sudden and significant
changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur.  When we assess
the effectiveness of our hedge program, we exclude the impact of the change in
the component of the embedded derivative reserves related to the required
NPR.  We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of
the liability.  As of December 31, 2009, the net effect of the NPR
resulted in a $33 million increase in the liability for our GLB embedded
derivative reserves.  See above for information regarding the effect
of the NPR on the GLB net derivatives results for the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008.  For additional information on our guaranteed benefits,
see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed
Living Benefits” above.

GDB
Derivatives Results

Our GDB
derivatives results represent the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments we own to hedge the change in our benefit ratio unlocking, excluding
our expected cost of the hedging instruments.

Indexed
Annuity Forward-Starting Option

Details
underlying indexed annuity forward-starting option (dollars in millions) were as
follows:

(1)

This
      new accounting guidance was included in the Fair Value Measurements and
      Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC.

(2)

DAC
      refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and
      DFEL.

The
liability for the forward-starting option reflects changes in the fair value of
embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in
the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset
periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and
Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB
ASC.  These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the
options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the
balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest
rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of
factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the
underlying trends.


CONSOLIDATED
INVESTMENTS

Details
underlying our consolidated investment balances (in millions) were as
follows:

Investment
Objective

Invested
assets are an integral part of our operations.  We follow a balanced
approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with
an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet
our obligations to customers, as well as other general
liabilities.  This balanced approach requires the evaluation of
expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our
income objectives.  This approach is important to our asset-liability
management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and
current investment income considerations affecting assets and
liabilities.  For a discussion on our risk management process, see
“Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.”

Investment
Portfolio Composition and Diversification

Fundamental
to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes.  Our
investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed
maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either
wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term
investments.  We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios
that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the
liabilities of the products being supported.

We have
the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because
of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the
matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our
various products.

Fixed
Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios

Fixed
maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as
AFS and trading.  Mortgage-backed and private securities are included
in both AFS and trading portfolios.


Details
underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry
classification (in millions) are presented in the below tables.  These
tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 5;
however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS
portfolio; therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree
to the investment categories provided in Note 5.


(1)

Certain
      of our trading securities support our modified coinsurance arrangements
      (“Modco”) and the investment results are passed directly to the
      reinsurers.  Refer below to the “Trading Securities” section for
      further details.


AFS
Securities

The
general intent of the AFS accounting guidance is to reflect stockholders’ equity
as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and it is necessary
that we consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a
hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses.  Such related
balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL,
other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes.  Adjustments to
each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated
OCI.  For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized
gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed
emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business.  Deferred
income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not
affect actual taxes currently paid.

The
quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated
fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities invested in
various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security
portfolio (in millions) was as follows:

Comparisons
between the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) ratings and
rating agency designations are published by the NAIC.  The NAIC
assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by
insurers when preparing their annual statements.  The NAIC ratings are
similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized
Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds.  NAIC ratings 1
and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher
by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings
organizations.  However, securities rated NAIC 1 and NAIC 2 could be
below investment grade by the rating agencies, which is a result of the changes
in the RBC rules for RMBS securities that were effective December 31, 2009, for
statutory reporting.  NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally
considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+
or lower by S&P and Fitch).

As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, 80.3% and 92.3%, respectively, of the total publicly
traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as
investment grade.  See Note 5 for maturity date information for our
fixed maturity investment portfolio.  Our gross unrealized losses on
AFS securities decreased $4.6 billion in 2009, which was attributable primarily
to increased liquidity in several market segments and improved credit
fundamentals, partially offset by, the cumulative adjustment of the recognition
of OTTI, which resulted in the $165 million increase in amortized cost in AFS
securities as discussed in Note 2.  As more fully described in Note 5,
we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI.  We believe the
unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2009, does not represent OTTI as we
do not intend to sell these debt securities, it is not more likely than not that
we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their
amortized cost basis, the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater
than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, or we have the ability and
intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for
recovery.  For further information on our AFS securities unrealized
losses, see “Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities”
below.

The
estimated fair value for all private securities was $8.0 billion and $7.1
billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing
approximately 11% of total invested assets as of December 31, 2009 and
2008.


Trading
Securities

Trading
securities, which in certain cases support reinsurance funds withheld and our
Modco reinsurance agreements, are carried at estimated fair value and changes in
estimated fair value are recorded in net income as they
occur.  Investment results for these certain portfolios, including
gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers through the
contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements.  Offsetting these
amounts in certain cases are corresponding changes in the fair value of the
embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance
arrangement.  See Notes 1 and 9 for more information regarding our
accounting for Modco.

Mortgage-Backed
Securities (“MBS”) (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)

Our fixed
maturity securities include MBS.  These securities are subject to
risks associated with variable prepayments.  This may result in
differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than
that expected at the time of purchase.  Securities that have an
amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster
than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss.  Those
securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than
expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain.  In addition,
we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields
earned on the securities.  Prepayments occurring slower than expected
have the opposite impact.  We may incur reinvestment risks if market
yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and we are
forced to sell the securities.  The degree to which a security is
susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by:  the
difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the
underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest
rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall
securitization structure.

We limit
the extent of our risk on MBS by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class,
by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly
exceeds par, by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral and by
concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust
structure.  Such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower
yield (but higher liquidity) than higher-risk MBS.  At selected times,
higher-risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of
the general portfolio.  As of December 31, 2009, we did not have a
significant amount of higher-risk, trust structured MBS.  A
significant amount of assets in our MBS portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S.
government-sponsored enterprises or are supported in the securitization
structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment
grade status.

Our
exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and
other financial institutions that may be impacted by subprime lending and direct
investments in ABS CDOs, ABS and residential mortgage-backed securities
(“RMBS”).  Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and
RMBS are backed by residential mortgages.  These securities are backed
by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of
creditworthiness:  prime, Alt-A and subprime.  Prime lending
is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent
credit profiles.  Alt-A lending is the origination of residential
mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit profiles but lack
documentation to substantiate income.  Subprime lending is the
origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit
profiles.

The
slowing U.S. housing market, increased interest rates for non-prime
borrowers and relaxed underwriting standards over the last several years
have led to higher delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and home
equity loans.  We expect delinquency rates and loss rates on
residential mortgages and home equity loans to increase in the future; however,
we continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms
for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the
claims on the collateral of the securities that we own.  The tranches
of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with
the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche,
taking the initial loss.  The credit ratings of our securities reflect
the seniority of the securities that we own.  Our RMBS had a market
value of $9.9 billion and an unrealized loss of $620 million, or 6%, as of
December 31, 2009.  The unrealized loss was due primarily to
deteriorating fundamentals and a general level of illiquidity in the market
resulting in price declines in many structured products.


The
market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans
was $435 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2009.  AFS securities represent $423 million, or
97%, and trading securities represent $12 million, or 3%, of the subprime
exposure as of December 31, 2009.  AFS securities and trading
securities rated A or above represented 63% of the subprime investments and $213
million in market value of our subprime investments was backed by loans
originating in 2005 and forward.  The tables below summarize our
investments in AFS securities backed by pools of residential mortgages (in
millions):

(1)

Does
      not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $220 million,
      which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results
      for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.  The
      $220 million in trading securities consisted of $192 million prime, $16
      million Alt-A and $12 million
subprime.

(2)

For
      the table above, credit ratings shown in the document are based on ratings
      provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings, Moody’s and
      S&P) or are based on internal ratings for those securities where
      external ratings are not available.  For securities where the
      ratings assigned by the major rating agencies are not equivalent, the
      second highest of the three ratings assigned is
  used.


(1)

Does
      not include the amortized cost of trading securities totaling $235
      million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment
      results for these agreements are passed directly to the
      reinsurers.  The $235 million in trading securities consisted of
      $196 million prime, $22 million Alt-A and $17 million
      subprime.

      external ratings are not available.  For securities where the
      ratings assigned by the major rating agencies are not equivalent, the
      second highest of the three ratings assigned is
  used.

None of
these investments include any direct investments in subprime lenders or
mortgages.  We are not aware of material exposure to subprime loans in
our alternative asset portfolio.


The
following summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of
consumer loan asset-backed securities (in millions):

(1)

Additional
      indirect credit card exposure through structured securities is excluded
      from this table.  See “Credit-Linked Notes” in Note
      5.

      ratings assigned by the major rating agencies are not equivalent, the
      second highest of the three ratings assigned is
  used.

(3)

Does
      not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $2 million,
      which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results
      for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.  The
      $2 million in trading securities consisted of credit card
      securities.


The
following summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of
commercial mortgages (in millions):

(1)

Does
      not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $83 million,
      which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results
      for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.  The
      $83 million in trading securities consisted of $81 million CMBS and $2
      million CRE CDOs.

Monoline
insurers provide guarantees on debt for issuers, often in the form of credit
wraps, which enhance the credit of the issuer. Monoline insurers guarantee the
timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and
generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues such as municipal bonds and
private placements as well as other types and structures of
securities.  Our direct exposure represents our bond holdings of the
actual Monoline insurers.  Our insured bonds represent our holdings in
bonds of other issuers that are insured by Monoline insurers.

The
following summarizes our exposure to Monoline insurers (in
millions):

(1)

Additional
      direct exposure through credit default swaps with a notional value
      totaling $98 million is excluded from this
  table.

(2)

Additional
      indirect insured exposure through structured securities is excluded from
      this table.  See “Credit-Linked Notes” in Note
  5.

(3)

Does
      not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $32 million,
      which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results
      for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.  The
      $32 million in trading securities consisted of $12 million of direct
      exposure and $20 million of insured exposure.  This table also
      excludes insured exposure totaling $13 million for a guaranteed investment
      tax credit partnership.

Additional
Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities

When
considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize
that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point
in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios
subsequent to the balance sheet date.  Further, because the timing of
the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of
which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important
to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall
unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios.  These
are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the
potential impact of unrealized loss securities on our future
earnings.


We have
no concentrations of issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity and equity
securities.  The composition by industry categories of securities
subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized
loss status (in millions) for our securities that we believe were most at risk
of impairment, was as follows:

In
addition, as discussed in Note 1, we perform detailed analysis of our AFS
securities, including those presented above as well as other AFS
securities.  For selected information on these AFS securities in a
gross unrealized loss position backed by pools, as of December 31, 2009, see
Note 5.



The
composition by industry categories of all securities in unrealized loss status
(in millions), was as follows:



Unrealized
Loss on Below Investment Grade AFS Fixed Maturity Securities

Gross
unrealized losses on AFS fixed maturity securities below investment grade fixed
maturity securities represented 47.5% and 12.9% of total gross unrealized losses
on all AFS securities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  Generally, below investment grade fixed maturity
securities are more likely than investment grade securities to develop credit
concerns.  The remaining 52.5% and 87.1% of the gross unrealized
losses as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relate to investment
grade AFS securities.  The ratios of estimated fair value to amortized
cost reflected in the table below were not necessarily indicative of the market
value to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire
time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they
necessarily indicative of these ratios subsequent to December 31,
2009.


Details
underlying fixed maturity securities below investment grade and in an unrealized
loss position (in millions) were as follows:



Mortgage
Loans on Real Estate

The
following summarizes key information on mortgage loans (in
millions):

As
discussed above in “Current Market Conditions,” the global financial markets and
credit market conditions experienced a period of extreme volatility and
disruption that began in the second half of 2007 and continued and substantially
increased throughout 2008 that led to a decrease in the overall liquidity and
availability of capital in the mortgage loan market, and in particular a
decrease in activity by securitization lenders.  These conditions and
the overall economic downturn put pressure on the fundamentals of mortgage loans
through rising vacancies, falling rents and falling property
values.


Loan-to-value
and debt-service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the
quality of mortgage loans.  The loan-to-value ratio compares the
principal amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property
collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a
percentage.  Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% percent indicate
that the principal amount is greater than the collateral
value.  Therefore, all else being equal, a smaller loan-to-value ratio
generally indicates a higher quality loan.  The debt-service coverage
ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt-service
payments.  Debt-service coverage ratios less than 1.0 times indicates
that property operations do not generate enough income to cover its current debt
payments.  Therefore, all else being equal, a larger debt-service
coverage ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan.   The
following summarizes our loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios (in
millions):

All
mortgage loans that are impaired have an established allowance for credit
loss.  Changing economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage
loans.  Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the
discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may
contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance
for credit losses.  In addition, we continue to monitor the entire
commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk.  Areas of
emphasis are properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt
coverage reduction.  Where warranted, we have established or increased
loss reserves based upon this analysis.  There were nine impaired
mortgage loans as of December 31, 2009, or less than 1% of the total dollar
amount of mortgage loans, and no impaired mortgage loans as of December 31,
2008.  As of December 31, 2009, there were eight commercial mortgage
loans that were two or more payments delinquent.  As of December 31,
2008, there were no commercial mortgage loans that were two or more payments
delinquent.  The carrying value on the mortgage loans that were two or
more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2009, was $36 million, or less than
1% of total mortgage loans.  The total principal and interest past due
on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of December
31, 2009, was $2 million.  See Note 1 for more information regarding
our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans.

      required statutory surplus of our insurance
  businesses.

The
decline in our investment income on alternative investments presented in the
table above when comparing 2009 to 2008 was due to the impact of audit
adjustments related to completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of
the investments within our portfolio and deterioration of the financial
markets.  The nature of these adjustments is discussed further
below.  This weakness was concentrated primarily in our energy,
domestic venture capital and real estate limited partnership
holdings.

As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, alternative investments included investments in
approximately 99 and 102 different partnerships, respectively and the portfolio
represents less than 1% of our overall invested assets.  The
partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve
several third-party partners.  Some of our partnerships contain
capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the
general partner.  These capital calls are contemplated during the
initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call
date.  The capital calls are not material in size and are not material
to our liquidity.  The capital calls are included on the table of
contingent commitments in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition –
Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.  Alternative investments are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other
investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As
discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments –
Valuation of Alternative Investments,” we update the carrying value of our
alternative investment portfolio whenever audited financial statements of the
investees for the preceding year become available. Our investment income from
alternative investments for the second quarter of 2009 included a pre-tax loss
of $71 million, of which

$57

million of the losses
were attributable to audit adjustments to partnerships’ 2008 financial
statements.  The breakdown of these audit adjustments by segment was
as follows:  $50 million for Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance; $1
million for Insurance Solutions – Group Protection; $3 million for Retirement
Solutions – Annuities; and $3 million for Retirement Solutions – Defined
Contribution.   Our investment income from alternative
investments for the third quarter of 2009 included a $12 million, pre-tax, loss
which was attributable to audit adjustments to partnerships’ 2008 financial
statements for our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment.  Our
investment income from alternative investments for the fourth quarter of 2009
included a $3 million, pre-tax, loss that was attributable to audit adjustments
to partnerships’ 2008 financial statements for our Insurance Solutions – Life
Insurance segment.

Income
(loss), after-tax, derived from our consolidated alternative investments by
class (in millions) related to the impact of December 31, 2008, audit

We
believe these December 31, 2008, audit adjustments recorded during 2009 for each
of the asset classes related primarily to the adoption of Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC and refinements to the
valuation techniques or models used by the investees within our portfolio, which
was impacted by the continued deterioration of the financial
markets.  During 2008, there was extreme volatility and disruption
that affected the equity and credit markets and made it challenging to arrive at
certain assumptions utilized in the investee company’s valuation methodologies,
which, in turn, determined the fair value of their respective portfolio
companies.  Specifically, our understanding is that subjective
assumptions such as forward-looking growth projections, discount rates utilized
to present value expected future cash flows generated from the portfolio
companies, among other items, were the focus of heavy debate and ultimately the
net asset values of these particular investee companies were revised to reflect
the downward revised valuations.

Non-Income
Producing Investments

As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities,
mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was
$38 million and $15 million, respectively.

We earn
investment income on our general account assets supporting fixed annuity, term
life, whole life, UL, interest-sensitive whole life, and fixed portion of
defined contribution and VUL products.  The profitability of our fixed
annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target
spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account
assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed
account values, including the fixed portion of variable.  Net
investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial
mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments
and contingent interest and standby real estate equity
commitments.  These items can vary significantly from period to period
due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not
indicative of the underlying trends.

The
increase in net investment income when comparing 2009 to 2008 was attributable
to higher account values due primarily to positive net flows and higher invested
assets driven primarily by issuances of common stock, preferred stock and debt,
partially offset by a decline in investment income on alternative investments
and in conjunction with our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash
balances in the first half of the year during the more volatile markets reducing
portfolio yield.

Standby
Real Estate Equity Commitments

Historically,
we have entered into standby commitments, which obligated us to purchase real
estate at a specified cost if a third-party sale does not occur within
approximately one year after construction is completed.  These
commitments were used by a developer to obtain a construction loan from an
outside lender on favorable terms.  In return for issuing the
commitment, we received an annual fee and a percentage of the profit when the
property is sold.  Our long-term expectation is that we will be
obligated to fund a small portion of these commitments that remain
outstanding.  However, due to the current economic environment, we may
experience increased funding obligations.  During the year ended
December 31, 2009, we recorded $83 million to realized loss on our Consolidated
Statement of Income (Loss).

As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had standby real estate equity commitments
totaling $220 million and $267 million, respectively.  During 2009, we
funded commitments of $46 million and the fair value of the associated real
estate of $32 million is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which
resulted in the recognition of $14 million in realized losses.  In
addition, we recorded an estimated loss of $69 million in 2009 on projects due
to our belief that our requirement to fund the projects in accordance with the
standby equity commitment is probable.

During
2009, we suspended entering into new standby real estate
commitments.

Commercial
Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums

Prepayment
and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay
their debt prior to the stated maturity.  A prepayment or makewhole
premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all
scheduled interest payments until maturity.  These premiums are
designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.

The
decline in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing 2009 to 2008 was
attributable primarily to the continued tightening of credit conditions in the
market resulting in less refinancing activity and less prepayment
income.

Amortization
expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds
reflects an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment
losses.  When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we
recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in
other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental
impact of actual versus expected credit-related investment
losses.  These actual to expected amortization adjustments could
create volatility in net realized gains and losses.  The write-down
for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related
impairments.

Realized
gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the
portfolio or to respond to product experience.  During 2009, 2008 and
2007, we sold securities for gains and losses.  In the process of
evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are
other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security
prior to a recovery of value.  However, subsequent decisions on
securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring,
assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio
maintenance.  Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in
time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with
unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered,
the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision
to sell.  These subsequent decisions are consistent with the
classification of our investment portfolio as AFS.  We expect to
continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a
manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.

We
consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries
where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of
securities we own of similarly situated issuers.  While it is possible
for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other
investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks
and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio.  Once
identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and
manage these risks.  The areas of risk correlation that we pay
particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific
financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks
associated with related parties.

When the
detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads
to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is
other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery
value.  In instances where declines are considered temporary, the
security will continue to be carefully monitored.  See “Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates” for additional information on our portfolio
management strategy.

When
comparing 2009 to 2008, the decrease in write-downs for OTTI on our AFS
securities was attributable primarily to overall improvement in the credit
markets as compared to the same period in prior year.  Losses in 2009
were attributable primarily to certain corporate bond holdings within the
Financial, Automotive and Gaming sectors, as well as deteriorating fundamentals
within the housing market that affected select RMBS holdings.

The $597
million of impairments taken during 2009 were split between $575 million of
credit-related impairments and $22 million on non-credit related
impairments.  The credit-related impairments were largely attributable
to our RMBS and mortgage-related ABS holdings that have suffered from continued
deterioration in housing fundamentals.  The non-credit related
impairments were incurred due to declines in values of securities for which we
have an intent to sell or it is more likely than not that we will sell the
securities before recovery.

REINSURANCE

Our
insurance companies cede insurance to other companies.  The portion of
risks exceeding each of our insurance companies’ retention limits is reinsured
with other insurers.  We seek reinsurance coverage within the
businesses that sell life insurance to limit our exposure to mortality losses
and enhance our capital management.  We utilize inter-company
reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital position as well as our
hedge program for variable annuity guarantees.  These inter-company
agreements do not have an impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Portions
of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance
basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate
risks.  As of December 31, 2009, the reserves associated with these
reinsurance arrangements totaled $995 million.  To cover products
other than life insurance, we acquire other insurance coverage with retentions
and limits that management believes are appropriate for the
circumstances.  The consolidated financial statements included in
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” reflect premiums, benefits
and DAC, net of insurance ceded.  Our insurance companies remain
liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet contractual obligations under
applicable reinsurance agreements.


Our
amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves
ceded to reinsurers.  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amounts
recoverable from reinsurers were $6.4 billion and $8.4 billion,
respectively.  We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of
reinsurers, and we monitor concentration and financial strength ratings of our
principal reinsurers.  Swiss Re represents our largest
exposure.  In 2001, we sold our reinsurance business to Swiss Re
primarily through indemnity reinsurance arrangements.  Because we are
not relieved of our liability to the ceding companies for this business, the
liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured policies remain on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from
Swiss Re, which totaled $3.0 billion and $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively.  Swiss Re has funded a trust with a balance of
$1.9 billion as of December 31, 2009, to support this business.  As a
result of Swiss Re’s S&P financial strength rating dropping below AA-, Swiss
Re funded an additional trust during the fourth quarter of 2009 with a balance
of approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2009, to support this
business.  In addition to various remedies that we would have in the
event of a default by Swiss Re, we continue to hold assets in support of certain
of the transferred reserves.  These assets consist of those reported
as trading securities and certain mortgage loans.  Our liabilities for
funds withheld and embedded derivatives included $1.3 billion and $30 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2009, related to the business sold to Swiss
Re.

We sold a
block of disability income business to Swiss Re as part of several indemnity
reinsurance transactions executed in 2001, as discussed above.  On
January 24, 2009, an award of rescission was declared related to an ongoing
dispute between us and Swiss Re for this treaty, which requires us to be fully
responsible for all claims incurred and liabilities supporting this block as if
the reinsurance treaty never existed. We completed a review of the adequacy
of the reserves supporting the liabilities during the fourth quarter of
2009.  See Note 14 for a discussion of the effects of the
rescission.

During
the third quarter of 2006, one of our reinsurers, Scottish Re Group Ltd
(“Scottish Re”), received rating downgrades from various rating
agencies.  Of the $605 million of fixed annuity business that we
reinsure with Scottish Re, approximately 83% is reinsured through the use of
modified coinsurance treaties, in which we possess the investments that support
the reserves ceded to Scottish Re.  For our annuity business ceded on
a coinsurance basis, Scottish Re had previously established an irrevocable
investment trust supporting the reserves for the benefit of LNC.  In
addition to fixed annuities, we have approximately $138 million of policy
liabilities on the life insurance business that we have reinsured with Scottish
Re.  Scottish Re continues to perform under its contractual
responsibilities to us.  We continue to evaluate the impact of these
rating downgrades with respect to our existing exposures to Scottish
Re.  Based on current information, we do not believe that Scottish
Re’s rating downgrades will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, liquidity or financial condition.

See Note
9 for further information regarding reinsurance transactions.

For
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking
Statements – Cautionary Language” above.

REVIEW
OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Sources
of Liquidity and Cash Flow

Liquidity
refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from
its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of
safety.  Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities
are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash
flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested
assets.  Our operating activities provided cash of $937 million, $1.3
billion and $2.0 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  When
considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between
the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company,
LNC.  As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives
its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.

The
sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of
dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company
short-term investments, bank lines of credit, a commercial paper program and the
ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf
registration statement.  These sources of liquidity and cash flow
support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common
and preferred stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable
securities, securities repurchases, repayment of preferred stock, acquisitions
and investment in core businesses.  Our cash flows associated with
collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market
value of the underlying derivative contract changes.  As the value of
a derivative asset declines (or increases), the collateral required to be posted
by our counterparties would also decline (or increase).  Likewise,
when the value of a derivative liability declines (or increases), the collateral
we are required to post for our counterparties’ benefit would also decline (or
increase).  During 2009, our payables for collateral on derivative
investments declined by $2.2 billion as improvements in equity and credit
markets resulted in reduced derivative fair values.  For additional
information see “Credit Risk” in Note 6.


The
disruptions in the capital markets experienced in the second half of 2008
continued into the first part of 2009.  During this extraordinary
market environment, management continually monitored and adjusted its liquidity
and capital plans for LNC and its subsidiaries in light of changing needs and
opportunities.  To strengthen the capital position of our principal
insurance subsidiaries and provide holding company liquidity during this period
of volatility in the capital and credit markets, we reduced the common stock
dividend, sold certain subsidiaries, issued common stock and debt during the
second quarter of 2009, issued preferred stock and a common stock warrant to the
U.S. Treasury under the TARP CPP during the third quarter of 2009 and issued
debt during the fourth quarter of 2009, which is discussed in more detail below
in “Financing Activities.”

We
believe that the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they
apply to the U.S. life insurance sector and may adjust upward the capital and
other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of
certain ratings levels.  In addition, actions we take to access third
party financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our
ratings.  For more information about ratings, see “Part I – Item 1.
Business – Ratings.”

Details
underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions)
were as follows:

The table

effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and
retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management

in a modest impact on net cash flows at the holding company.  Also
excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on
short-term investments of the holding company.  See “Part IV – Item
15(a)(2) Financial Statement Schedules – Schedule II – Condensed Financial
Information of Registrant” for the parent company cash flow
statement.


Dividends
from Subsidiaries

Our
insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory
restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding
company.  Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance
subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends
to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the
“Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the
Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends
paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months exceed the statutory
limitation.  The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of
the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement
on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from
operations for the prior calendar year.  As discussed in “Part I –
Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation” above, we may not consider
the benefit from the statutory accounting principles relating to our insurance
subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets in calculating available
dividends.  Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to
disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits.  New
York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln
Life & Annuity Co. of New York, has similar restrictions, except that in New
York it is the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the
immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the
immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital
gains.

We expect
our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $730
million in 2010 without prior approval from the respective state
commissioners.  The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries
could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to
maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk
protection and for future investment in our businesses.

We
maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and
maturities.  These investments are subject to general credit,
liquidity, market and interest rate risks.  An extended disruption in
the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’
ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that
additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in
the current market environment.  In addition, further OTTI could
reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower RBC ratios and potentially
reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries’
Statutory Reserving and Surplus

For
discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and XXX
statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with
secondary guarantees subject to these statutory reserving requirements on our
insurance subsidiaries, see “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance
Solutions – Life Insurance – Income from Operations – Strategies to Address
Statutory Reserve Strain.”

As
mentioned above in “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life
Insurance,” we transferred a closed block of life insurance policies to a third
party effective March 31, 2009.  The transaction resulted in the
release of approximately $240 million of statutory capital previously supporting
this business, which consisted of certain UL and VUL insurance products, and an
RBC benefit of approximately 20 percentage points in 2009.  During the
fourth quarter of 2009, we executed a separate agreement whereby we assumed the
mortality risk associated with this business on a yearly-renewable basis, which
resulted in a higher allocation of capital supporting this business of
approximately $20 million.

As a
result of recent financing activities discussed below and upon the closing of
the TARP CPP, we contributed $1.0 billion to our principal life insurance
subsidiary during 2009.  In addition, we contributed our media
properties’ net assets to our principal life insurance subsidiary during 2009,
which initially increased our statutory capital by $285 million; however, this
initial contribution was impacted primarily by goodwill and FCC license
impairment of $109 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  See
“Critical Accounting Policies – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for more
information.

In
September of 2008, the NAIC adopted a new statutory reserving standard for
variable annuities, VACARVM, which became effective on December 31,
2009, for all existing and future business.  This reserving
standard replaced the previous statutory reserving practices for
variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, and any change in reserving
practices has the potential to increase or decrease statutory
reserves from previous levels.  The effect of the
adoption was dependent upon several factors that existed as of December 31,
2009, including account values, market conditions, the carrying value of
derivative and other assets (whose change in value may be uncorrelated with the
new reserving requirements) as compared to the carrying value of
the reserves they supported and the use of captive or third-party
reinsurance.


The
actual impact of adoption was relatively neutral to RBC ratios and future
dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries with a slight decrease in
statutory reserves offset by a higher capital requirement.  However,
we funded our captive reinsurance subsidiary to support the reserve credit needs
of LNL as a result of the adoption of VACARVM.  Future
market conditions will greatly influence the ultimate capital required due
to its effect on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging
these reserves.  For example, if the level of the S&P 500 had been
10% lower as of December 31, 2009, we estimate that our RBC ratios
would have declined by approximately 5-15% of RBC, the result of either
lower capital levels in our insurance subsidiaries or funding the capital
position of the captive.  Likewise, if the level of the S&P 500
had been 10% higher as of December 31, 2009, we estimate that our
capital would have increased by an amount consistent with an increase of
5-15% of RBC, primarily as a higher level of capital in our captive with little
impact to RBC ratios in our insurance subsidiaries.  However, the
magnitude of such sensitivities could vary significantly depending on
a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, contract holder activity,
hedge positions, changes in interest rates and the rate or volatility of market
movements.  In addition, a movement in the equity markets subsequent to
December 31, 2009, may result in significantly different RBC outcomes. 
We continue to analyze the use of existing captive reinsurance
structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements,
and our current hedging strategies relative to managing the effects of
equity markets and interest rates on the statutory reserves, statutory capital
and the dividend capacity of our life insurance subsidiaries.

Statutory
reserves established for variable annuity contracts and riders are sensitive to
changes in the equity markets.  The impact on statutory reserves
is affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any
guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements, and therefore result in
non-linear relationships between reserve changes and equity market performance
during any reporting period.

A
reduction in LNL’s surplus resulting from increased variable
annuity statutory reserves related to equity market declines may
impact its RBC ratio and its dividend paying capacity.  The RBC ratio is an
important factor in the determination of the credit and financial strength
ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries.  For a discussion of RBC ratios,
see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation – Risk-Based
Capital.”

In
addition, declines in equity markets lower the value of our variable
annuity separate accounts and our credit-linked notes.  When our
separate account assets or our credit-linked notes become less than the
related liabilities, we must allocate additional capital to fund the
difference.

Financing
Activities

Although
our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our
normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to
maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth,
acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.

We
currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to
issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred
stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units,
depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated
trusts.

On
December 11, 2009, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million aggregate
principal amount of our 6.25% senior notes due 2020.  We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering to repay at maturity the $250 million
floating rate senior notes due on March 12, 2010, and for general corporate
purposes.

On
January 4, 2010, we closed on the sale of Delaware and received after-tax
proceeds of approximately $405 million that will be reinvested back into core
insurance businesses.  There could be post-closing adjustments, some
of which are beyond our control, and no assurance can be given as to the timing
of its completion as an extension beyond 120 days is allowed in the purchase
agreement if there is disagreement during this period.  On October 1,
2009, we closed on the sale of Lincoln UK and received after-tax proceeds of
$307 million that will be used for general corporate purposes.  There
could be post-closing adjustments, some of which are beyond our control, and no
assurance can be given as to the timing of its completion as an extension beyond
120 days is allowed in the share purchase agreement if there is disagreement
during this period.  For more information on the disposition of these
businesses, see “Acquisitions and Dispositions” and Note 3.

On July
10, 2009, we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury 950,000 shares of Series B
preferred stock together with a related warrant to purchase up to 13,049,451
shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.92 per share, in
accordance with the terms of the TARP CPP, for an aggregate purchase price of
$950 million.  Holders of this Series B preferred stock are entitled
to a cumulative cash dividend at the annual rate per share of 5% of the
liquidation preference, $1,000 per share, or $48 million annually, for the first
five years from issuance.  After July 10, 2014, if the preferred
shares are still outstanding, the annual dividend rate will increase to 9% per
year.  We intend to repay this financing prior to the increase in the
dividend rate, taking into consideration appropriate balance sheet strength and
capital market conditions.  The Series B non-voting preferred stock
has no maturity date and ranks senior to our common stock.  The Series
B preferred stock dividends and related accretion of discount is recorded as a
direct reduction to retained earnings and deducted from income available to
common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share.  See
Note 15 for additional details.


On June
22, 2009, we closed on the issuance and sale of 40 million shares of our common
stock at a price to the public of $15.00 per share, and we also completed the
issuance and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.75% senior
notes due 2019.  On June 25, 2009, we closed on the issuance and sale
of 6 million additional shares of our common stock at a price of $15.00 per
share to the underwriters who exercised their over-allotment
option.  The net proceeds from these offerings were approximately $1.1
billion.

As
mentioned above, we contributed $1.0 billion of the proceeds of recent financing
activities to our principal insurance subsidiary, LNL, during the third quarter
of 2009, and we retained the remaining amount at the holding company for general
corporate purposes.

Details
underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as
follows:

(1)

Includes
      the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification
      of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of
      discounts and (amortization) of
premiums.

On April
6, 2009, we funded the maturity of a $500 million floating rate senior note
through dividends received during the second quarter of 2009 from LNL and LNBAR
and internal borrowings.  We expect to repay the $250 million floating
rate senior note due on March 12, 2010, with the majority of our proceeds from
our $300 million 6.25% senior offering in December 2009.  We also have
a $250 million 6.2% fixed rate senior note maturing on December 15,
2011.  The specific resources or combination of resources that we will
use to meet the 2011 maturity will depend upon, among other things, the
financial market conditions present at the time of maturity.  As of
December 31, 2009, the holding company had $990 million in cash and cash
equivalents.

In March
of 2009, we repurchased $87 million of our capital securities and recognized a
gain of $64 million, pre-tax.  See Note 13 for additional information
on the gain recognized on the early extinguishment of debt.


Details
underlying our credit facilities with a group of domestic and foreign banks (in
millions) were as follows:

(1)

Our
      borrowing capacity under this credit facility does not have an expiration
      date and continues while our investment in the FHLBI common stock remains
      outstanding as long as LNL maintains a satisfactory level of
      creditworthiness and does not incur a material adverse change in its
      financial, business, regulatory or other areas that would materially
      affect its operations and viability.  Of the borrowings
      outstanding as of December 31, 2009, $250 million is classified within
      long-term debt and $100 million is classified within payables for
      collateral on investments on our Consolidated Balance
      Sheets.  The maturity dates of the borrowings are discussed
      below.

The LOCs
support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated
with our business sold through reinsurance.  LOCs are used primarily
to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of our domestic insurance companies
for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated offshore reinsurance
company, as discussed above, and our domestic clients of the business sold
through reinsurance.

Under the
credit agreements, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth
level.  In addition, the agreements contain covenants restricting our
ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are
not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our
assets.  As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such
covenants.  All of our credit agreements are unsecured.

If
current debt ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future,
terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively
impact overall liquidity.  For the majority of our counterparties,
there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC drop below
BBB-/Baa3.  Our long-term debt currently holds a rating of
BBB/Baa2.  In addition, contractual selling agreements with
intermediaries could be negatively impacted, which could have an adverse impact
on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment
products.  See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A decrease in the
capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to
our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk
Factors –

A
downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to
market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered
and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” for more
information.  See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” for additional
information on our current bond ratings.

In the
third quarter of 2008, LNL made an investment of $19 million in the FHLBI, a
AAA-rated entity, and made an additional investment of $2 million in the second
quarter of 2009.  We are allowed to borrow up to 20 times the amount
of our common stock investment in the FHLBI.  All borrowings from the
FHLBI are required to be secured by certain investments owned by
LNL.  On December 4, 2008, the LNC and LNL Boards of Directors
approved an additional common stock investment of $56 million, which would
increase our total borrowing capacity up to $1.5 billion upon completion of that
incremental investment.  As of December 31, 2009, based on our actual
common stock investment, we had borrowing capacity of up to approximately $411
million from the FHLBI.  We had a $250 million floating-rate term loan
outstanding under the facility due June 20, 2017, which may be prepaid beginning
June 20, 2010.  During the second quarter of 2009, we also borrowed
$100 million at a rate of 0.8% that is due June 3, 2010.


Management
monitors the covenants associated with LNC’s capital securities.  If we
fail to meet capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels
(also referred to as “trigger events”), terms in the agreements may be
triggered, which would require us to make interest payments in accordance with
an “alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism.”  This would require us
to use commercially reasonable efforts to pay interest in full on the capital
securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants on
our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price.  We
would have to utilize the alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism until the
trigger events above no longer existed.  If we were required to utilize the
alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism and were successful in selling
sufficient common shares or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would
dilute the current holders of our common stock.  Furthermore, while a
trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in
full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital
stock.  For more information, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – We
will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from
the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve capital adequacy or
net income and stockholders’ equity levels.”

Alternative
Sources of Liquidity

In order
to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management
program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding
company to meet short-term borrowing needs.  The cash management
program is essentially a series of demand loans, which are permitted under
applicable insurance laws, among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall
borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal
resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs.  For our
Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is
currently the lesser of 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets and 25% of
its surplus, in both cases, as of its most recent year end.

The
holding company had an average borrowing balance of $174 million from the cash
management program during 2009.  The holding company had a maximum and
minimum amount of financing that is used from the cash management program during
this period of $603 million and $0, respectively.  There was no
balance as of December 31, 2009.  In addition, the holding company had
an outstanding payable of $97 million to certain subsidiaries resulting
from amounts placed by the subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management
account in excess of funds borrowed by those subsidiaries as of December
31, 2009.  Any increase (decrease) in either of these holding company cash
management program payable balances results in an immediate and equal increase
(decrease) to holding company cash and cash equivalents.

Our
insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income
investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs
and repurchase agreements.  As of December 31, 2009, our insurance
subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $501 million out on loan
under the securities lending program and $344 million carrying value subject to
reverse-repurchase agreements.  The cash received in our securities
lending program is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term
investments or fixed maturity securities.

LNC has a
$1.0 billion commercial paper program that is rated A-2, P-2 and
F2.  The commercial paper program is backed by a bank line of
credit.  During 2009, LNC had an average of $314 million in commercial
paper outstanding with a maximum amount of $776 million outstanding at any
time.  LNC had $99 million of commercial paper outstanding as of
December 31, 2009.

For
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking
Statements – Cautionary Language” above.

Divestitures

discussion of our divestitures, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Acquisitions
and Dispositions” and Note 3.

Uses
of Capital

Our
principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating
expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase
reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our
stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.

Return
of Capital to Common Stockholders

One of
the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders
through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases.  In
determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current
and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and
requirements for financial flexibility.  As a result of our
participation in the TARP CPP, we are subject to limits on increasing the
dividend on our common stock (unless the U.S. Treasury consents), which applies
until the third anniversary of the U.S. Treasury’s investment, unless we redeem
the Series B preferred shares in whole or the U.S. Treasury transfers all of the
Series B preferred stock to third parties.

On
February 24, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a reduction of the dividend
on our common stock from $0.21 to $0.01 per share, which, along with a prior
reduction, is expected to add approximately $100 million to capital each
quarter.  Additionally, we have suspended stock repurchase
activity.  We expect that both of these changes will favorably impact
our capital position prospectively in light of the market volatility and
extraordinary events that affected financial markets in late 2008 and early
2009.

Other
Uses of Capital

In
addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common
Stockholders,” uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as

The above

net cash flows at the holding company.

      various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities
      including single premium immediate annuities, group pension annuities,
      guaranteed interest contracts, structured settlements, pension closeouts
      and certain annuity contracts.  Future contract benefits and
      other contract holder obligations also include benefit and claim
      liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and
      contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not
      result in any future payment obligation.  For these policies and
      contracts, we are not currently making payments and will not make payments
      in the future until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or
      disability; or the occurrence of a payment triggering event, such as a
      surrender of a policy or contract, which is outside of our
      control.  We have made significant assumptions to determine the
      estimated undiscounted cash flows of these policies and contracts, which
      include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates and interest crediting
      rates.  Future contract benefits and other contract holder
      obligations have been calculated using a discount rate of
      6%.  Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the
      amounts presented could materially differ from actual
    results.

Includes
      the maturities of the principal amounts of long-term debt, but excludes
      other items such as unamortized premiums and discounts and fair value
      hedges, which are included in long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance
      Sheets.

Includes
      a maximum annual increase related to the Consumer Price

(5)

Includes
      anticipated funding for benefit payments for our retirement and
      postretirement plans through 2019 and known payments under deferred
      compensation arrangements.

In
addition to the contractual commitments outlined in the table above, we
periodically fund the employees’ defined benefit plans.  We
contributed $11 million, $14 million and $10 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, to U.S. pension plans; $44 million, $2 million and $1 million in
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to our U.K. pension plan; and $16 million,
$15 million and $14 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to our
postretirement plan.  We do not expect to contribute to our qualified
U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2010.  We expect to fund
approximately $10 million to our unfunded non-qualified U.S. defined benefit
plan and $10 million to our postretirement benefit plans during
2010.  These amounts include anticipated benefit payments for
non-qualified plans.  The majority of contributions/benefit payments
are made at the insurance company subsidiary level with little holding company
cash flow impact.  See Note 18 for additional
information.

Due to
the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with
our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2009, we are unable to make
reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the
respective taxing authority.  Therefore, $412 million of unrecognized
tax benefits and its associated interest have been excluded from the contractual
obligations table above.  See Note 7 for additional
information.


Contingencies
and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a
material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or

Pension
Contributions

Based on
our calculations, we are not currently required to make any 2010 contributions;
however, if plan assets were to decline as a result of unfavorable equity
markets, we might be required to make contributions in order to meet the
requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Worker, Retiree
and Employer Recovery Act of 2008.

Significant
Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow

As stated
above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the
dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability
to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may
be impacted by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory
earnings performance.  As a result of the raising of capital discussed
in “Financing Activities” above, we currently expect to be able to meet the
holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer
downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience
another period of extreme volatility and disruption.  These actions
compliment the previously mentioned dividend reductions, suspension of share
repurchases and enterprise-wide restructuring program that is expected to
generate $140 million to $160 million, after-tax, in annual savings to further
strengthen our capital and liquidity positions.  In addition, we are
exploring our options with regard to protecting and building capital at the
insurance company subsidiaries, which may include, depending on then current
market conditions and other factors, potential securitizations of reserves,
reinsurance transactions and sales of corporate assets.  A
continuation of or an acceleration of poor capital market conditions, which
reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them
to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the
holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional
capital.  For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity
and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

OTHER
MATTERS

Other
Factors Affecting Our Business

In
general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal,
legislative and regulatory environment.  Some of the changes include
initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance
subsidiaries.  Although the eventual effect on us of the changing
environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others
could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital
resources.  For factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk
Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language”
above.

Item
7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

We
analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial
instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management
process that takes diversification into account.  By aggregating the
potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we
estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and
shareholder value.  We have exposures to several market risks
including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market
risk, default risk, basis risk and credit risk.  The exposures of
financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management
processes, are most important to our Retirement Solutions and Insurance
Solutions businesses, where most of the invested assets support accumulation and
investment-oriented insurance products.  As an important element of
our integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to
minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield
curve, currency movements and volatility.  In this context, derivatives are
designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the
effect of significant increases in interest rates on our
earnings.  Additional market exposures exist in our other general
account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives
positions.  Our primary sources of market risk
are:  substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or
decreases in interest rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; or a sharp
drop in equity market values.  These market risks are discussed in
detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with, our
consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated
financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Part II – Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data,” as well as “Part II – Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(“MD&A”).

Interest Rate Risk

With
respect to accumulation and investment-oriented products, we seek to earn a
stable and profitable spread, or margin, between investment income we earn on
our invested assets and interest credited to account values of our contract
holders.  If we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be
passed on to customers, our spreads are reduced.  Provided investment
yields and default experience continue to gradually return to levels that
are more typical from a long-term perspective, we do not view the near term risk
to spreads over the next twelve months to be material.  The
combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve
months, asset-liability management strategies, flexibility in adjusting policy
crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and
other switching costs all work together to mitigate this risk.  The
interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial,
relatively prolonged decrease in interest rates that is sustained over a long
period or a rapid increase in interest rates.


Significant
Interest Rate Exposures

The
following provides a general measure of our significant interest rate risk;

Interest
Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates

The
spreads on our fixed annuity, term life, whole life, interest-sensitive whole
life, universal life (“UL”), fixed portion of defined contribution business and
fixed portion of variable universal life (“VUL”) insurance policies are at risk
if interest rates decline and remain low for a period of time, which has
generally been the case in recent years.  Should interest rates remain
at current levels that are significantly lower than those existing prior to the
declines of recent years, the average earned rate of return on our annuity and
UL investment portfolios will continue to decline.  Declining
portfolio yields may cause the spreads between investment portfolio yields and
the interest rate credited to contract holders to deteriorate as our ability to
manage spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL
policies.  Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies
generally range from 1.5% to 5.0%.  The following provides detail on
the percentage differences between the December 31, 2009, interest rates being
credited to contract holders and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate
(dollars in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported
within the Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses:

(1)

Contracts
      currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the
      corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first
      anniversary.

The
maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured
to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during
periods of declining interest rates.  We devote extensive effort to
evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset
and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate
scenarios.  We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a
suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each
respective investment portfolio.


Interest
Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Rising Rates

For both
annuities and UL, a rapid rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating
spreads and high surrenders.  The portfolios supporting these products
have fixed-rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to
ten years or more.  Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio
lags behind changes in market yields.  As rates rise, the lag may be
increased by slowing mortgage-backed securities prepayments.  The
greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will
tend to lag behind market rates.  If we set renewal crediting rates to
earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and
competitors’ new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders
that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these
surrenders.  If we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit
surrenders, our spreads will narrow.  We devote extensive effort to
evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide
range of interest rate scenarios.  Such analysis has led to
adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising
rates by buying out-of-the-money interest rate cap agreements and
swaptions.  With these instruments in place, the potential adverse
impact of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk
tolerances.

Debt

We manage
the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt as
part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the
entire enterprise.  See Note 13 for additional information on our
debt.

Derivatives

We have
entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in
interest rates.  The derivative programs are used to help us achieve
somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract
holders during periods when interest rates are changing.  Such
derivatives include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate
caps and treasury locks.  See Note 6 for additional information on our
derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest
rates.

In
addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in
other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the
management of investment spread businesses.  We have established
policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives
as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our
operations.  Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives
policy.


Foreign
Currency Exchange Risk

Foreign
Currency Denominated Investments

We invest
in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification
relative to United States Dollar-Denominated (“USD”) securities.  We
use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the
foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in
foreign currencies.  The currency risk is hedged using foreign
currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds.  See Note 6
for additional information on our foreign currency swaps and foreign currency
forwards used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange
risk.

The
following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents
of our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps (in
millions):


Equity
Market Risk

Our
revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market
risk.  Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and
our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in
the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly
earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”),
value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and
deferred front-end sales loads (“DFEL”).  However, there is an impact
to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and
assets under management and the related fees we earn on those
assets.  Refer to our “Item 7. MD&A – Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for further discussion on the impact of
equity markets on our RTM.

Fee
Revenues

The fees
earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed
to the risk of a decline in equity market values.  These fees are
generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under
management.  In a severe equity market decline, fee income could be
reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals
and redemptions.  Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds
and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed-income accounts
and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors’ customers.

Assets

While we
invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than
would be available in our core fixed-income investments, the returns on and
values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk
than our fixed-income investments.  These investments, however, add
diversification benefits to our fixed-income investments.  The
following provides the sensitivity of price changes (in millions) to our equity
assets owned and equity derivatives:

(1)

Assumes
      a plus or minus 10% change in underlying indexes.  Estimated
      fair value does not reflect daily settlement of futures or monthly
      settlement of total return swaps.


Liabilities

We have
exposure to changes in our stock price through stock appreciation rights
(“SARs”) issued in 2005 through 2009.  See Note 6 and Note 20 for
additional information on our SARs and the related call options used to hedge
the expected increase in liabilities from SARs granted on our
stock.

Derivatives
Hedging Equity Market Risk

We have
entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to equity market
fluctuations.  Such derivatives include over-the-counter equity call
options, equity collars, variance swaps, total return swaps, put options, equity
futures and call options.  See Note 6 for additional information on
our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to equity market
fluctuations.

Impact
of Equity Market Sensitivity

Due to
the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies as described in “MD&A
– Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” we expect that, in general,
short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant
impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA,
DSI and DFEL, as we do not unlock our long-term equity market assumptions based
upon short-term fluctuations in the equity markets.  However, there is
an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account
values and assets under management and the related asset-based fees we earn on
those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of
assets.  The following table presents our estimate of the impact on
income from operations (in millions), from the change in asset-based fees and
related expenses, if the level of the S&P 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) were to
drop to 1000 immediately after December 31, 2009, and remaining at that level
through the next twelve months or dropped to 800 immediately after December 31,
2009, and remain at that level through the next twelve months, excluding any
impact related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program
performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market
change:

If
      the level of the S&P 500 dropped to 800 immediately after December 31,
      2009, and remained at that level in subsequent periods, we project that we
      would have an RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $200 million to
      $240 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions late in
      2012.  If the level of the S&P 500 dropped to 1000
      immediately after December 31, 2009, and remained at that
      level  in subsequent periods, we project that we would have an
      RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $125 million to $165 million,
      after-tax, for Retirement Solutions late in
  2014.

(2)

The
      baseline for these impacts assumes 9% annual equity market growth
      beginning on January 1, 2010.  The baseline is then compared to
      scenarios of S&P 500 at the 800 and 1000 levels, which assume the
      index stays at those levels for the next twelve months and grows at 9%
      annually thereafter.  The difference between the baseline and
      S&P 500 at the 800 and 1000 level scenarios is presented in the
      table.

The
impact on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the next twelve
months.  The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee
revenues and asset-based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current
quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based
upon daily variable account values.  The difference between the
current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of
period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent
periods.  Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be
symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets.  This
discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility
on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended
to be illustrative.  Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of
factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer
behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between
variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives
available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or
changes in policy persistency.  For purposes of this guidance, the
change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant
index.


Default
Risk

Our
portfolio of invested assets was $75.9 billion and $66.5 billion as of December
31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively.  Of this total, $47.2
billion and $37.7 billion consisted of corporate bonds and $7.2 billion and $7.7
billion consist of commercial mortgages as of December 31, 2009, and December
31, 2008, respectively.  We manage the risk of adverse default
experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and
underwriting standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower-quality,
higher-yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry,
region and property type.  For each counterparty or borrowing entity
and its affiliates, our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and
managed in relation to formal limits set by rating
quality.  Additional diversification limits, such as limits per
industry, are also applied.  We remain exposed to occasional adverse
cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly
higher than the long-term historical average used in pricing.

We depend
on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their
obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives
agreements.  In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we
diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure
to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its
guarantor.  We generally limit our selection of counterparties that
are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an A credit rating
or above.

Credit-Related
Derivatives

We use
credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and
we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract
holders.  For additional information see Note 6.

Credit Risk

By using
derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit risk (our counterparty fails to
make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument
falls).  When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive,
this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a
credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the
derivative.  When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative,
this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit
risk, but have been affected by market risk.  We minimize the credit
risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality
counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by
limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty, and by requiring
certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain
limits.  We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative
contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(“ISDA”) Master Agreement.  We do not believe that the credit or
market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any
insurance subsidiary or to us.

We have
derivative positions with counterparties.  Assuming zero recovery
value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions
with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty
were to default.  As of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, our
counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $292 million and $562
million, respectively.  We have exposure to 15 counterparties, with a
maximum exposure of $135 million, net of collateral, to a single
counterparty.  The credit risk associated with such agreements is
minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with
long-standing, superior performance records.  For the majority of LNC
counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of
LNC rating drop below BBB-/Baa3.  Additionally, we maintain a policy
of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master
Agreement.

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT
      REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
  REPORTING

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for LNC to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.  Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting effectiveness to future periods are
subject to risks.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with
policies or procedures.

Management
assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
the end of our fiscal year.  Management based its assessment on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.  Management’s assessment included evaluation of such
elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting
controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control
environment.

Based on
the assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2009, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included immediately
below.


Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board
of Directors and Shareholders of

Lincoln
National Corporation

We have
audited Lincoln National Corporation’s (the “Corporation”) internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).  The
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, Lincoln National Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
based on the COSO criteria.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Lincoln
National Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 and our report dated
February 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board
of Directors and Shareholders of

Lincoln
National Corporation

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lincoln National
Corporation (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2009.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the Index at 15(a)(2).  These financial statements and
schedules are the responsibility of the Corporation's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Lincoln National Corporation at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2009 the
Corporation changed its method of accounting for the recognition and
presentation of other-than-temporary impairments.  Also, as discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2008 the Corporation
changed its method of accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets
and financial liabilities.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), Lincoln National Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2010
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

LINCOLN
NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Nature
of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Nature of
Operations

Lincoln
National Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (“LNC” or the
“Company,” which also may be referred to as “we,” “our” or “us”) operate
multiple insurance businesses through four business segments.  See
Note 23 for additional details.  The collective group of businesses
uses “Lincoln Financial Group” as its marketing identity.  Through our
business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and
retirement income products.  These products include institutional
and/or retail fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life
(“UL”) insurance, variable universal life (“VUL”) insurance, term life insurance
and mutual funds.

Basis
of Presentation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
United States of America generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”).  Certain GAAP policies, which significantly affect the
determination of financial position, results of operations and cash flows, are
summarized below.

Certain
amounts reported in prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current
year.  These reclassifications had no effect on net income or
stockholders’ equity of the prior years.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LNC and
all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest and any
variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which we are the primary
beneficiary.  Entities in which we do not have a controlling financial
interest and do not exercise significant management influence over the operating
and financing decisions are reported using the equity method.  The
carrying value of our investments that we account for using the equity method on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets and equity in earnings on our Consolidated
Statements of Income (Loss) is not material.  All material
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  See Note 4 for additional discussion on our
VIEs.

Accounting
Estimates and Assumptions

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses for the reporting period.  Those estimates are inherently
subject to change and actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Included among the material (or potentially material)
reported amounts and disclosures that require extensive use of estimates
are:  fair value of certain invested assets and derivatives, asset
valuation allowances, deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business
acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), goodwill, future contract
benefits, other contract holder funds which includes deferred front-end loads
(“DFEL”), pension plans, income taxes and the potential effects of resolving
litigated matters.

Business
Combinations

For all
business combination transactions occurring after January 1, 2009, we use the
acquisition method of accounting.  For more detail on the acquisition
method, see Note 2 – “Adoption of New Accounting Standards – Business
Combinations Topic.”  For all business combination transactions
initiated after June 30, 2001, but before January 1, 2009, the purchase method
of accounting has been used, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the
acquired company have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the
merger date.  The allocation of fair values may be subject to
adjustment after the initial allocation for up to a one-year period as more
information relative to the fair values as of the acquisition date becomes
available.  The consolidated financial statements include the results
of operations of any acquired company since the acquisition
date.


Fair
Value Hierarchy

Our
measurement of fair value is based on assumptions used by market participants in
pricing the asset or liability, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on
the sale or use of an asset or non-performance risk, which would include our own
credit risk.  Our estimate of an exchange price is the price in an
orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer
the liability (“exit price”) in the principal market, or the most advantageous
market in the absence of a principal market, for that asset or liability, as
opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or receive a
liability (“entry price”).  Pursuant to the Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, we categorize our financial instruments
carried at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the
priority of inputs to the respective valuation technique.  The
three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined as
follows:

·

Level
      1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in
      active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date as
      “blockage discounts” for large holdings of unrestricted financial
      instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available for an
      identical asset or liability in an active market are
      prohibited;

·

Level
      2 – inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in
      active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of
      the reporting date, and fair value can be determined through the use of
      models or other valuation methodologies;
and

·

Level
      3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs in
      situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or
      liability, we make estimates and assumptions related to the pricing of the
      asset or liability, including assumptions regarding
  risk.

In
certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different
levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, an investment’s
level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that
is significant to the fair value measurement.  Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment.

When a
determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy, the determination is based upon the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.  Because
certain securities trade in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no
pricing information, the determination of fair value for these securities is
inherently more difficult.  However, Level 3 fair value investments
may include, in addition to the unobservable or Level 3 inputs, observable
components, which are components that are actively quoted or can be validated to
market-based sources.

Available-For-Sale
Securities – Fair Valuation Methodologies and Associated Inputs

Securities
classified as available-for-sale (“AFS”) consist of fixed maturity and equity
securities and are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), net of
associated DAC, VOBA, DSI, other contract holder funds and deferred income
taxes.  See Notes 5 and 15 for additional details.

We
measure the fair value of our securities classified as AFS based on assumptions
used by market participants in pricing the security.  The most
appropriate valuation methodology is selected based on the specific
characteristics of the fixed maturity or equity security, and we consistently
apply the valuation methodology to measure the security’s fair
value.  Our fair value measurement is based on a market approach,
which utilizes prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable securities.  Sources of
inputs to the market approach include third-party pricing services, independent
broker quotations or pricing matrices.  We use observable and
unobservable inputs to our valuation methodologies.  Observable inputs
include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads,
two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference
data.  In addition, market indicators, industry and economic events
are monitored and further market data is acquired if certain triggers are
met. For certain security types, additional inputs may be used, or some of
the inputs described above may not be applicable.  For broker-quoted
only securities, quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from
sources recognized to be market participants. In order to validate the
pricing information and broker-dealer quotes, we employ, where possible,
procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions,
comparisons with subsequent sales, discussions with senior business leaders and
brokers and observations of general market movements for those security
classes.  For those securities trading in less liquid or illiquid
markets with limited or no pricing information, we use unobservable inputs in
order to measure the fair value of these securities.  In cases where
this information is not available, such as for privately placed securities, fair
value is estimated using an internal pricing matrix.  This matrix
relies on management’s judgment concerning the discount rate used in calculating
expected future cash flows, credit quality, industry sector performance and
expected maturity.

We do not
adjust prices received from third parties; however, we do analyze the
third-party pricing services’ valuation methodologies and related inputs and
perform additional evaluation to determine the appropriate level within the fair
value hierarchy.


The
observable and unobservable inputs to our valuation methodologies are based on a
set of standard inputs that we generally use to evaluate all of our AFS
securities.  The standard inputs used in order of priority are
benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads,
two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference
data.  Depending on the type of security or the daily market activity,
standard inputs may be prioritized differently or may not be available for all
AFS securities on any given day.  In addition to the defined standard
inputs to our valuation methodologies, we also use Trade Reporting and
Compliance Engine

TM

reported tables for our corporate bonds and vendor trading platform data for our
U.S. Government bonds.  Mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) and
asset-backed securities (“ABS”) utilize additional inputs which include new
issues data, monthly payment information and monthly collateral performance,
including prepayments, severity, delinquencies, step down features and over
collateralization features.  The valuation methodologies for our state
and municipal bonds use additional inputs which include information from the
Municipal Securities Rule Making Board, as well as material event notices, new
issue data, issuer financial statements and Municipal Market Data benchmark
yields.  Our hybrid and redeemable preferred stocks and equity AFS
securities utilize additional inputs of exchange prices (underlying and common
stock of the same issuer).

AFS
Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost

We
regularly review our AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine
to be other-than-temporary.  For an equity security, if we do not have
the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to
allow for a recovery in value, we conclude that an other-than-temporary
impairment (“OTTI”) has occurred and the amortized cost of the equity security
is written down to the current fair value, with a corresponding charge to
realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss).  When assessing our ability and intent to hold the equity
security to recovery, we consider, among other things, the severity and duration
of the decline in fair value of the equity security as well as the cause of the
decline, a fundamental analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall
financial condition of the issuer.

For our
fixed maturity AFS securities, we generally consider the following to determine
that our unrealized losses are not OTTI:

·

The
      estimated range and average period until
  recovery;

·

The
      estimated range and average holding period to
  maturity;

·

Remaining
      payment terms of the security;

·

Current
      delinquencies and nonperforming assets of underlying
      collateral;

·

Expected
      future default rates;

·

Collateral
      value by vintage, geographic region, industry concentration or property
      type;

·

Subordination
      levels or other credit enhancements as of the balance sheet date as
      compared to origination; and

·

Contractual
      and regulatory cash obligations.

For a
debt security, if we intend to sell a security or it is more likely than not we
will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost
basis and the fair value of the debt security is below amortized cost, we
conclude that an OTTI has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to
current fair value, with a corresponding charge to realized gain (loss) on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).  If we do not intend to sell
a debt security or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a
debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis but the present value
of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of
the debt security (referred to as the credit loss), we conclude that an OTTI has
occurred and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value
with a corresponding charge to realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated
Statements of Income (Loss), as this amount is deemed the credit portion of the
OTTI.  The remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded in OCI
to unrealized OTTI on AFS securities on our Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity, as this amount is considered a noncredit (i.e.,
recoverable) impairment.

When
assessing our intent to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not we
will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its cost basis, we
evaluate facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to
reposition our security portfolio, sale of securities to meet cash flow needs
and sales of securities to capitalize on favorable pricing.  In order
to determine the amount of the credit loss for a debt security, we calculate the
recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the
current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover.  The
discount rate is the effective interest rate implicit in the underlying debt
security.  The effective interest rate is the original yield or the
coupon if the debt security was previously impaired.  See the
discussion below for additional information on the methodology and significant
inputs, by security type, which we use to determine the amount of a credit
loss.


Our
conclusion that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell
the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis,
the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost
basis of the debt securities, or we have the ability to hold the equity AFS
securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery is based upon our
asset-liability management process.  Management considers the
following as part of the evaluation:

·

The
      current economic environment and market
  conditions;

·

Our
      business strategy and current business
plans;

·

The
      nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to
      general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate
  risk;

·

Our
      analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry
      sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall
      risk management strategies;

·

The
      current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and
      liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations
      for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity
      contracts;

·

The
      capital risk limits approved by management;
and

·

Our
      current financial condition and liquidity
  demands.

To
determine the recovery period of a debt security, we consider the facts and
circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to,
the following:

·

Historic
      and implied volatility of the
security;

·

Length
      of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized
      cost;

·

Adverse
      conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions
      in an industry or geographic area;

·

Failure,
      if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments;
      and

·

Recoveries
      or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet
      date.

In
periods subsequent to the recognition of an OTTI, the AFS security is accounted
for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the
OTTI.  Therefore, for the fixed maturity AFS security, the original
discount or reduced premium is reflected in net investment income over the
contractual term of the investment in a manner that produces a constant
effective yield.

To
determine recovery value of a corporate bond or ABS collateralized debt
obligations (“CDOs”), we perform additional analysis related to the underlying
issuer including, but not limited to, the following:

·

Fundamentals
      of the issuer to determine what we would recover if they were to file
      bankruptcy versus the price at which the market is
  trading;

·

Fundamentals
      of the industry in which the issuer
operates;

·

Earnings
      multiples for the given industry or sector of an industry that the
      underlying issuer operates within, divided by the outstanding debt to
      determine an expected recovery value of the security in the case of a
      liquidation;

·

Expected
      cash flows of the issuer (e.g., whether the issuer has cash flows in
      excess of what is required to fund its
  operations);

·

Expectations
      regarding defaults and recovery
rates;

·

Changes
      to the rating of the security by a rating agency;
  and

·

Additional
      market information (e.g., if there has been a replacement of the corporate
      debt security).

Each
quarter we review the cash flows for the MBS to determine whether or not they
are sufficient to provide for the recovery of our amortized cost.  We
revise our cash flow projections only for those securities that are at most risk
for impairment based on current credit enhancement and trends in the underlying
collateral performance.  To determine recovery value of a MBS, we
perform additional analysis related to the underlying issuer including, but not
limited to, the following:

·

Discounted
      cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows
      we expect to recover;

·

Level
      of creditworthiness of the home equity loans that back a collateralized
      mortgage obligations (“CMO”), residential mortgages that back a mortgage
      pass-through securities (“MPTS”) or commercial mortgages that back a
      commercial MBS (“CMBS”);

·

Susceptibility
      to fair value fluctuations for changes in the interest rate
      environment;

·

Susceptibility
      to reinvestment risks, in cases where market yields are lower than the
      securities’ book yield earned;

·

Susceptibility
      to reinvestment risks, in cases where market yields are higher than the
      book yields earned on a security and our expectations of sale of such a
      security; and

·

Susceptibility
      to variability of prepayments.


When
evaluating MBS and mortgage-related ABS, we consider a number of pool-specific
factors as well as market level factors when determining whether or not the
impairment on the security is temporary or other-than-temporary.  The
most important factor is the performance of the underlying collateral in the
security and the trends of that performance in the prior periods.  We
use this information about the collateral to forecast the timing and rate of
mortgage loan defaults, including making projections for loans that are already
delinquent and for those loans that are currently performing but may become
delinquent in the future.  Other factors used in this analysis include
type of underlying collateral (e.g., prime, Alt-A or subprime), geographic
distribution of underlying loans and timing of liquidations by
state.  Once default rates and timing assumptions are determined, we
then make assumptions regarding the severity of a default if it were to
occur.  Factors that impact the severity assumption include
expectations for future home price appreciation or depreciation, loan size,
first lien versus second lien, existence of loan level private mortgage
insurance, type of occupancy and geographic distribution of
loans.  Once default and severity assumptions are determined for the
security in question, cash flows for the underlying collateral are projected
including expected defaults and prepayments.  These cash flows on the
collateral are then translated to cash flows on our tranche based on the cash
flow waterfall of the entire capital security structure.  If this
analysis indicates the entire principal on a particular security will not be
returned, the security is reviewed for OTTI by comparing the expected cash flows
to amortized cost.  To the extent that the security has already been
impaired or was purchased at a discount, such that the amortized cost of the
security is less than or equal to the present value of cash flows expected to be
collected, no impairment is required.

Otherwise,
if the amortized cost of the security is greater than the present value of the
cash flows expected to be collected, and the security was not purchased at a
discount greater than the expected principal loss, then impairment is
recognized.

We
further monitor the cash flows of all of our AFS securities backed by pools on
an ongoing basis.  We also perform detailed analysis on all of our
subprime, Alt-A, non-agency residential MBS and on a significant percentage of
our AFS securities backed by pools of commercial mortgages.  The
detailed analysis includes revising projected cash flows by updating the cash
flows for actual cash received and applying assumptions with respect to expected
defaults, foreclosures and recoveries in the future.  These revised
projected cash flows are then compared to the amount of credit enhancement
(subordination) in the structure to determine whether the amortized cost of the
security is recoverable.  If it is not recoverable, we record an
impairment of the security.

Trading
Securities

Trading
securities consist of fixed maturity and equity securities in designated
portfolios, some of which support modified coinsurance (“Modco”) and coinsurance
with funds withheld (“CFW”) reinsurance arrangements.  Investment
results for the portfolios that support Modco and CFW reinsurance arrangements,
including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers
pursuant to contractual terms of the reinsurance
arrangements.  Trading securities are carried at fair value and
changes in fair value and changes in the fair value of embedded derivative
liabilities associated with the underlying reinsurance arrangements, are
recorded in realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as
they occur.

Alternative
Investments

Alternative
investments, which consist primarily of investments in Limited Partnerships
(“LPs”), are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  We account for our investments in LPs using the equity method
to determine the carrying value.  Recognition of alternative
investment income is delayed due to the availability of the related financial
statements, as our venture capital, real estate and oil and gas portfolios are
generally on a three-month delay and our hedge funds are on a one-month delay
and are generally obtained from the partnerships’ general
partners.  In addition, the impact of audit adjustments related to
completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of the investees are
typically received during the second quarter of each calendar
year.  Accordingly, our investment income from alternative investments
for any calendar year period may not include the complete impact of the change
in the underlying net assets for the partnership for that calendar year
period.

Payables
for Collateral on Investments

When we
enter into collateralized financing transactions on our investments, a liability
is recorded equal to the cash collateral received.  This liability is
included within payables for collateral on investments on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  Income and expenses associated with these
transactions are recorded as investment income and investment expenses within
net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss).  Changes in payables for collateral on investments are
reflected within cash flows from investing activities on our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.


Credit-Linked
Notes

We earn a
spread between the coupon received on the credit-linked notes (“CLNs”) and the
interest credited on the funding agreements.  Our CLNs were created
using a special purpose trust that combines highly rated assets with credit
default swaps to produce a multi-class structured security.  The high
quality assets in these transactions are AAA-rated ABS secured by a pool of
credit card receivables.  The credit default swaps in the underlying
portfolios are actively managed by the investment manager for the pool of
underlying issuers in each of the transactions, as permitted in the CLN
agreements.  The investment manager, from time to time, has directed
substitutions of corporate names in the reference portfolio.  When
substituting corporate names, the issuing special purpose trust transacts with a
third party to sell credit protection on a new issuer, selected by the
investment manager.  The cost to substitute the corporate names is based on
market conditions and the liquidity of the corporate names.  This new
issuer will replace the issuer the investment manager has identified to remove
from the pool of issuers.  The substitution of corporate issuers does not
revise the CLN agreement.  The subordination and the participation in
credit losses may change as a result of the substitution.  The amount of
the change is dependent upon the relative risk of the issuers removed and
replaced in the pool of issuers.

Consistent
with other debt market instruments, we are exposed to credit losses within the
structure of the CLNs, which could result in principal losses to our
investments.  However, we have attempted to protect our investments
from credit losses through the multi-tiered class structure of the CLN, which
requires the subordinated classes of the investment pool to absorb all of the
credit losses up to the current attachment point.  The Lincoln
National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”) owns the mezzanine tranche of these
investments.

Our
evaluation of the CLNs for OTTI involves projecting defaults in the underlying
collateral pool, making assumptions regarding severity and then comparing losses
on the underlying collateral pool to the amount of subordination.  We
apply current published industry data of projected default rates to the
underlying collateral pool to estimate the expected future losses.  If
expected losses were to exceed the attachment point, we may recognize an OTTI on
the CLN.

Mortgage
Loans on Real Estate

Mortgage
loans on real estate are carried at unpaid principal balances adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts and are net of valuation
allowances.  Interest income is accrued on the principal balance of
the loan based on the loan’s contractual interest rate.  Premiums and
discounts are amortized using the effective yield method over the life of the
loan.  Interest income and amortization of premiums and discounts are
reported in net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss) along with mortgage loan fees, which are recorded as they are
incurred.  Loans are considered impaired when it is probable that,
based upon current information and events, we will be unable to collect all
amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  When
we determine that a loan is impaired, a valuation allowance is established for
the excess carrying value of the loan over its estimated value.  The
loan’s estimated value is based on:  the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s
observable market price, or the fair value of the loan’s
collateral.  Valuation allowances are maintained at a level we believe
is adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses.  Our periodic
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses is based on our past loan
loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations
that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay (including the timing of future
payments), the estimated value of the underlying collateral, composition of the
loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant
factors.  We do not accrue interest on impaired loans and loans 90
days past due, and any interest received on these loans is either applied to the
principal or recorded in net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss) when received, depending on the assessment of the collectibility
of the loan.  Mortgage loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged
against the allowance for losses and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited
to the allowance for losses.  All mortgage loans that are impaired
have an established allowance for credit losses.  Changes in valuation
allowances are reported in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements
of Income (Loss).

Policy
Loans

Policy
loans represent loans we issue to contract holders that use the cash surrender
value of their life insurance policy as collateral.  Policy loans are
carried at unpaid principal balances.


Real
Estate

Real
estate includes both real estate held for the production of income and real
estate held-for-sale.  Real estate held for the production of income
is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the
asset.  We periodically review properties held for the production of
income for impairment.  Properties whose carrying values are greater
than their projected undiscounted cash flows are written down to estimated fair
value, with impairment losses reported in realized gain (loss) on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).  The estimated fair value of
real estate is generally computed using the present value of expected future
cash flows from the real estate discounted at a rate commensurate with the
underlying risks.  Real estate classified as held-for-sale is stated
at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value less expected disposition costs
at the time classified as held-for-sale.  Real estate is not
depreciated while it is classified as held-for-sale.  Also, valuation
allowances for losses are established, as appropriate, for real estate
held-for-sale and any changes to the valuation allowances are reported in
realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss).  Real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings is
recorded at fair value at the settlement date.

Derivative
Instruments

We hedge
certain portions of our exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency
exchange risk, equity market risk and credit risk by entering into derivative
transactions.  All of our derivative instruments are recognized as
either assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at estimated
fair value.  We categorized derivatives into a three-level hierarchy,
based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique as
discussed above in “Fair Value Hierarchy.”  The accounting for changes
in the estimated fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has
been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on
the type of hedging relationship.  For those derivative instruments
that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we must designate the
hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged: as a cash flow hedge, a
fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
subsidiary.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported
as a component of accumulated OCI and reclassified into net income in the same
period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects net
income.  The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in
excess of the cumulative change in the present value of designated future cash
flows of the hedged item (hedge ineffectiveness), if any, is recognized in net
income during the period of change.  For derivative instruments that
are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in net income during the period
of change in estimated fair values.  For derivative instruments that
are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
subsidiary, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a
component of accumulated OCI and reclassified into net income at the time of the
sale of the foreign subsidiary.  For derivative instruments not
designated as hedging instruments but that are economic hedges, the gain or loss
is recognized in net income within realized gain (loss) during the period of
change.

We
purchase and issue financial instruments and products that contain embedded
derivative instruments.  When it is determined that the embedded
derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely
related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and a separate
instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the
embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement
purposes.  The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host
instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with
changes in fair value reported in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated
Statements of Income (Loss).  See Note 6 for additional discussion of
our derivative instruments.

We employ
several different methods for determining the fair value of our derivative
instruments.  The fair value of our derivative contracts are measured
based on current settlement values, which are based on quoted market prices,
industry standard models that are commercially available and broker
quotes.  These techniques project cash flows of the derivatives using
current and implied future market conditions.  We calculate the
present value of the cash flows to measure the current fair market value of the
derivative.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash and
invested cash is carried at cost and includes all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less.


DAC,
VOBA, DSI and DFEL

Commissions
and other costs of acquiring UL insurance, VUL insurance, traditional life
insurance, annuities and other investment contracts, which vary with and are
related primarily to the production of new business, have been deferred (i.e.,
DAC) to the extent recoverable.  VOBA is an intangible asset that
reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in a life insurance
company acquisition and represents the portion of the purchase price that is
allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the
business in force at the acquisition date.  Bonus credits and excess
interest for dollar cost averaging contracts are considered DSI, and the
unamortized balance is reported in other assets on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  Contract sales charges that are collected in the early years
of an insurance contract are deferred (referred to as “DFEL”), and the
unamortized balance is reported in other contract holder funds on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The
methodology for determining the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL varies
by product type.  For all insurance contracts, amortization is based
on assumptions consistent with those used in the development of the underlying
contract adjusted for emerging experience and expected trends.  Both
DAC and VOBA amortization is reported within underwriting, acquisition,
insurance and other expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss).  DSI is expensed in interest credited on our Consolidated
Statements of Income (Loss).  The amortization of DFEL is reported
within insurance fees on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss).

Acquisition
costs for UL and VUL insurance and investment-type products, which include fixed
and variable deferred annuities, are generally amortized over the lives of the
policies in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) from
surrender charges, investment, mortality net of reinsurance ceded and expense
margins and actual realized gain (loss) on investments.  Contract
lives for UL and VUL policies are estimated to be 30 years, based on the
expected lives of the contracts.  Contract lives for fixed and
variable deferred annuities are 14 to 20 years for the traditional, long
surrender charge period products and 8 to 10 years for the more recent
short-term or no surrender charge variable products.  The front-end
load annuity product has an assumed life of 25 years.  Longer lives
are assigned to those blocks that have demonstrated favorable lapse
experience.

All
traditional contracts, including traditional life insurance, which include
individual whole life, group business and term life insurance contracts, are
amortized over periods of 10 to 30 years on either a straight-line basis or as a
level percent of premium of the related policies depending on the block of
business.  There is currently no DAC, VOBA, DSI or DFEL balance or
related amortization for fixed and variable payout annuities.

The
carrying amounts of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL are adjusted for the effects of
realized and unrealized gains and losses on debt securities classified as AFS
and certain derivatives and embedded derivatives.  Amortization
expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL reflects an assumption for an expected level
of credit-related investment losses.  When actual credit-related
investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and
DFEL amortization within realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss) reflecting the incremental impact of actual versus expected
credit-related investment losses.  These actual to expected
amortization adjustments can create volatility from period to period in realized
gain (loss).

On a
quarterly basis, we may record an adjustment to the amounts included within our
Consolidated Balance Sheets for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL with an offsetting
benefit or charge to revenue or expense for the impact of the difference between
future EGPs used in the prior quarter and the emergence of actual and updated
future EGPs in the current quarter (“retrospective unlocking”).  In
addition, in the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive
review of the assumptions and the projection models used for our estimates of
future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and
the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity and life
insurance products with living benefit and death benefit
guarantees.  These assumptions include investment margins, mortality,
retention, rider utilization and maintenance expenses (costs associated with
maintaining records relating to insurance and individual and group annuity
contracts and with the processing of premium collections, deposits, withdrawals
and commissions).  Based on our review, the cumulative balances of
DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are
adjusted with an offsetting benefit or charge to revenue or amortization expense
to reflect such change (“prospective unlocking – assumption
changes”).  We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling
refinements (“prospective unlocking – model refinements”) that result in
increases or decreases to the carrying values of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded
derivatives and reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living
benefit and death benefit guarantees.  The primary distinction between
retrospective and prospective unlocking is that retrospective unlocking is
driven by the difference between actual gross profits compared to EGPs each
period, while prospective unlocking is driven by changes in assumptions or
projection models related to our projections of future EGPs.

DAC,
VOBA, DSI and DFEL are reviewed periodically to ensure that the unamortized
portion does not exceed the expected recoverable amounts.


Reinsurance

Our

insurance companies
enter into reinsurance agreements with other companies in the normal course of
business.  Assets and liabilities and premiums and benefits from
certain reinsurance contracts that grant statutory surplus relief to other
insurance companies are netted on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), respectively, because there is a right
of offset.  All other reinsurance agreements are reported on a gross
basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as an asset for amounts recoverable
from reinsurers or as a component of other liabilities for amounts, such as
premiums, owed to the reinsurers, with the exception of Modco agreements for
which the right of offset also exists.  Premiums, benefits and DAC are
reported net of insurance ceded.

Goodwill

We
recognize the excess of the purchase price, plus the fair value of any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of identifiable net
assets acquired as goodwill.  Goodwill is not amortized, but is
reviewed at least annually for indications of value impairment, with
consideration given to financial performance and other relevant
factors.  In addition, certain events, including a significant adverse
change in legal factors or the business climate, an adverse action or assessment
by a regulator or unanticipated competition, would cause us to review the
carrying amounts of goodwill for impairment.  We are required to
perform a two-step test in our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill for
impairment.  In Step 1 of the evaluation, the fair value of each
reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting
unit.  If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the
carrying value is deemed to be sufficient and Step 2 is not
required.  If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value,
it is an indicator that impairment may exist and Step 2 is required to be
performed.  In Step 2, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
goodwill is determined by assigning the reporting unit’s fair value as
determined in Step 1 to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as
if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of
the impairment test.  If the implied fair value of the reporting
unit’s goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and
written down to its fair value, and a charge is reported in impairment of
intangibles on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Specifically
Identifiable Intangible Assets

Specifically
identifiable intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, are reported in
other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The carrying values
of specifically identifiable intangible assets are reviewed periodically for
indicators of impairment in value that are other-than-temporary, including
unexpected or adverse changes in the following:  the economic or
competitive environments in which the company operates; profitability analyses;
cash flow analyses; and the fair value of the relevant business
operation.  If there was an indication of impairment, then the cash
flow method would be used to measure the impairment, and the carrying value
would be adjusted as necessary and reported in impairment of intangibles on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Sales
force intangibles are attributable to the value of the distribution system
acquired in the Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment.  These
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life of 25
years.

Specifically
identifiable intangible assets also include Federal Communications Commission
(“FCC”) licenses and other agreements reported within Other
Operations.  The FCC licenses are not amortized.

Other
Long-Lived Assets

Property
and equipment owned for company use is included in other assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets and is carried at cost less allowances for
depreciation.  Provisions for depreciation of investment real estate
and property and equipment owned for company use are computed principally on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
include buildings, computer hardware and software and other property and
equipment.

We
periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including
property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully
recoverable.  For long-lived assets to be held and used, impairments
are recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable
and exceeds its fair value.  The carrying amount of a long-lived asset
is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected
to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  An
impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a
long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

Long-lived
assets to be disposed of by abandonment or in an exchange for a similar
productive long-lived asset are classified as held-for-use until they are
disposed.


Long-lived
assets to be sold are classified as held-for-sale and are no longer
depreciated.  Certain criteria have to be met in order for the
long-lived asset to be classified as held-for-sale, including that a sale is
probable and expected to occur within one year.  Long-lived assets
classified as held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount
or fair value less cost to sell.

Separate
Account Assets and Liabilities

We
maintain separate account assets, which are reported at fair
value.  The related liabilities are reported at an amount equivalent
to the separate account assets.  Investment risks associated with
market value changes are borne by the contract holders, except to the extent of
minimum guarantees made by the Company with respect to certain
accounts.  See Note 11 for additional information regarding
arrangements with contractual guarantees.

We issue
variable annuity contracts through our separate accounts for which investment
income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk
is borne by, the contract holder (traditional variable annuities).  We
also issue variable annuity and life contracts through separate accounts that
include various types of guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”), guaranteed withdrawal
benefit (“GWB”) and guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) features.  The
GDB features include those where we contractually guarantee to the contract
holder either:  return of no less than total deposits made to the
contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net deposits”); total deposits
made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return
(“minimum return”); or the highest contract value on any contract anniversary
date through age 80 minus any payments or withdrawals following the contract
anniversary (“anniversary contract value”).

As
discussed in Note 6, certain features of these guarantees are accounted for as
embedded derivative reserves, whereas other guarantees are accounted for as
benefit reserves.  Other guarantees contain characteristics of both
and are accounted for under an approach that calculates the value of the
embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific
characteristics of each guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) feature.  We
use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings
volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for living benefits in
certain of our variable annuity products.  The change in fair value of
these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in the
value of the associated reserves.  The net impact of these changes is
reported as a component of realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss) in a category referred to as GLBs.

The
“market consistent scenarios” used in the determination of the fair value
of the GWB liability are similar to those used by an investment bank
to value derivatives for which the pricing is not transparent and the
aftermarket is nonexistent or illiquid.  In our calculation, risk-neutral
Monte-Carlo simulations resulting in over 10 million scenarios are utilized to
value the entire block of guarantees.  The market consistent scenario
assumptions, as of each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for
a hypothetical market participant. The market consistent inputs include
assumptions for the capital markets (e.g., implied volatilities, correlation
among indices, risk-free swap curve, etc.), policyholder behavior (e.g., policy
lapse, benefit utilization, mortality, etc.), risk margins, administrative
expenses and a margin for profit. We believe these assumptions are
consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as
the related markets develop we will continue to reassess our
assumptions.  It is possible that different valuation techniques and
assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair
value.

Future
Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Funds

The
liabilities for future contract benefits and claim reserves for UL and VUL
insurance policies consist of contract account balances that accrue to the
benefit of the contract holders, excluding surrender charges.  The
liabilities for future insurance contract benefits and claim reserves for
traditional life policies are computed using assumptions for investment yields,
mortality and withdrawals based principally on generally accepted actuarial
methods and assumptions at the time of contract issue.  Investment
yield assumptions for traditional direct individual life reserves for all
contracts range from 2.25% to 7.75% depending on the time of contract
issue.  The investment yield assumptions for immediate and deferred
paid-up annuities range from 1.00% to 13.50%.  These investment yield
assumptions are intended to represent an estimation of the interest rate
experience for the period that these contract benefits are payable.

The
liabilities for future claim reserves for variable annuity products containing
GDB features are calculated by estimating the present value of total expected
benefit payments over the life of the contract divided by the present value of
total expected assessments over the life of the contract (“benefit ratio”)
multiplied by the cumulative assessments recorded from the contract inception
through the balance sheet date less the cumulative GDB payments plus
interest.  The change in the reserve for a period is the benefit ratio
multiplied by the assessments recorded for the period less GDB claims paid in
the period plus interest.  If experience or assumption changes result
in a new benefit ratio, the reserves are adjusted to reflect the changes in a
manner similar to the unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and DSI.


With
respect to our future contract benefits and other contract holder funds, we
continually review:  overall reserve position, reserving techniques
and reinsurance arrangements.  As experience develops and new
information becomes known, liabilities are adjusted as deemed
necessary.  The effects of changes in estimates are included in the
operating results for the period in which such changes occur.

The
business written or assumed by us includes participating life insurance
contracts, under which the contract holder is entitled to share in the earnings
of such contracts via receipt of dividends.  The dividend scale for
participating policies is reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect
recent experience and future expectations.

UL and
VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 40% of
permanent life insurance in force as of December 31, 2009, and approximately 64%
of sales for these products in 2009.  Liabilities for the secondary
guarantees on UL-type products are calculated by multiplying the benefit ratio
by the cumulative assessments recorded from contract inception through the
balance sheet date less the cumulative secondary guarantee benefit payments plus
interest.  If experience or assumption changes result in a new benefit
ratio, the reserves are adjusted to reflect the changes in a manner similar to
the unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and DSI.  The accounting for
secondary guarantee benefits impacts, and is impacted by, EGPs used to calculate
amortization of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and DSI.

Future
contract benefits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include GLB features and
remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts that are carried at fair
value, which represents approximate surrender value including an estimate for
our nonperformance risk.  Our

Lincoln SmartSecurit

y®
Advantage GWB feature, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both insurance
benefits and embedded derivatives.  We weight these features and their
associated reserves accordingly based on their hybrid nature.  We
classify these items in Level 3 within the hierarchy levels described above in
“Fair Value Hierarchy.”

The fair
value of our indexed annuity contexts is based on their approximate surrender
values.

Borrowed
Funds

LNC’s
short-term borrowings are defined as borrowings with contractual or expected
maturities of one year or less.  Long-term borrowings have contractual
or expected maturities greater than one year.

Deferred
Gain on Business Sold Through Reinsurance

Our
reinsurance operations were acquired by Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc.
(“Swiss Re”) in December 2001 through a series of indemnity reinsurance
transactions.  We are recognizing the gain related to these
transactions at the rate that earnings on the reinsured business are expected to
emerge, over a period of 15 years.

Commitments
and Contingencies

Contingencies
arising from environmental remediation costs, regulatory judgments, claims,
assessments, guarantees, litigation, recourse reserves, fines, penalties and
other sources are recorded when deemed probable and reasonably
estimable.

Insurance
Fees

Insurance
fees for investment and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts consist of
asset-based fees, cost of insurance charges, percent of premium charges,
contract administration charges and surrender charges that are assessed against
contract holder account balances.  Investment products consist
primarily of individual and group variable and fixed deferred
annuities.  Interest-sensitive life insurance products include UL
insurance, VUL insurance and other interest-sensitive life insurance
policies.  These products include life insurance sold to individuals,
corporate-owned life insurance and bank-owned life insurance.

In
bifurcating the embedded derivative of our GLB features on our variable annuity
products, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees
collected from the contract holder that relate to the GLB riders (the
“attributed fees”), which are not reported within insurance fees on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).  These attributed fees
represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at
the inception of the contract plus a margin that a theoretical market
participant would include for risk/profit and are reported within realized gain
(loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).


The
timing of revenue recognition as it relates to fees assessed on investment
contracts is determined based on the nature of such fees.  Asset-based
fees, cost of insurance and contract administration charges are assessed on a
daily or monthly basis and recognized as revenue when assessed and
earned.  Percent of premium charges are assessed at the time of
premium payment and recognized as revenue when assessed and
earned.  Certain amounts assessed that represent compensation for
services to be provided in future periods are reported as unearned revenue and
recognized in income over the periods benefited.  Surrender charges
are recognized upon surrender of a contract by the contract holder in accordance
with contractual terms.

For
investment and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts, the amounts
collected from contract holders are considered deposits and are not included in
revenue.

Insurance
Premiums

Our
insurance premiums for traditional life insurance and group insurance products
are recognized as revenue when due from the contract holder.  Our
traditional life insurance products include those products with fixed and
guaranteed premiums and benefits and consist primarily of whole life insurance,
limited-payment life insurance, term life insurance and certain annuities with
life contingencies.  Our group non-medical insurance products consist
primarily of term life, disability and dental.

Net
Investment Income

Dividends
and interest income, recorded in net investment income, are recognized when
earned.  Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on
investments in debt securities are reflected in net investment income over the
contractual terms of the investments in a manner that produces a constant
effective yield.

For ABS
and MBS, included in the trading and AFS fixed maturity securities portfolios,
we recognize income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated
prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities.  When
actual prepayments differ significantly from originally anticipated prepayments,
the effective yield is recalculated prospectively to reflect actual payments to
date plus anticipated future payments.  Any adjustments resulting from
changes in effective yield are reflected in net investment income on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Realized
Gain (Loss)

Realized
gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) includes realized
gains and losses from the sale of investments, write-downs for
other-than-temporary impairments of investments, derivative and embedded
derivative gains and losses, gains and losses on the sale of subsidiaries and
businesses and net gains and losses on reinsurance embedded derivative and
trading securities.  Realized gains and losses on the sale of
investments are determined using the specific identification
method.  Realized gain (loss) is recognized in net income, net of
associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.  Realized gain
(loss) is also net of allocations of investment gains and losses to certain
contract holders and certain funds withheld on reinsurance arrangements for
which we have a contractual obligation.

Other
Revenues and Fees

Other
revenues and fees consists primarily of fees attributable to broker-dealer
services recorded as earned at the time of sale, changes in the market value of
our seed capital investments and communications sales recognized as earned, net
of agency and representative commissions.

Interest
Credited

Interest
credited includes interest credited to contract holder account
balances.  Interest crediting rates associated with funds invested in
the general account of LNC’s insurance subsidiaries during 2007 through 2009
ranged from 3.00% to 9.00%.

Benefits

Benefits
for UL and other interest-sensitive life insurance products include benefit
claims incurred during the period in excess of contract account
balances.  Benefits also include the change in reserves for life
insurance products with secondary guarantee benefits and annuity products with
guaranteed death benefits.  For traditional life, group health and
disability income products, benefits are recognized when incurred in a manner
consistent with the related premium recognition policies.


Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Pursuant
to the accounting rules for our obligations to employees under our various
pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we are required to make a number
of assumptions to estimate related liabilities and expenses.  We use
assumptions for the weighted-average discount rate and expected return on plan
assets to estimate pension expense.  The discount rate assumptions are
determined using an analysis of current market information and the projected
benefit flows associated with these plans.  The expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets is initially established at the beginning of the
plan year based on historical and projected future rates of return and is the
average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested in the
plan.  The calculation of our accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation also uses an assumption of weighted-average annual rate of increase
in the per capita cost of covered benefits, which reflects a health care cost
trend rate.  See Note 18 for additional information.

Stock-Based
Compensation

In
general, we expense the fair value of stock awards included in our incentive
compensation plans.  As of the date our stock awards are approved, the
fair value of stock options is determined using a Black-Scholes options
valuation methodology, and the fair value of other stock awards is based upon
the market value of the stock.  The fair value of the awards is
expensed over the service period, which generally corresponds to the vesting
period, and is recognized as an increase to common stock in stockholders’
equity.  We classify certain stock awards as
liabilities.  For these awards, the settlement value is classified as
a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and the liability is
marked-to-market through net income at the end of each reporting
period.  Stock-based compensation expense is reflected in
underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses on our Consolidated
Statements of Income (Loss).  See Note 20 for additional
information.

Interest
and Debt Expenses

Interest
expense on our short-term and long-term debt is recognized as due and any
associated premiums, discounts, costs or hedges are amortized (accreted) over
the term of the related borrowing utilizing the effective interest
method.

Income
Taxes

We file a
U.S. consolidated income tax return that includes all of our eligible
subsidiaries.  Ineligible subsidiaries file separate individual
corporate tax returns.  Subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are
taxed, and income tax expense is recorded based on applicable foreign
statutes.  Deferred income taxes are recognized, based on enacted
rates, when assets and liabilities have different values for financial statement
and tax reporting purposes.  A valuation allowance is recorded to the
extent required to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that we expect,
more likely than not, will be realized.  See Note 7 for additional
information.

Discontinued
Operations

The
results of operations of a component of the Company that either has been
disposed of or is classified as held-for-sale are reported in income (loss) from
discontinued operations for all periods presented if the operations and cash
flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing
operations as a result of the disposal transaction and we will not have any
significant continuing involvement in the operations.

Foreign
Currency Translation

Our
foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts and income statement items reported
in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the
current and average exchange rates for the year,
respectively.  Resulting translation adjustments and other translation
adjustments for foreign currency transactions that affect cash flows are
reported in accumulated OCI, a component of stockholders’ equity.

Earnings
Per Share

Basic
earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing earnings available to common
shareholders by the average common shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS is
computed assuming the conversion or exercise of dilutive convertible preferred
securities, nonvested stock, stock options, performance share units and deferred
compensation shares outstanding during the year.  For any period where
a net loss is experienced, shares used in the diluted EPS calculation represent
basic shares because using diluted shares would be anti-dilutive to the
calculation.


2.   New
Accounting Standards

Adoption
of New Accounting Standards

In June
2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended the current
hierarchy of GAAP, and identified the FASB

Accounting Standards
Codification

TM

(“ASC”) as the single source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the
FASB.  Although the FASB ASC did not change current GAAP, it
superseded all existing non-Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) accounting and reporting standards as of the effective
date.  The accounting guidance in the FASB ASC is organized by topical
reference, with all the contents having the same level of
authority.  We adopted the FASB ASC as of September 30, 2009, and have
revised all of the referencing of GAAP accounting standards in this filing to
reflect the appropriate references in the new FASB ASC.

Business
Combinations Topic

In
December 2007, the FASB revised the accounting guidance related to the Business
Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC.  This revised accounting guidance
retained the fundamental requirements for recognizing a business combination,
but established revised principles and requirements for the acquirer in a
business combination to measure and recognize the acquisition-date fair values
of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interests in the acquiree.  In addition, goodwill is measured as the
excess of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, in excess of the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired.  Any contingent consideration is
recognized at the acquisition-date fair value, acquisition costs must be
expensed in the period the costs are incurred and financial statement
disclosures were enhanced to provide users with information to evaluate the
nature and financial effects of the business combination.  We adopted
these revisions for acquisitions occurring after January 1, 2009.  The
adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition
or results of operations.

In April
2009, the FASB further amended the guidance in the Business Combinations Topic
related to the recognition and measurement of contingencies acquired in a
business combination.  Contingent assets acquired and liabilities
assumed (jointly referred to as “pre-acquisition contingencies”) in a business
combination are measured as of the acquisition-date fair value only if fair
value can be determined during the measurement period.  If the fair
value cannot be determined during the measurement period, but information is
available as of the end of the measurement period indicating the pre-acquisition
contingency is both probable and can be reasonably estimated, then the
pre-acquisition contingency is recognized as of the acquisition date based on
the estimated amount.  Subsequent to the acquisition date, the
measurement of pre-acquisition contingencies is dependent on the nature of the
contingency.  We adopted these amendments for acquisitions occurring
after January 1, 2009.  The adoption did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Compensation
– Retirement Benefits Topic

In
March 2007, the FASB amended the Compensation – Retirement Benefits Topic
of the FASB ASC requiring an employer to recognize a postretirement benefit
liability related to a collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance
arrangement, if the employer has agreed to maintain a life insurance policy
during the employee’s retirement.  In addition, based on the
split-dollar arrangement, an asset is recognized by the employer for the
estimated future cash flows to which the employer is
entitled.  Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted this new
accounting guidance by recording a $4 million cumulative effect adjustment
to the opening balance of retained earnings, offset by an increase to our
liability for postretirement benefits.  We also recorded notes
receivable for the amounts due to us from participants under the split-dollar
arrangements.  The recording of the notes receivable did not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

In
December 2008, the FASB amended the disclosure requirements for the Compensation
– Retirement Benefits Topic of the FASB ASC, which requires enhanced disclosures
regarding the plan assets of an employer’s defined benefit pension or other
postretirement benefit plans.  The new disclosures include information
regarding the investment allocation decisions made for plan assets, the fair
value of each major category of plan assets disclosed separately for pension
plans and other postretirement benefit plans and the inputs and valuation
techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, including the level
within the fair value hierarchy as defined by the Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC.  In addition, enhanced disclosures
are required for fair value measurements of plan assets using Level 3
inputs.  We adopted these amendments effective December 31, 2009, and
have prospectively included the enhanced disclosures related to the applicable
employee benefit plans in Note 18.


Consolidations
Topic

In
December 2007, the FASB amended the Consolidations Topic of the FASB ASC to
establish accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests, which
represents the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or
indirectly, to the parent.  Noncontrolling interests must be
identified, labeled and presented clearly on the face of the applicable
consolidated financial statements, with amounts attributable to the parent and
to the noncontrolling interest clearly identified.  Changes in a
parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial
interest must be consistently accounted for as an equity
transaction.  When a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained
noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be initially
measured at fair value.  The gain or loss on the deconsolidation of
the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling equity
investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained
investment.  In addition, financial statement disclosures must clearly
distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the
noncontrolling owners.  We adopted these amendments effective January
1, 2009.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Derivatives
and Hedging Topic

In March
2008, the FASB amended the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC to
expand the qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements for derivative
instruments and hedging activities to include how and why an entity uses
derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC guidance; and how derivative
instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
financial performance and cash flows. Quantitative disclosure requirements
include a tabular format by primary underlying risk and accounting designation
for the fair value amount, cross-referencing the location of derivative
instruments in the financial statements, the amount and location of gains and
losses in the financial statements for derivative instruments and related hedged
items and disclosures regarding credit-risk-related contingent features in
derivative instruments.  These expanded disclosure requirements apply
to all derivative instruments within the scope of the Derivatives and Hedging
Topic of the FASB ASC, nonderivative hedging instruments and all hedged items
designated and qualifying as hedges.  We adopted these amendments
effective January 1, 2009, and have prospectively included the enhanced
disclosures related to our derivative instruments and hedging activities in Note
6.

In
addition, in June 2008, the FASB amended the Derivatives and Hedging Topic
regarding the evaluation of an instrument (or embedded feature) indexed to an
entity’s own stock.  The amendments to the accounting guidance require
a two-step process to determine whether an equity-linked instrument (or embedded
feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock first by evaluating the
instrument’s contingent exercise provisions, if any, and second, by evaluating
the instrument’s settlement provisions.  We adopted this amendment to
the FASB ASC effective January 1, 2009, for all outstanding instruments as
of that date.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic

In
September 2006, the FASB updated the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure
Topic of the FASB ASC in order to establish a framework for measuring fair value
under current accounting guidance that requires or permits fair value
measurement, as well as to enhance disclosures about fair value measurements
used by an entity.  In the updated accounting guidance, the FASB
retained the notion of an exchange price, but clarified that exchange price is
the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the
asset or transfer the liability (exit price) in the principal market, or the
most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that asset or
liability, rather than the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or
receive a liability (entry price).  Fair value measurement is based on
assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability, which
may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset or
non-performance risk, which would include the reporting entity’s own credit
risk.  Inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value
were prioritized through a three-level fair value hierarchy defined as
follows:

·

Level
      1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in
      active markets for identical investments as of the reporting
      date.  “Blockage discounts” for large holdings of unrestricted
      financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly
      available for an identical asset or liability in an active market are
      prohibited;

·

Level
      2 – inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in
      active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of
      the reporting date, and fair value can be determined through the use of
      models or other valuation methodologies;
and

·

Level
      3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs in
      situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or
      liability, we make estimates and assumptions related to the pricing of the
      asset or liability, including assumptions regarding
  risk.


In
certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different
levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, an investment’s
level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that
is significant to the fair value measurement.  Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the
investment.

We have
certain guaranteed benefit features within our annuity products that, prior to
January 1, 2008, were recorded using fair value pricing, and we continue to
measure these benefits using fair value pricing after the adoption of these
updates to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic, utilizing Level 3
inputs and some Level 2 inputs, which are reflective of the hypothetical market
participant perspective for fair value measurement, including liquidity
assumptions and assumptions regarding the Company’s own credit or
non-performance risk. In addition, disclosure requirements for annual and
interim reporting were enhanced to focus on the inputs used to measure fair
value, including those measurements using significant unobservable inputs and
the effects of the measurements on earnings.  See Notes 1 and 22 for
additional information about our fair value disclosures for financial
instruments.

We
adopted the updates to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the
FASB ASC effective January 1, 2008, by recording increases
(decreases) to the following categories (in millions) on our consolidated
financial statements:

The
impact for the first quarter 2008 adoption to basic and diluted per share
amounts was a decrease of $0.06 per share.  In accordance with the
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Topic of the FASB ASC, we began applying
fair value measurement to nonfinancial assets and liabilities beginning January
1, 2009.  The application did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

See Note
1 for discussion of the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the fair
value of our financial instruments carried at fair value.

In
February 2007, the FASB amended the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
Topic of the FASB ASC to allow an entity to make an irrevocable election, on
specific election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value.  If
an entity elected the fair value option, unrealized gains and losses are
recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date, and any upfront costs
and fees related to the item are recognized in earnings as
incurred.  Effective January 1, 2008, we elected not to adopt the
fair value option for any financial assets or liabilities that existed as of
that date.

In April 2009, the FASB amended the Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic to provide additional guidance and key
considerations for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity
for an asset or liability has significantly decreased in relation to normal
market activity, as well as additional guidance on circumstances that may
indicate a transaction is not orderly.  A change in a valuation
technique resulting from the adoption of this amended guidance is accounted for
as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the FASB
ASC.  As permitted under the transition guidance, we elected to early
adopt these amendments to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic
effective January 1, 2009.  The adoption did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.


In August
2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updated (“ASU”) No. 2009-05,
“Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value” (“ASU 2009-05”) to provide further
guidance on the application of fair value measurement to
liabilities.  These amendments provide valuation techniques to be used
when measuring the fair value of a liability when a quoted price in an active
market is not available.  In addition, these amendments indicate that
an entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other
inputs related to a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability and
clarify when a quoted price for a liability would be considered a Level 1
input.  We adopted the accounting guidance in ASU 2009-05 for the
reporting period ending December 31, 2009.  The adoption did not have
a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of
operations.

In
September 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-12, “Investments in Certain
Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)” (“ASU
2009-12”), to permit the use of net asset value per share, without further
adjustment, to estimate the fair value of investments in investment companies
that do not have readily determinable fair values.  The net asset
value per share must be calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement
principles of the Financial Services – Investment Companies Topic of the FASB
ASC and can be used by investors in investments such as hedge funds, private
equity funds, venture capital funds and real estate funds.  If it is
probable the investment will be sold for an amount other than net asset value,
the investor is required to estimate the fair value of the
investment.  In addition, enhanced disclosures are required for all
investments within the scope of this accounting update.  We adopted
the guidance in ASU 2009-12 as of and for the year ended December 31,
2009.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations

Financial
Services – Insurance Industry Topic

In
September 2005, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued accounting guidance which amended the Financial Services – Insurance
Industry Topic of the FASB ASC related to the accounting by insurance
enterprises for DAC in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance
contracts.  Contract modifications that result in a substantially
unchanged contract are accounted for as a continuation of the replaced
contract.  Contract modifications that result in a substantially
changed contract are accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced
contract.  We adopted these amendments to the Financial Services –
Insurance Industry Topic effective January 1, 2007, by recording decreases
to total assets of $69 million, total liabilities of $28 million and
retained earnings of $41 million on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  In addition, this adoption also resulted in an approximately
$17 million increase to underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other
expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
December 31, 2007, which was attributable to changes in DAC and VOBA
deferrals and amortization.

In May
2008, the FASB updated the Financial Services – Insurance Industry Topic of the
FASB ASC with accounting guidance applicable to financial guarantee insurance
and reinsurance contracts not accounted for as derivative
instruments.  This accounting guidance changed current accounting
practice related to the recognition and measurement of premium revenue and claim
liabilities such that premium revenue recognition is linked to the amount of
insurance protection and the period in which it is provided, and a claim
liability is recognized when it is expected that a claim loss will exceed the
unearned premium revenue.  We do not hold any significant financial
guarantee insurance and reinsurance contracts, and as such, the adoption of this
amended accounting guidance on January 1, 2009, did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Income
Taxes Topic

In
June 2006, the FASB amended the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC in order
to provide a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure,
present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken
or expected to be taken on a tax return.  Companies are required to
determine whether it is “more likely than not” that an individual tax position
will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority prior to
any part of the benefit being recognized in the financial
statements.  We adopted the amendments to the Income Taxes Topic
effective January 1, 2007, by recording an increase in the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits of $15 million on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets, offset by a reduction to the beginning balance of retained
earnings.

Intangibles
– Goodwill and Other Topic

In April
2008, the FASB amended the Intangibles – Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASB
ASC related to the determination of the useful life of intangible
assets.  When developing renewal or extension assumptions in
determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets, an entity must
consider its own historical experience in renewing or extending similar
arrangements.  Absent the historical experience, an entity should use
market participant assumptions consistent with the highest and best use of the
asset.  The amendments also require enhance financial statement
disclosure regarding the extent to which expected future cash flows associated
with the asset are affected by an entity’s intent and/or ability to renew or
extend an arrangement.  We adopted these amendments effective January
1, 2009, and applied the guidance prospectively to recognized intangible assets
acquired after the effective date and applied the disclosure requirements to all
intangible assets recognized as of, and subsequent to, the effective
date.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial condition and results of operations.


Investments
– Debt and Equity Securities Topic

In April
2009, the FASB replaced the guidance in the Investments – Debt and Equity
Securities Topic of the FASB ASC related to OTTI.  Under this new
accounting guidance, management’s assertion that it has the intent and ability
to hold an impaired debt security until recovery was replaced by the requirement
for management to assert if it either has the intent to sell the debt security
or if it is more likely than not the entity will be required to sell the debt
security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.  If management
intends to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not the entity will
be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost
basis, an OTTI shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference
between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value as of the
balance sheet date.  After the recognition of an OTTI, the debt
security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of
the OTTI, with an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost
basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings.

If
management does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely
than not the entity will be required to sell the debt security before recovery
of its amortized cost basis, but the present value of the cash flows expected to
be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the debt security
(referred to as the credit loss), an OTTI is considered to have
occurred.  In this instance, the total OTTI must be bifurcated into
the amount related to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, with the
remaining amount of the total OTTI attributed to other factors (referred to as
the noncredit portion) recognized as a separate component in
OCI.  After the recognition of an OTTI, the debt security is accounted
for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the OTTI, with an
amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI
recognized in earnings.  In addition, the amendments to this topic
expand and increase the frequency of existing disclosures about OTTI for debt
and equity securities regarding expected cash flows, credit losses and the aging
of securities with unrealized losses.

As
permitted by the transition guidance, we early adopted these amendments to the
Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic effective January 1, 2009,
by recording an increase of $102 million to the opening balance of retained
earnings with a corresponding decrease to accumulated OCI on our Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders’ Equity to reclassify the noncredit portion of
previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities held as of January 1,
2009.  The following summarizes the components (in millions) for this
cumulative effect adjustment:

The
cumulative effect adjustment was calculated for all debt securities held as of
January 1, 2009, for which an OTTI was previously recognized, and for which we
did not intend to sell the security and it was not more likely than not that we
would be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, by
comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be received as of January
1, 2009, to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities.  The
discount rate used to calculate the present value of the cash flows expected to
be collected was the rate for each respective debt security in effect before
recognizing any OTTI.  In addition, because the carrying amounts of
DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL are adjusted for the effects of realized and unrealized
gains and losses on fixed maturity AFS securities, we recognized a true-up to
our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL balances for this cumulative effect
adjustment.

The
following summarizes the increase to the amortized cost of our fixed maturity
AFS securities (in millions) as of January 1, 2009, resulting from the
recognition of the cumulative effect adjustment:

The
impact of this adoption to both basic and diluted per share amounts for the year
ended December 31, 2009, was an increase of $0.98 per share.


In
addition, we include on the face of our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss)
the total OTTI recognized in realized loss, with an offset for the amount of
noncredit impairments recognized in accumulated OCI.  We disclose the
amount of OTTI recognized in accumulated OCI in Note 15, and the enhanced
disclosures related to OTTI are included in Note 5.

Investments
– Equity Method and Joint Ventures Topic

In
November 2008, the FASB amended the Investments – Equity Method and Joint
Ventures Topic of the FASB ASC to address the impact to the accounting for
equity method investments resulting from recent amendments to the Business
Combinations and Consolidations Topics.  The amendments require the
subsequent issuances of shares by the equity–method investee, which may reduce
the investor’s ownership percentage, be accounted for as if the investor sold a
proportionate share of the investment, with gain or loss recognized through
earnings.  We adopted the amendments on January 1, 2009,
prospectively for all investments accounted for under the equity
method.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Investments
– Other Topic

In
January 2009, the FASB revised the Investments – Other Topic of the FASB
ASC in order to eliminate the requirement for holders of beneficial interests to
estimate cash flow using a market participant’s assumptions regarding current
information and events in determining the current fair value of the
security.  The revised accounting guidance requires the use of all
available information relevant to the security, including information about past
events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable
forecasts.  We adopted the revisions to the Investments – Other Topic
as of December 31, 2008.  The adoption did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Subsequent
Events Topic

In May
2009, the FASB updated the Subsequent Events Topic of the FASB ASC in order to
establish standards of accounting for the disclosure of events that take place
after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are
issued.  The effect of all subsequent events that existed as of the
balance sheet date must be recognized in the financial
statements.  For those events that did not exist as of the balance
sheet date, but arose after the balance sheet date and before the financial
statements are issued, recognition is not required, but depending on the nature
of the event, disclosure may be required in order to keep the financial
statements from being misleading.  We adopted these provisions,
prospectively, as of the interim reporting period ended June 30,
2009.  The adoption of these amendments to the Subsequent Event Topic
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or
results of operations.

Transfers
and Servicing Topic

In
February 2008, the FASB updated the Transfers and Servicing Topic of the FASB
ASC regarding transfers of financial assets and the guidance for when a
repurchase financing should be considered a linked transaction.  Under
a repurchase financing transaction, the transferor and the transferee are not
permitted to separately account for the transfer of a financial asset and a
related repurchase financing unless the two transactions have a valid and
distinct business or economic purpose for being entered into separately and the
repurchase financing does not result in the initial transferor regaining control
over the financial asset.  In addition, an initial transfer of a
financial asset and a repurchase financing entered into contemporaneously with,
or in contemplation of, one another, must meet specific criteria in order to
receive separate accounting treatment.  We adopted this update
effective January 1, 2009, and the adoption did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Future
Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Consolidations
Topic

In June
2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-17, “Improvements to Financial Reporting by
Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities” (“ASU 2009-17”), which
amends the consolidation guidance related to VIEs.  Primarily, the
current quantitative analysis used under the Consolidations Topic of the FASB
ASC will be eliminated and replaced with a qualitative approach that is focused
on identifying the variable interest that has the power to direct the activities
that most significantly impact the performance of the VIE and absorb losses or
receive returns that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  In
addition, this new accounting standard will require an ongoing reassessment of
the primary beneficiary of the VIE, rather than reassessing the primary
beneficiary only upon the occurrence of certain pre-defined
events.  ASU 2009-17 will be effective as of the beginning of the
annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, and requires the
reconsideration of all VIEs for consolidation in which an entity has a variable
interest upon the effective date of these amendments.


In
preparation for our adoption of ASU 2009-17 effective January 1, 2010,
we are continuing to evaluate our involvement with entities we
have determined are VIEs.  Based on this evaluation, we may be required to
consolidate the VIEs associated with our investment in CLNs.  Upon the
initial adoption of ASU 2009-17, if we consolidate the assets and
liabilities of these VIEs, we have estimated the impact to be approximately $200
million, after-tax, which will be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to
the beginning balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2010.  See Note
5 for more detail regarding our CLNs.

Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic

In
January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06, “Improving Disclosures about Fair
Value Measurements” (“ASU 2010-06”), which primarily requires new disclosures
related to the levels within the fair value hierarchy.  An entity will
be required to disclose significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 of
the fair value hierarchy, and separately present information related to
purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of fair value
measurements classified as Level 3.  In addition, ASU 2010-06 will
amend the fair value disclosure requirement for pension and postretirement
benefit plan assets to require this disclosure at the investment class
level.  ASU 2010-06 will be effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures related to
purchases, sales, issuances and settlements for Level 3 fair value measurements,
which are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2010.  We will include the disclosures as required by ASU 2010-06 in
the notes to our consolidated financial statements effective January 1, 2010,
except for the disclosures related to Level 3 fair value measurements, which we
will include in the notes to our consolidated financial statements effective
January 1, 2011

Transfers
and Servicing Topic

In June
2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-16, “Accounting for Transfers of Financial
Assets” (“ASU 2009-16”), which will eliminate the concept of a qualifying
special-purpose entity (“SPE”) and will remove the scope exception for a
qualifying SPE from the Consolidations Topic of the FASB ASC.  As a
result, previously unconsolidated qualifying SPEs must be re-evaluated for
consolidation by the sponsor or transferor.  In addition, this
accounting update amends the accounting guidance related to transfers of
financial assets in order to address practice issues that have been highlighted
by the events of the recent economic decline.  ASU 2009-16 is
effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after
November 15, 2009.  The recognition and measurement provisions will be
applied to transfers that occur on or after the effective date and all
qualifying SPEs that exist on and after the effective date must be evaluated for
consolidation.  We will adopt the provisions of ASU 2009-16 effective
January 1, 2010, and do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on
our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

3.  Acquisitions
and Dispositions

Acquisitions

Newton
County Loan & Savings, FSB (“NCLS”)

On
January 8, 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision approved our application to
become a savings and loan holding company and our acquisition of NCLS, a
federally regulated savings bank located in Indiana.  We contributed
$10 million to the capital of NCLS.  We closed on our purchase of NCLS
on January 15, 2009, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

Dispositions

Discontinued
Investment Management Operations

On
August 18, 2009, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with
Macquarie Bank Limited (“MBL”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell to MBL all
of the outstanding capital stock of Delaware Management Holdings, Inc.
(“Delaware”), our subsidiary, which provides investment products and services to
individuals and institutions.  This transaction closed on January 4,
2010.

In
addition, certain of our subsidiaries, including LNL, our primary insurance
subsidiary, entered into investment advisory agreements with Delaware, pursuant
to which Delaware will continue to manage the majority of the general account
insurance assets of the subsidiaries.  The investment advisory
agreements will have 10-year terms, and we may terminate them without
cause, subject to a purchase price adjustment of up to $84 million in the
event that all of the agreements with our subsidiaries are
terminated.  The amount of the potential adjustment will decline on a
pro rata basis over the 10-year term of the advisory
agreements.


Accordingly,
the assets and liabilities of this business have been reclassified as
held-for-sale for all periods presented and are reported within other assets and
other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The major
classes of assets and liabilities held-for-sale (in millions) were as
follows:

As
      of December 31,

We have
reclassified the results of operations of Delaware into income (loss) from
discontinued operations for all periods presented on our Consolidated Statements
of Income (Loss), and selected amounts (in millions) were as
follows:

There
could be post-closing adjustments, some of which are beyond our control, and no
assurance can be given as to the timing of its completion as an extension beyond
120 days is allowed in the share purchase agreement if there is disagreement
during this period.

The
transaction is expected to be neutral to earnings per share assuming
reinvestment of net proceeds back into core insurance businesses.  We
expect a modest gain on disposal, which will be recorded during the first
quarter of 2010; however, the actual gain (loss) may differ from our expected
result depending upon, among other things, the actual purchase price after
closing adjustments.

Certain
Delaware employees held equity awards that allowed for the acceleration of
vesting upon the sale of Delaware.  The acceleration of these awards
will result in stock compensation expense of approximately $17 million in the
first quarter of 2010, which will be reported in income (loss) from discontinued
operations.


Discontinued
U.K. Operations

On
June 15, 2009, we entered into a share purchase agreement with SLF of
Canada UK Limited (“SLF”) and Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, as the
guarantor, pursuant to which we agreed to sell to SLF all of the outstanding
capital stock of Lincoln National (UK) plc (“Lincoln UK”), our subsidiary, which
is focused primarily on providing life and retirement income products in the
United Kingdom.  This transaction closed on October 1, 2009, and we
retained Lincoln UK’s pension plan assets and liabilities.

Accordingly,
in the periods prior to the closing, the assets and liabilities of this business
have been reclassified as held-for-sale and were reported within other assets
and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The major
classes of assets and liabilities held-for-sale (in millions) as of December 31,
2008, were as follows:

We have
reclassified the results of operations of Lincoln UK into income (loss) from
discontinued operations for all periods presented on our Consolidated Statements
of Income (Loss), and selected amounts (in millions) were as
follows:


There
will be a post-closing adjustment of the purchase price based upon a final
actuarial appraisal of the value of the business as set forth in the share
purchase agreement.

Discontinued
Media Operations

During
the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our
television broadcasting, Charlotte radio and sports programming
businesses.  The sports programming sale closed on November 30, 2007,
the Charlotte radio broadcasting sale closed on January 31, 2008, and the
television broadcasting sale closed on March 31, 2008.

The
results of operations of these businesses were reclassified into income (loss)
from discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss),
and selected amounts (in millions) were as follows:

4.  Variable
Interest Entities

Our
involvement with VIEs is primarily to obtain financing and to invest in assets
that allow us to gain exposure to a broadly diversified portfolio of asset
classes.  We have carefully analyzed each VIE to determine whether we
are the primary beneficiary.  Based on our analysis of the expected
losses and residual returns of the VIEs in which we have a variable interest, we
have concluded that there are no VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary,
and, as such, we have not consolidated the VIEs in our consolidated financial
statements.  However, for those VIEs in which we are not the primary
beneficiary, but hold a variable interest, we recognize the fair value of our
variable interest on our consolidated financial statements.

Information
(in millions) included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for those VIEs where
we had significant variable interest and where we were a sponsor was as
follows:

Affiliated
Trust

We are
the sponsor of an affiliated trust, Lincoln National Capital Trust VI, which was
formed solely for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and lending
the proceeds to us.  We own the common securities of this trust,
approximately a 3% ownership, and the only assets of the trust are the junior
subordinated debentures issued by us. Our common stock investment in this
trust was financed by the trust and is reported in other investments on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Distributions are paid by the trust to
the preferred security holders on a quarterly basis and the principal
obligations of the trust are irrevocably guaranteed by us.  Upon
liquidation of the trust, the holders of the preferred securities are entitled
to a fixed amount per share plus accumulated and unpaid distributions. We
reserve the right to redeem the preferred securities at a fixed price plus
accumulated and unpaid distributions and defer the interest payments due on the
subordinated debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters, but not beyond the
maturity date of the subordinated debenture.


Our
common stock investment does not represent a significant variable interest in
the trust, as we do not receive any distributions or absorb any losses from the
trust.  In addition, our guarantee of the principal obligations of the
trust does not represent a variable interest, as we are guaranteeing our own
performance.  Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary and do not
consolidate the trust.  Since our investment in the common stock of
the trust was financed directly by the trust, we do not have any equity
investment at risk, and, therefore, do not have exposure to loss from the
trust.

Credit-Linked
Notes

We
invested in two CLNs where the note holders do not have voting rights or
decision-making capabilities.  The entities that issued the CLNs are
financed by the note holders, and, as such, the note holders participate in the
expected losses and residual returns of the entities.  Because the
note holders’ investment does not permit them to make decisions about the
entities’ activities that would have a significant effect on the success of the
entities, we have determined that these entities are VIEs.  As of
December 31, 2009, we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as the
multi-tiered class structure of the CLNs requires the subordinated classes of
the investment pool to absorb credit losses prior to our class of
notes.  As a result, we will not absorb the majority of the expected
losses and the coupon we receive on the CLNs limits our participation in the
residual returns.  For information regarding our exposure to loss in
our CLNs, see “Credit-Linked Notes” in Note 5.


5.  Investments

AFS
Securities

Pursuant
to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, we have
categorized AFS securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority
of the inputs to the respective valuation technique.  The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs (Level 3), as described in Note 1, which also includes
additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.

The
amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, losses and OTTI and fair value of AFS
securities (in millions) were as follows:

(1)

This
      amount is comprised of the gross unrealized OTTI cumulative effect
      adjustment as discussed in Note 2 and the amount reflected on our
      Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) during the year ended December
      31, 2009 adjusted for other changes, including but not limited to, sales
      of fixed maturity AFS
securities.

amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity AFS securities by contractual
maturities (in millions) were as follows:

The fair
value and gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in
OCI, of AFS securities (in millions), aggregated by investment category and
length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized
loss position, were as follows:


We
perform detailed analysis on the AFS securities backed by pools that are most at
risk of impairment based on factors discussed in Note 1.  Selected
information for these securities in a gross unrealized loss position (in
millions) was as follows:

For the
year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded OTTI for AFS securities backed by
pools of residential and commercial mortgages of $538 million, pre-tax, and
before associated amortization expense for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, of which
$234 million was recognized in OCI and $304 million was recognized in net income
(loss).


The fair
value, gross unrealized losses, the portion of OTTI recognized in OCI (in
millions) and number of AFS securities where the fair value had declined and
remained below amortized cost by greater than 20% were as follows:

(1)

We
      may reflect a security in more than one aging category based on various
      purchase dates.

We
regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI.  Based upon this
review, the cause of the $4.6 billion decrease in our gross AFS securities
unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2009, was attributable
primarily to increased liquidity in several market segments and improved credit
fundamentals (i.e., market improvement and narrowing credit spreads), partially
offset by the cumulative adjustment resulting from the adoption of new
accounting guidance related to the recognition of OTTI, which resulted in the
$165 million increase in amortized cost in AFS securities as discussed in Note
2.  As discussed further below, we believe the unrealized loss
position as of December 31, 2009, does not represent OTTI as we did not intend
to sell these fixed maturity AFS securities, it is not more likely than not that
we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of
their amortized cost basis, the estimated future cash flows were equal to or
greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, or we had the
ability and intent to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time
sufficient for recovery.

Based
upon this evaluation as of December 31, 2009, management believed we had the
ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our normal operations (e.g.,
insurance premiums and fees and investment income) to meet cash requirements
with a prudent margin of safety without requiring the sale of our
temporarily-impaired securities.

As of
December 31, 2009, the unrealized losses associated with our corporate bond
securities were attributable primarily to commercial mortgage backed securities
that were backed by commercial loans and individual issuer
companies.  For our corporate bond securities with commercial loans as
the underlying collateral, we evaluated the projected credit losses in the
security and concluded that we had sufficient subordination or other credit
enhancement when compared with our estimate of credit losses for the individual
security and we expected to recover the entire amortized cost for each
security.  For individual issuers, we performed detailed analysis of
the financial performance of the issuer and determined that we expected to
recover the entire amortized cost for each security.

As of
December 31, 2009, the unrealized losses associated with our MBS and ABS CDOs
were attributable primarily to collateral losses and credit
spreads.  We assessed for credit impairment using a cash flow model as
discussed above.  The key assumptions included default rates,
severities and prepayment rates.  We estimated losses for a security
by forecasting the underlying loans in each transaction.  The
forecasted loan performance was used to project cash flows to the various
tranches in the structure, as applicable.  Cash flow forecasts also
considered, as applicable, independent industry analyst reports and forecasts,
sector credit ratings and other independent market data.  Based upon
our assessment of the expected credit losses of the security given the
performance of the underlying collateral compared to our subordination or other
credit enhancement, we expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of
each security.


As of
December 31, 2009, the unrealized losses associated with our hybrid and
redeemable preferred securities were attributable primarily to wider credit
spreads caused by illiquidity in the market and subordination within the capital
structure as well as credit risk of specific issuers.  For our hybrid
and redeemable preferred securities, we evaluated the financial performance of
the issuer based upon credit performance and investment ratings and determined
we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each security.

Changes
in the amount of credit loss of OTTI recognized in net income (loss) where the
portion related to other factors was recognized in OCI (in millions) on fixed
maturity AFS securities were as follows:

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded credit losses on securities for
which an OTTI was not previously recognized as we determined the cash flows
expected to be collected would not be sufficient to recover the entire amortized
cost basis of the security.  The credit losses we recorded on
securities for which an OTTI was not previously recognized were attributable
primarily to one or a combination of the following reasons:

·

Failure
      of the issuer of the security to make scheduled
  payments;

·

Deterioration
      of creditworthiness of the issuer;

·

Deterioration
      of conditions specifically related to the
  security;

·

Deterioration
      of fundamentals of the industry in which the issuer
    operates;

·

Deterioration
      of fundamentals in the economy including, but not limited to, higher
      unemployment and lower housing prices;
and

·

Deterioration
      of the rating of the security by a rating
  agency.

We
recognize the OTTI attributed to the noncredit portion as a separate component
in OCI referred to as unrealized OTTI on AFS securities.

Details
of the amount of credit loss of OTTI recognized in net income (loss) where the
portion related to other factors was recognized in OCI (in millions) as of
December 31, 2009, were as follows:

Mortgage
Loans on Real Estate

Mortgage
loans on real estate principally involve commercial real estate.  The
commercial loans are geographically diversified throughout the U.S. with the
largest concentrations in California and Texas, which accounted for
approximately 29% and 30% of mortgage loans as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  The number of impaired mortgage loans and the carrying

underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) that was

above, and the portion of OTTI recognized in OCI (in millions) were as
follows:

Determination
of Credit Losses on Corporate Bonds and ABS CDOs

As of
December 31, 2009, we reviewed our corporate bond and ABS CDO portfolios for
potential shortfall in contractual principal and interest based on numerous
subjective and objective inputs.  The factors used to determine the
amount of credit loss for each individual security, include, but are not limited
to, near term risk, substantial discrepancy between book and market value,
sector or company-specific volatility, negative operating trends and trading
levels wider than peers.

Credit
ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a
security.  Securities rated investment grade, that is those rated BBB-
or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Baa3 or higher by Moody’s
Investors Service, are generally considered by the rating agencies and market
participants to be low credit risk.  As of December 31, 2009, 94% of
the fair value of our corporate bond portfolio was rated investment
grade.  As of December 31, 2009, our corporate bond portfolio rated
below investment grade had an amortized cost of $3.1 billion and a fair value of
$2.7 billion.  As of December 31, 2009, 89% of the fair value of our
ABS CDO portfolio was rated investment grade.  As of December 31,
2009, our ABS CDO portfolio rated below investment grade had an amortized cost
of $20 million and fair value $18 million.  Based upon the analysis
discussed above we believed as of December 31, 2009 we would recover the
amortized cost of each corporate bond and ABS CDO security.

For
securities where we recorded an OTTI recognized in net income (loss) for the
year ended December 31, 2009 the recovery as a percentage of amortized cost was
72% for corporate bonds and 33% for ABS CDOs.


Determination
of Credit Losses on MBS

As of
December 31, 2009, default rates were projected by considering underlying MBS
loan performance and collateral type.  Projected default rates on
existing delinquencies vary between 25% to 100% depending on loan type and
severity of delinquency status.  In addition, we estimate the potential
contributions of currently performing loans that may become delinquent in the
future based on the change in delinquencies and loan liquidations experienced in
the recent history.  Finally, we develop a default rate timing curve
by aggregating the defaults for all loans (delinquent loans, foreclosure and
real estate owned and new delinquencies from currently performing loans) in the
pool to project the future expected cash flows.

We use
certain available loan characteristics such as lien status, loan sizes and
occupancy to estimate the loss severity of loans.  Second lien loans
are assigned 100% severity, if defaulted.  For first lien loans, we
assume a minimum of 30% loan severity with higher severity assumed for investor
properties and further housing price depreciation.

Our
      pledged securities under securities lending agreements are included in
      fixed maturity AFS securities on our Consolidated Balance
      Sheets.  We generally obtain collateral in an amount equal to
      102% and 105% of the fair value of the domestic and foreign securities,
      respectively.  We value collateral daily and obtain additional
      collateral when deemed appropriate.  The cash received in our
      securities lending program is typically invested in cash and invested cash
      or fixed maturity AFS securities.

Our
      pledged securities under reverse repurchase agreements are included in
      fixed maturity AFS securities on our Consolidated Balance
      Sheets.  We obtain collateral in an amount equal to 95% of the
      fair value of the securities, and our agreements with third parities
      contain contractual provisions to allow for additional collateral to be
      obtained when necessary.  The cash received in our reverse

Our
      pledged securities for TALF are included in fixed maturity AFS securities
      on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We obtain collateral in an
      amount that has typically averaged 90% of the fair value of the TALF
      securities.  The cash received in these transactions is invested
      in fixed maturity AFS securities.

Investment
Commitments

As of
December 31, 2009, our investment commitments for fixed maturity AFS securities
(primarily private placements), limited partnerships, real estate and mortgage
loans on real estate were $786 million, which included $381 million of limited
partnerships, $220 million of standby commitments to purchase real estate upon
completion and leasing and $182 million of private placements.

Concentrations
of Financial Instruments

As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, our most significant investment in one issuer was
our investment securities issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
with a fair value of $4.8 billion and $3.5 billion, or 6% and 5% of our invested
assets portfolio totaling $75.9 billion and $66.5 billion, respectively. As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, our most significant investment in one industry was
our investment securities in the CMO industry with a fair value of $6.9 billion
and $6.8 billion, or 9% and 10% of the invested assets portfolio,
respectively.  We utilized the industry classifications to obtain the
concentration of financial instruments amount, as such, this amount will not
agree to the AFS securities table above.

Credit-Linked
Notes

As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, other contract holder funds on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets included $600 million outstanding in funding
agreements of LNL.  LNL invested the proceeds of $600 million received
for issuing two funding agreements in 2006 and 2007 into two separate CLNs
originated by a third party company.  The CLNs are included in fixed
maturity AFS securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

To date,
there has been one default in the underlying collateral pool of the $400 million
CLN and two defaults in the underlying collateral pool of the $200 million
CLN.  There has been no event of default on the CLNs
themselves.  Based upon our analysis, the remaining subordination as
represented by the attachment point should be sufficient to absorb future credit
losses, subject to changing market conditions.  Similar to other debt
market instruments, our maximum principal loss is limited to our original
investment of $600 million as of December 31, 2009.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, as in the general markets, spreads on these
transactions have tightened, reducing unrealized losses.  We had
unrealized losses of $278 million on the $600 million in CLNs and $550 million
on the $600 million in CLNs as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  As described more fully in the realized loss related to
investments section above, we regularly review our investment holdings for
OTTI.  Based upon this review, we believe that these securities were
not other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  The following summarizes the fair value to amortized
cost ratio of the CLNs:

6.  Derivative
Instruments

Types
of Derivative Instruments and Derivative Strategies

We
maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of
derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in
earnings that are caused by interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk,
basis risk, equity market risk and credit risk.  We assess these risks
by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposure,
foreign currency exposure, equity market exposure and credit exposure that may
adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging
opportunities. Derivative instruments that are used as part of our interest
rate risk management strategy include interest rate swap agreements, interest
rate futures, interest rate cap agreements, forward-starting interest rate swaps
and treasury locks. Derivative instruments that are used as part of our
foreign currency risk management strategy include foreign currency swaps,
currency futures and foreign currency forwards.  Call options based on
our stock, call options based on the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500
Index® (“S&P 500”), total return swaps, variance swaps, equity collars, put
options and equity futures are used as part of our equity market risk management
strategy.  We also use credit default swaps as part of our credit risk
management strategy.

We
evaluate and recognize our derivative instruments in accordance with the
Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC.  As of December 31,
2009, we had derivative instruments that were designated and qualifying as cash
flow hedges, fair value hedges and the hedge of a net investment in a foreign
subsidiary.  We also had embedded derivatives that did not qualify as
hedging instruments and derivative instruments that were economic hedges, but
were not designed to meet the requirements to be accounted for as a
hedge.  See Note 1 for a detailed discussion of the accounting
treatment for derivative instruments.

Our
derivative instruments are monitored by our Asset Liability Management Committee
and our Equity Risk Management Committee as part of those committees’ oversight
of our derivative activities.  Our committees are responsible for
implementing various hedging strategies that are developed through their
analysis of financial simulation models and other internal and industry
sources.  The resulting hedging strategies are incorporated into our
overall risk management strategies.

We use a
hedging strategy designed to mitigate the risk and income statement volatility
caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and volatility
associated with living benefit guarantees offered in our variable annuity
products, including the

Lincoln SmartSecurit

y®
Advantage GWB feature, the 4LATER® Advantage GIB feature and the

i4LIFE

® Advantage GIB
feature.  See “Guaranteed Living Benefit Embedded Derivative Reserves”
below for further details.

See Note
22 for disclosures required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic
of the FASB ASC.


We have
derivative instruments with off-balance-sheet risks whose notional or contract
amounts exceed the credit exposure.  Outstanding derivative
instruments with off-balance-sheet risks (in millions) were as
follows:


(1)

Reported
      in derivative investments on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

millions) was as follows:


The
change in our unrealized gain on derivative instruments in accumulated OCI (in
millions) was as follows:

      OCI offset is reported within net investment income on our Consolidated
      Statements of Income (Loss).

(2)

The
      OCI offset is reported within interest and debt expense on our
      Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss).


The
settlement payments and mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments (in
millions) recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) were as
follows:

(1)

Reported

      (Loss).

(2)

Reported
      in interest and debt expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income

Derivative
Instruments Designated and Qualifying as Cash Flow Hedges

Gains

As of
December 31, 2009, none of the deferred net gains on derivative instruments in
accumulated OCI is expected to be reclassified to earnings during
2010.  This reclassification would be due primarily to the receipt of
interest payments associated with variable rate securities and forecasted
purchases, payment of interest on our senior debt, the receipt of interest
payments associated with foreign currency securities, and the periodic vesting
of stock appreciation rights (“SARs”).

For the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were no material
reclassifications to earnings due to hedged firm commitments no longer deemed
probable or due to hedged forecasted transactions that had not occurred by the
end of the originally specified time period.

Interest
Rate Swap Agreements

We use a
portion of our interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk to
our exposure to floating rate bond coupon payments, replicating a fixed rate
bond.  An interest rate swap is a contractual agreement to exchange
payments at one or more times based on the actual or expected price level,
performance or value of one or more underlying interest rates.  We are
required to pay the counterparty the stream of variable interest payments based
on the coupon payments from the hedged bonds, and in turn, receive a fixed
payment from the counterparty at a predetermined interest rate.  The
net receipts or payments from these interest rate swaps are recorded on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as specified in the table
above.  The gains or losses on interest rate swaps hedging our
interest rate exposure on floating rate bond coupon payments are reclassified
from accumulated OCI to net income as the related bond interest is
accrued.

In
addition, we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to fixed
rate bond coupon payments and the change in underlying asset values as interest
rates fluctuate.  The net receipts or payments from these interest
rate swaps are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as
specified in the table above.

As of
December 31, 2009, the latest maturity date for which we were hedging our
exposure to the variability in future cash flows for these instruments was June
2037.

Foreign
Currency Swaps

We use
foreign currency swaps, which are traded over-the-counter, to hedge some of the
foreign exchange risk of investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in
foreign currencies.  A foreign currency swap is a contractual
agreement to exchange the currencies of two different countries at a specified
rate of exchange in the future.  The gains or losses on foreign
currency swaps hedging foreign exchange risk exposure on foreign currency bond
coupon payments are reclassified from accumulated OCI to net income as the
related bond interest is accrued.

As of
December 31, 2009, the latest maturity date for which we were hedging our
exposure to the variability in future cash flows for these instruments was July
2022.


Derivative
Instruments Designated and Qualifying as Fair Value Hedges

We
designate and account for interest rate swap agreements and equity collars as
fair value hedges, when they have met the requirements of the Derivatives and
Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC.  Information related to our fair value
hedges (in millions) was as follows:

Interest
Rate Swap Agreements

We use a
portion of our interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk of paying a
higher fixed rate of interest on junior subordinated debentures issued to
affiliated trusts and on senior debt than would be paid on long-term debt based
on current interest rates in the marketplace.  We are required to pay
the counterparty a stream of variable interest payments based on the referenced
index, and in turn, we receive a fixed payment from the counterparty at a
predetermined interest rate.  The net receipts/payments from these
interest rate swaps are recorded as an adjustment to the interest expense for
the debt being hedged.  The changes in fair value of the interest rate
swap are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as specified
in the table above in the period of change, along with the offsetting changes in
fair value of the debt being hedged.

Equity
Collars

We used
an equity collar on four million shares of our Bank of America (“BOA”) stock
holdings.  The equity collar is structured such that we purchased a
put option on the BOA stock and simultaneously sold a call option with the
identical maturity date as the put option.  This structure effectively
protects us from a price decline in the stock while allowing us to participate
in some of the upside if the BOA stock appreciates over the time of the
transaction.  With the equity collar in place, we are able to pledge
the BOA stock as collateral, which then allows us to advance a substantial
portion of the stock’s value, effectively monetizing the stock for liquidity
purposes. This variable forward contract is scheduled to settle in
September 2010, at which time we will be required to deliver shares or
cash.  If we choose to settle in shares, the number of shares to be
delivered will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price of BOA
common stock over a period of 10 trading days prior to
settlement.  The change in fair value of the equity collar is recorded
on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as specified in the table above
in the period of change, along with the offsetting changes (when applicable) in
fair value of the stock being hedged.

Derivative
Instruments Designated and Qualifying as a Net Investment in Foreign
Subsidiary

We use
foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of our net investment in our
foreign subsidiary, Lincoln UK.  The foreign currency forwards
obligate us to deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date at a
specified exchange rate. The foreign currency forwards outstanding as of
December 31, 2008, were terminated on February 5, 2009.  The gain on
the termination of the foreign currency forward of $38 million was recorded in
OCI.  During 2009, we entered into foreign currency forward to hedge a
significant portion of the foreign currency fluctuations associated with the
expected proceeds from the sale of Lincoln UK.  The loss upon the
termination of these foreign currency contracts of $12 million was also recorded
in OCI.

Derivative
Instruments Not Designated and Not Qualifying as Hedging
Instruments

We use
various other derivative instruments for risk management and income generation
purposes that either do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or have not
currently been designated by us for hedge accounting treatment.

Interest
Rate Cap Agreements

Interest
rate cap agreements entitle us to receive quarterly payments from the
counterparties on specified future reset dates, contingent on future interest
rates.  For each cap, the amount of such quarterly payments, if any,
is determined by the excess of a market interest rate over a specified cap rate,
multiplied by the notional amount divided by four.  The purpose of our
interest rate cap agreement program is to provide a level of protection from the
effect of rising interest rates for our annuity business, within our Retirement
Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution
segments.  The interest rate cap agreements provide an economic hedge
of the annuity line of business.  However, the interest rate cap
agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.


Interest
Rate Futures and Equity Futures

We use
interest rate futures and equity futures contracts to hedge the liability
exposure on certain options in variable annuity products.  These
futures contracts require payment between our counterparty and us on a daily
basis for changes in the futures index price.  Cash settlements on the
change in market value of financial futures contracts, along with the resulting
gains or losses, are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as
specified in the table above.

Interest
Rate Swap Agreements

We use
interest rate swap agreements to hedge the liability exposure on certain options
in variable annuity products.  The change in market value and periodic
cash settlements are recorded as a component of realized gain (loss) on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Foreign
Currency Forwards

We use
foreign currency forward contracts to hedge dividends received from our
U.K.-based subsidiary, Lincoln UK.  The foreign currency forward
contracts obligate us to deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date
and a specified exchange rate.  The contract does not qualify
for hedge accounting under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB
ASC.  Therefore, all gains or losses on the foreign currency forward
contracts are recorded as a component of realized gain (loss) on our
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Credit
Default Swaps

We buy
credit default swaps to hedge against a drop in bond prices due to credit
concerns of certain bond issuers.  A credit default swap allows us to
put the bond back to the counterparty at par upon a default event by the bond
issuer.  A default event is defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay,
obligation acceleration or restructuring.  Our credit default swaps
are not currently qualified for hedge accounting treatment, as amounts are
insignificant.

We also
sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to
investors.  The credit default swaps hedge the investor against a drop
in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers.  A
credit default swap allows the investor to put the bond back to us at par upon a
default event by the bond issuer.  A default event is defined as
bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligation acceleration or
restructuring.

Information

underlying the associated collateral of our open credit default swaps for which
we are the seller as of December 31, 2009, if credit risk related contingent

Certain
of our credit default swap agreements contain contractual provisions that allow
for the netting of collateral with our counterparties related to all of our
collateralized financing transactions that we have outstanding.  In
the event that these netting agreements were not in place, fair values of the
associated investments, counterparties’ credit ratings as compared to ours and
specified thresholds that once exceeded result in the payment of cash would have
required that we post approximately $55 million as of December 31,
2009.

Total
Return Swaps

We use
total return swaps to hedge a portion of the liability related to our deferred
compensation plans.  We receive the total return on a portfolio of
indexes and pay a floating rate of interest.  Cash settlements on the
change in market value of the total return swaps along with the resulting gains
or losses recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as specified
in the table above.


Put
Options

We use
put options to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable
annuity products.  Put options are contracts that require
counterparties to pay us at a specified future date the amount, if any, by which
a specified equity index is less than the strike rate stated in the agreement,
applied to a notional amount.  The change in market value of the put
options along with the resulting gains or losses on terminations and expirations
are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as specified in the
table above.

Call
Options (Based on LNC Stock)

We use
call options on our stock to hedge the expected increase in liabilities arising
from SARs granted on our stock.  Call options hedging vested SARs are
not eligible for hedge accounting treatment.  The mark-to-market
changes are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as
specified in the table above.

Call
Options (Based on S&P 500)

We use
indexed annuity contracts to permit the holder to elect an interest rate return
or an equity market component, where interest credited to the contracts is
linked to the performance of the S&P 500.  Contract holders may
elect to rebalance index options at renewal dates, either annually or
biannually.  As of each renewal date, we have the opportunity to
re-price the indexed component by establishing participation rates, subject to
minimum guarantees.  We purchase call options that are highly
correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our contract holders, such
that we are economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current
reset period.  The mark-to-market of the options held generally
offsets the change in value of the embedded derivative within the indexed
annuity, both of which are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss) as specified in the table above.

Variance
Swaps

We use
variance swaps to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable
annuity products.  Variance swaps are contracts entered into at no
cost and whose payoff is the difference between the realized variance of an
underlying index and the fixed variance rate determined as of
inception.  The change in market value and resulting gains and losses
on terminations and expirations are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss) as specified in the table above.

Currency
Futures

We use
currency futures to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with certain options
in variable annuity products.  Currency futures exchange one currency
for another at a specified date in the future at a specified exchange
rate.  These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment;
therefore, all cash settlements along with the resulting gains or losses are
recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as specified in the
table above.

Embedded
Derivative Instruments Not Designated and Not Qualifying as Hedging
Instruments

Deferred Compensation
Plans

We have
certain deferred compensation plans that have embedded derivative
instruments.  The liability related to these plans varies based on the
investment options selected by the participants.  The liability
related to certain investment options selected by the participants is
marked-to-market through net income on our Consolidated Statements of Income
(Loss) as specified in the table above.

Indexed
Annuity Contracts

We
distribute indexed annuity contracts that permit the holder to elect an interest
rate return or an equity market component, where interest credited to the
contracts is linked to the performance of the S&P 500.  This
feature represents an embedded derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging
Topic of the FASB ASC. Contract holders may elect to rebalance index
options at renewal dates, either annually or biannually.  As of each
renewal date, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component by
establishing participation rates, subject to minimum guarantees.  We
purchase S&P 500 call options that are highly correlated to the portfolio
allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are economically
hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset
period.  The mark-to-market of the options held generally offsets the
change in value of the embedded derivative within the indexed annuity, both of
which are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as specified
in the table above.


Guaranteed
Living Benefit Embedded Derivative Reserves

We have
certain GLB variable annuity products with GWB and GIB features that are
embedded derivatives.  Certain features of these guarantees, notably
our GIB, 4LATER® and

Lincoln
Lifetime Income

SM

Advantage

features, have
elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under the Financial Services –
Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of
the FASB ASC (“benefit reserves”) and embedded derivatives accounted for under
the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
Topics of the FASB ASC (“embedded derivative reserves”). We calculate the
value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the
specific characteristics of each GLB feature.  The change in embedded
derivative reserves flows through our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss)
as specified in the table above.  As of December 31, 2009, we
had $23.5 billion of account values that were attributable to variable
annuities with a GWB feature and $9.3 billion of account values that
were attributable to variable annuities with a GIB feature.

We use a
hedging strategy designed to mitigate the risk and income statement volatility
caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and volatility
associated with GWB and GIB features.  The hedging strategy is
designed such that changes in the value of the hedge contracts due to changes in
equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities move in the opposite
direction of changes in embedded derivative reserves of the GWB and GIB caused
by those same factors. As part of our current hedging program, equity
markets, interest rates and volatility in market conditions are monitored on a
daily basis. We rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes in these
factors as needed.  While we actively manage our hedge positions,
these hedge positions may not be totally effective in offsetting changes in the
embedded derivative reserve due to, among other things, differences in timing
between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge
positions, extreme swings in the equity markets and interest rates, market
volatility, contract holder behavior, divergence between the performance of the
underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between the actual and
expected performance of the hedge instruments and our ability to purchase
hedging instruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and return
trade-off.

Reinsurance
Related Embedded Derivatives

We have
certain Modco and CFW reinsurance arrangements with embedded derivatives related
to the withheld assets of the related funds.  These derivatives are
considered total return swaps with contractual returns that are attributable to
various assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance
arrangements. Changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives as
they occur are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as
specified in the table above.  Offsetting these amounts are
corresponding changes in the estimated fair value of trading securities in
portfolios that support these arrangements.  During the first quarter
of 2009, the portion of the embedded derivative liability related to the funds
withheld reinsurance agreement on our disability income business was released
due to the rescission of the underlying reinsurance agreement.  See
Note 14 for additional details.

AFS
Securities Embedded Derivatives

We own
various debt securities that either contain call options to exchange the debt
security for other specified securities of the borrower, usually common stock,
or contain call options to receive the return on equity-like
indexes.  The change in fair value of these embedded derivatives flows
through our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as specified in the table
above.

Credit
Risk

We are
exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties on
various derivative contracts and reflect assumptions regarding the credit or
nonperformance risk.  The nonperformance risk is based upon
assumptions for each counterparty’s credit spread over the estimated weighted
average life of the counterparty exposure less collateral held.

As of December 31, 2009,
the nonperformance risk adjustment was $5 million. The credit risk
associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from
financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance
records.  Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all
derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement.  We are required to maintain
minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice in negotiating ISDA
agreements.  Under some ISDA agreements, our insurance subsidiaries
have agreed to maintain certain financial strength or claims-paying
ratings.  A downgrade below these levels could result in termination
of the derivatives contract, at which time any amounts payable by us would be
dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative
contract.  In certain transactions, we and the counterparty have
entered into a collateral support agreement requiring either party to post
collateral when net exposures exceed pre-determined thresholds.  These
thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating.  We do not believe
the inclusion of termination or collateralization events pose any material
threat to the liquidity position of any insurance subsidiary of the
Company.  The amount of such exposure is essentially the net
replacement cost or market value less collateral held for such agreements with
each counterparty if the net market value is in our favor.  As of
December 31, 2009, the exposure was $292 million.


The
amounts recognized (in millions) by S&P credit rating of counterparty as of
December 31, 2009, for which we had the right to reclaim cash collateral or were
obligated to return cash collateral, were as follows:

The
effective tax rate is a ratio of tax expense over pre-tax income
(loss).  Because the pre-tax loss of $137 million resulted in a tax
benefit of $127 million in 2008, the effective tax rate was not
meaningful.  The effective tax rate on pre-tax income (loss) from
continuing operations was lower than the prevailing corporate federal income tax
rate.  Included in tax-preferred investment income was a separate
account dividend received deduction benefit of $77 million, $81 million and $88
million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
exclusive of any prior years’ tax return adjustment.


The
federal income tax asset (liability) (in millions), which is included in other

We are
required to establish a valuation allowance for any gross deferred tax assets
that are unlikely to reduce taxes payable in future years’ tax
returns.  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we concluded that it was
more likely than not that all gross deferred tax assets will reduce taxes
payable in future years.

As of
December 31, 2009, LNC had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income
tax purposes of $104 million for Lincoln National Reinsurance Company (Barbados)
Limited (“LNBAR”) that expire in 2024.  The net operating losses of
LNBAR are subject to federal income tax limitations that only allow the net
operating losses to be used to offset future taxable income of the
subsidiary.  LNC also had net capital loss carryforwards of $320
million which will expire in 2014.  LNC believes that it is more
likely than not that the net operating losses and capital losses will be fully
utilized within the allowable carryforward period.

The
application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred
tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary, to reduce our
deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be
realizable.  Considerable judgment and the use of estimates are
required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so,
the amount of such valuation allowance.  In evaluating the need for a
valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including: the nature and
character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior
carryback years; future reversals of temporary differences; the length of time
carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we would employ to
avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused.  Although realization is not
assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets, including our capital loss deferred tax asset, will be
realized.


As
discussed in Note 2, we adopted new guidance in the Income Taxes Topic of the
FASB ASC on January 1, 2007.  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, $224
million and $184 million of our unrecognized tax benefits presented below, if
recognized, would have impacted our income tax expense and our effective tax
rate.  We anticipate a change to our unrecognized tax benefits during
2009 in the range of none to $63 million.  A reconciliation of the
unrecognized tax benefits (in millions) was as follows:

We
recognize interest and penalties accrued, if any, related to unrecognized tax
benefits as a component of tax expense.  During the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized interest and penalty expense
related to uncertain tax positions of $12 million, $2 million and $21 million,
respectively.  We had accrued interest and penalty expense related to
the unrecognized tax benefits of $86 million and $74 million as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively.

We are
subject to annual tax examinations from the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”).  During the third quarter of 2008, the IRS completed its
examination for tax years 2003 and 2004 resulting in a proposed
assessment.  We believe a portion of the assessment is inconsistent
with the existing law and are protesting it through the established IRS appeals
process.  We do not anticipate that any adjustments that might result
from such audits would be material to our consolidated results of operations or
financial condition.  We are currently under audit by the IRS for
years 2005 and 2006.  The Jefferson-Pilot subsidiaries acquired in the
April 2006 merger are subject to a separate IRS examination
cycle.  For the former Jefferson-Pilot Corporation and its
subsidiaries, the IRS is examining the tax year ended April 2,
2006.

8.  DAC,
VOBA, DSI and DFEL

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a decrease to income from
continuing operations totaling $263 million or $1.01 per diluted share, for a
reversion to the mean prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL as a
result of significant and sustained declines in the equity markets during
2008.  During 2009, we did not have a reversion to the mean
prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.  The pre-tax impact
for these items is included within the prospective unlocking line
items in the changes in DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL tables below.

Our
insurance companies cede insurance to other companies.  The portion of
risks exceeding each company’s retention limit is reinsured with other
insurers.  We seek reinsurance coverage within the businesses that
sell life insurance and annuities in order to limit our exposure to mortality
losses and enhance our capital management.


Under our
reinsurance program, we reinsure approximately 45% to 50% of the mortality risk
on newly issued non-term life insurance contracts and approximately 30% to 35%
of total mortality risk including term insurance contracts.  Our
policy for this program is to retain no more than $10 million on a single
insured life issued on fixed and VUL insurance
contracts.  Additionally, the retention per single insured life for
term life insurance and for corporate-owned life insurance is $2 million for
each type of insurance.  Portions of our deferred annuity business
have been reinsured on a Modco basis with other companies to limit our exposure
to interest rate risks.  As of December 31, 2009, the reserves
associated with these reinsurance arrangements totaled $995
million.  To cover products other than life insurance, we acquire
other insurance coverages with retentions and limits.

We obtain
reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as
well as financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers.  Our
reinsurance operations were acquired by Swiss Re in December 2001, through a
series of indemnity   reinsurance transactions.  Swiss
Re represents our largest reinsurance exposure.  Under the indemnity
reinsurance agreements, Swiss Re reinsured certain of our liabilities and
obligations.  As we are not relieved of our legal liability to the
ceding companies, the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured
contracts remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding
reinsurance receivable from Swiss Re, which totaled $3.0 billion as of December
31, 2009.  Swiss Re has funded a trust, with a balance of $1.9 billion
as of December 31, 2009, to support this business.  As a result of
Swiss Re’s S&P financial strength rating dropping below AA-, Swiss Re was
required to fund an additional trust of approximately $1.4 billion as of
December 31, 2009, to support this business.  Swiss Re funded the new trust
during the fourth quarter of 2009.  In addition to various remedies
that we would have in the event of a default by Swiss Re, we continue to hold
assets in support of certain of the transferred reserves.  These
assets are reported within trading securities or mortgage loans on real estate
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Our liabilities for funds
withheld and embedded derivatives as of December 31, 2009, included $1.3 billion
and $30 million, respectively, related to the business reinsured by Swiss
Re.

We
recorded the gain related to the indemnity reinsurance transactions on the
business sold to Swiss Re as a deferred gain in the liability section of our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The deferred gain is being amortized
into income at the rate that earnings on the reinsured business are expected to
emerge, over a period of 15 years.  During 2009, 2008 and 2007 we
amortized $50 million, $50 million and $55 million, after-tax, respectively, of
deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance.

Because
of ongoing uncertainty related to personal accident business, the reserves
related to these exited business lines carried on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets as of December 31, 2009, may ultimately prove to be either excessive or
deficient.  For instance, in the event that future developments
indicate that these reserves should be increased, LNC would record a current
period non-cash charge to record the increase in reserves.  Because
Swiss Re is responsible for paying the underlying claims to the ceding
companies, we would record a corresponding increase in reinsurance recoverable
from Swiss Re.  However, we are not permitted to take the full benefit
in earnings for the recording of the increase in the reinsurance recoverable in
the period of the change.  Rather, we would increase the deferred gain
recognized upon the closing of the indemnity reinsurance transaction with Swiss
Re and would report a cumulative amortization “catch-up” adjustment to the
deferred gain balance as increased earnings recognized in the period of
change.  Any amount of additional increase to the deferred gain above
the cumulative amortization “catch-up” adjustment must continue to be deferred
and will be amortized into income in future periods over the remaining period of
expected run-off of the underlying business.  We would not transfer
any cash to Swiss Re as a result of these developments.

In the
second quarter of 2007, we recognized increased reserves on the business sold
and recognized a deferred gain that is being amortized into income at the rate
that earnings are expected to emerge within a 15 year period.  This
adjustment resulted in a non-cash charge of $13 million, after-tax, to increase
reserves, which was partially offset by a cumulative “catch-up” adjustment to
the deferred gain amortization of $5 million, after-tax, for a total decrease to
net income of $8 million.  The impact of the accounting for reserve
adjustments related to this reinsurance treaty is excluded from our definition
of income from operations.

income business occurring during the year ended December 31, 2009.


10.  Goodwill
and Specifically Identifiable Intangible Assets

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill (in millions) by reportable segment
were as follows:

Included
in the acquisition accounting adjustments above were adjustments related to
income tax deductions recognized when stock options attributable to mergers were
exercised or the release of unrecognized tax benefits acquired through
mergers.

For our
acquisition of NCLS, during 2009, we impaired the estimated goodwill that arose
from the acquisition after giving consideration to the expected financial
performance and other relevant factors of this business.

We
perform a Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis on all of our reporting units at
least annually on October 1.  The Step 1 analysis for the reporting
units within our Insurance Solutions and Retirement Solutions segments utilizes
primarily a discounted cash flow valuation technique.  In determining
the estimated fair value of these reporting units, we incorporate consideration
of discounted cash flow calculations, the level of our own share price and
assumptions that market participants would make in valuing these reporting
units.  Our fair value estimations are based primarily on an in-depth
analysis of projected future cash flows and relevant discount rates, which
considered market participant inputs (“income approach”).  The
discounted cash flow analysis required us to make judgments about revenues,
earnings projections, capital market assumptions and discount
rates.  For our Media reporting unit, we primarily use discounted cash
flow calculations to determine the implied fair value for this reporting
unit.


As of
October 1, 2009 and 2008, we performed a Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis on
all of our reporting units.  All of our reporting units passed the
Step 1 analysis, except for our Media reporting unit, which required a Step 2
analysis to be completed.  In our Step 2 analysis, we estimated the
implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as determined by assigning
the reporting unit’s fair value determined in Step 1 to all of its net assets
(recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a
business combination at the date of the impairment test.  We utilized
very detailed forecasts of cash flows and market observable inputs in
determining a fair value of the net assets for each of the reporting units
similar to what would be estimated in a business combination between market
participants.  The implied fair value of goodwill for our Media
reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount; therefore, goodwill was
impaired and written down to its fair value for this reporting
unit.

The
2009 and 2008 impairment recorded in Other Operations for our media
business was a result of declines in current and forecasted advertising revenue
for the entire radio market.  Our impairment tests showed the implied
fair value of our Media reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount;
therefore, we recorded non-cash impairments of goodwill (set forth above) for
2009 and 2008 and specifically identifiable intangible assets set
forth below of $50 million and $217 million for 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

As of
March 31, 2009, we performed a Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis on all of our
reporting units as a result of our performing an interim test due to volatile
capital markets that provided indicators that a potential impairment could be
present.  All of our reporting units passed the Step 1 analysis,
except for our Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit, which required a
Step 2 analysis to be completed.  Based upon our Step 2 analysis, we
recorded goodwill impairment for the Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting
unit in the first quarter of 2009 for $600 million, which was attributable
primarily to higher discount rates driven by higher debt costs and equity market
volatility, deterioration in sales and declines in equity
markets.  There were no indicators of impairment as of December 31,
2009, due primarily to the continued improvement in the equity markets and lower
discount rates.

The gross
carrying amounts and accumulated amortization (in millions) for each major
specifically identifiable intangible asset class by reportable segment were as
follows:

(1)

No
      amortization recorded as the intangible asset has indefinite
      life.

(2)

We
      recorded mutual fund contract rights impairment of $1 million for the year
      ended December 31, 2009.

(3)

We
      recorded FCC licenses impairment of $49 million and $217 million for the
      year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
  respectively.

Future
estimated amortization of specifically identifiable intangible assets (in
millions) as of December 31, 2009 was as follows:

scenarios and assumptions, including those regarding expected market rates of
return and volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality

      2019.  We have the option to repurchase the outstanding notes by
      paying the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be
      redeemed and (ii) the make-whole amount, plus in each case any accrued and
      unpaid interest as of the date of redemption.  The make-whole
      amount is equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining
      scheduled payments on the senior notes, discounted to the date of
      redemption on a semi-annual basis, at a rate equal to the sum of the
      applicable treasury rate (as defined in the senior notes) plus 50 basis
      points.

(4)

On December 11, 2009, we issued
      6.25% fixed rate senior notes due 2020.  We have the option to

      principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the make-whole
      amount, plus in each case any accrued and unpaid interest as of the date
      of redemption.  The make-whole amount is equal to the sum of the
      present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the senior notes,
      discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis, at a rate
      equal to the sum of the applicable treasury rate (as defined in the senior
      notes) plus 45 basis points.


(5)

During
      the first quarter of 2009, we repurchased $78 million of our 7% capital
      securities due 2066.  The results of the extinguishment of debt
      were favorable by a ratio of 25 cents to one
  dollar.

(6)

During
      the first quarter of 2009, we repurchased $9 million of our 6.05% capital

Commercial
Paper, Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit (“LOCs”)

Commercial
paper, credit facilities and LOC debt programs (in millions) were as
follows:

(1)

Our
      borrowing capacity under this credit facility does not have an expiration
      date and continues while our investment in the FHLBI common stock remains
      outstanding.  We have pledged securities, included in fixed
      maturity AFS securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that are
      associated with this credit
facility.

Credit
facilities allow for borrowing or issuances of LOCs.  Because
commitments associated with LOCs may expire unused, these amounts do not
necessarily reflect our future cash funding requirements; however, the issuance
of LOCs reduces availability of funds from the credit
facilities.  These LOCs support our reinsurance needs and specific
treaties associated with our reinsurance business sold to Swiss Re in
2001.  LOCs are used primarily to satisfy the U.S. regulatory
requirements of domestic clients who have contracted with the reinsurance
subsidiaries not domiciled in the U.S. and for reserve credit provided by our
affiliated offshore reinsurance company to our domestic insurance companies for
ceded business.


Under the
credit agreements, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth
level.  In addition, the agreements contain covenants restricting our
ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are
not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our
assets.  As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such
covenants.

Shelf
Registration

We
currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to
issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred
stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units
and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.

Certain
Debt Covenants on Capital Securities

Our $1.5
billion in principal amount of capital securities outstanding contain certain
covenants that require us to make interest payments in accordance with an
alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”) if we determine that one of
the following triggers (“trigger events”) exists as of the 30th day prior to an
interest payment date (“determination date”):

·

LNL’s
      risk-based capital ratio is less than 175% (based on the most recent
      annual financial statement filed with the State of Indiana);
      or

·

The
      sum of our consolidated net income for the four trailing fiscal quarters
      ending on the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently
      completed quarter prior to the determination date is zero or negative;
      and

·

Our
      consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other
      comprehensive income and any increase in stockholders’ equity resulting
      from the issuance of preferred stock during a quarter) (“adjusted
      stockholders’ equity”) as of the most recently completed quarter and the
      end of the quarter that is two quarters before the most recently completed
      quarter, has declined by 10% or more as compared to the quarter that is
      ten fiscal quarters prior to the last completed quarter (the “benchmark
      quarter”).

The ACSM
would generally require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy our
obligation to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net
proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common
stock with an exercise price greater than the market price.  We would
have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events no longer
existed.  Our failure to pay interest pursuant to the ACSM will not
result in an event of default with respect to the capital securities nor will a
nonpayment of interest unless it lasts for ten consecutive years, although such
breaches may result in monetary damages to the holders of the capital
securities.

14.  Contingencies
and Commitments

Contingencies

Regulatory
and Litigation Matters

Regulatory
bodies, such as state insurance departments, the SEC, Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority and other regulatory bodies regularly make inquiries and
conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among
other things, insurance laws, securities laws and laws governing the activities
of broker-dealers.

In the
ordinary course of its business, LNC and its subsidiaries are involved in
various pending or threatened legal proceedings, including purported class
actions, arising from the conduct of business.  In some instances,
these proceedings include claims for unspecified or substantial punitive damages
and similar types of relief in addition to amounts for alleged contractual
liability or requests for equitable relief.  After consultation with
legal counsel and a review of available facts, it is management’s opinion that
these proceedings, after consideration of any reserves and rights to
indemnification, ultimately will be resolved without materially affecting the
consolidated financial position of LNC.  However, given the large and
indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these proceedings and the inherent
difficulty in predicting the outcome of such legal proceedings, including the
proceeding described below, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain
matters could be material to our operating results for any particular reporting
period.

Transamerica Investment Management,
LLC and Transamerica Investments Services, Inc. v. Delaware Management Holdings,
Inc. (dba Delaware Investments), Delaware Investment Advisers and certain
individuals

, was filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court on
April 28, 2005.  The plaintiffs are seeking substantial
compensatory and punitive damages.  The complaint alleges breach of
fiduciary duty, breach of duty of loyalty, breach of contract, breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition,
interference with prospective economic advantage, conversion, unjust enrichment
and conspiracy, in connection with Delaware Investment Advisers’ hiring of a
portfolio management team from the plaintiffs.  We and the individual
defendants dispute the allegations and are vigorously defending these
actions.  The sale of Delaware has no impact on this
matter.

Commitments

Rescission
of Indemnity Reinsurance for Disability Income Business

Included
in the business sold to Swiss Re through indemnity reinsurance in 2001 was
disability income business.  In response to the rescission award of a
panel of arbitrators on January 24, 2009, of the underlying reinsurance
agreement with Swiss Re, we recorded an adjustment to write down our reinsurance
recoverable and the corresponding funds withheld liability, and we released the
embedded derivative liability related to the funds withheld nature of the
reinsurance agreement, as discussed below.  The rescission resulted in
our being responsible for paying claims on the business and maintaining
sufficient reserves to support the liabilities.

For the
year ended December 31, 2009, an unfavorable adjustment of $97 million,
after-tax, was reflected in segment income from operations within Other
Operations, comprised of increases of $129 million to benefits, $15 million to
interest credited and $5 million to underwriting, acquisition, insurance and
other expenses, partially offset by a tax benefit of $52 million.  In
addition, during 2009 the embedded derivative liability release discussed above
increased net income by approximately $31 million.  The combined
adjustments reduced net income by approximately $66 million,
after-tax.  As a result of the rescission, we reduced our reinsurance
recoverables by approximately $900 million related to the reserves for the
disability income business and reduced our funds withheld liability by
approximately $840 million.


Leases

Certain
subsidiaries of ours lease their home office properties through sale-leaseback
agreements.  The agreements provide for a 25-year lease period with
options to renew for six additional terms of five years each.  The
agreements also provide us with the right of first refusal to purchase the
properties during the terms of the lease, including renewal periods, at a price
defined in the agreements.  We also have the option to purchase the
leased properties at fair market value as defined in the agreements on the last
day of the initial 25-year lease period or the last day of any of the renewal
periods.  In 2006, we exercised the right and option to extend the
Fort Wayne lease for two extended terms such that the lease shall expire in
2019.  We retain our right and option to exercise the remaining four
extended terms of five years each in accordance with the lease
agreement.  In 2007, we exercised the right and option to extend the
Hartford lease for one extended term such that the lease shall expire in
2013.  During 2007, we moved our corporate headquarters to Radnor,
Pennsylvania from Philadelphia and entered into a new 13-year lease for office
space.

Total
rental expense on operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007 was $55 million, $62 million and $62 million,
respectively.  Future minimum rental commitments (in millions) as of
December 31, 2009 were as follows:

Information
Technology Commitment

In
February 1998, we signed a seven-year contract with IBM Global Services for
information technology services for the Fort Wayne operations.  In
February 2004, we completed renegotiations and extended the contract through
February 2010.  Following the original termination date of this agreement,
we have contractual rights to extend this agreement for up to two additional
years.  We have executed one of the optional extensions to extend the
contract through February 2011.  Annual costs are dependent on usage
but are expected to be approximately $9 million.

Football
Stadium Naming Rights Commitment

In 2002,
we entered into an agreement with the Philadelphia Eagles to name the Eagles’
new stadium Lincoln Financial Field.  In exchange for the naming
rights, we agreed to pay $140 million over a 20-year period through annual
payments to the Eagles, which average approximately $7 million per
year.  The total amount includes a maximum annual increase related to
the Consumer Price Index.  This future commitment has not been
recorded as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as it is being
accounted for in a manner consistent with the accounting for operating leases
under the Leases Topic of the FASB ASC.

Media
Commitments

Lincoln
Financial Media has future commitments of approximately $30 million through 2013
related primarily to employment contracts and rating service
contracts.

Vulnerability
from Concentrations

As of
December 31, 2009, we did not have a concentration of:  business
transactions with a particular customer or lender; sources of supply of labor or
services used in the business; or a market or geographic area in which business
is conducted that makes it vulnerable to an event that is at least reasonably
possible to occur in the near term and which could cause a severe impact to our
financial position.


Although
we do not have any significant concentration of customers, our American Legacy
Variable Annuity (“ALVA”) product offered in our Retirement Solutions –
Annuities segment is significant to this segment.  The ALVA product
accounted for 28%, 37% and 46% of Retirement Solutions – Annuities’ variable
annuity product deposits in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and represented
approximately 61%, 62% and 66% of our total Retirement Solutions – Annuities’
variable annuity product account values as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  In addition, fund choices for certain of our other
variable annuity products offered in our Retirement Solutions – Annuities
segment include American Fund Insurance Series

SM

(“AFIS”) funds.  For the Retirement Solutions – Annuities
segment, AFIS funds accounted for 33%, 44% and 55% of variable annuity product
deposits in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and represented 69%, 70% and 75%
of the segment’s total variable annuity product account values as of December
31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Standby
Real Estate Equity Commitments

Historically,
we have entered into standby commitments, which obligated us to purchase real
estate at a specified cost if a third-party sale does not occur within
approximately one year after construction is completed.  These
commitments were used by a developer to obtain a construction loan from an
outside lender on favorable terms.  In return for issuing the
commitment, we received an annual fee and a percentage of the profit when the
property is sold.  Our long-term expectation is that we will be
obligated to fund a small portion of these commitments that remain
outstanding.  However, due to the current economic environment, we may
experience increased funding obligations.

As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had standby real estate equity commitments
totaling $220 million and $267 million, respectively.  During 2009, we
funded commitments of $46 million and the fair value of the associated real
estate of $32 million is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which
resulted in the recognition of $14 million in realized losses.  In
addition, we recorded an estimated loss of $69 million in 2009 on projects due
to our belief that our requirement to fund the projects in accordance with the
standby equity commitment is probable.  During the year ended December
31, 2009, we recorded $83 million to realized loss on our Consolidated Statement
of Income (Loss).

During
2009, we suspended entering into new standby real estate
commitments.

Other
Contingency Matters

State
guaranty funds assess insurance companies to cover losses to contract holders of
insolvent or rehabilitated companies.  Mandatory assessments may be
partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some
states.  We have accrued for expected assessments net of estimated
future premium tax deductions of $14 million and $11 million as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively.

Guarantees

We have
guarantees with off-balance-sheet risks having contractual values of zero and $1
million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, whose contractual
amounts represent credit exposure.  Certain of our subsidiaries have
sold commercial mortgage loans through grantor trusts, which issued pass-through
certificates.  These subsidiaries have agreed to repurchase any
mortgage loans which remain delinquent for 90 days at a repurchase price
substantially equal to the outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest
thereon to the date of repurchase.  In case of default by borrowers,
we have recourse to the underlying real estate.  It is management’s
opinion that the value of the properties underlying these commitments is
sufficient that in the event of default, the impact would not be material to
us.  These guarantees expired in 2009.  Our assessment of
the off-balance-sheet risk was based upon the borrower’s credit rating of
Baa1.

Tax
Matters

Changes
to the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings or court decisions could
increase our effective tax rate.  In this regard, on August 16,
2007, the IRS issued a revenue ruling that purports, among other things, to
modify the calculation of the separate account dividends-received deduction
received by life insurance companies.  Subsequently, the IRS issued
another revenue ruling that suspended the August 16, 2007, ruling and
announced a new regulation project on the issue.  See Note 7 for the
impact of the separate account dividends-received deduction on our effective tax
rate.

Common
Stock Issued

On
June 22, 2009, we closed on the issuance and sale of 40,000,000 shares of
common stock and on June 25, 2009, we closed on the issuance and sale of
6,000,000 shares of common stock, both at a price of $15.00 per
share.

Series
B Preferred Stock Issued

On July
10, 2009, in connection with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) Capital
Purchase Program (“CPP”), established as part of the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”), we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury
950,000 shares of Series B preferred stock together with a related warrant to
purchase up to 13,049,451 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
$10.92 per share, in accordance with the terms of the TARP CPP, for an aggregate
purchase price of $950 million

.  The Series B
preferred stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to our common
stock

.

Holders

of this Series B preferred
stock are entitled to a cumulative cash dividend at the annual rate per share of
5% of the liquidation

preference, $1,000 per share, or $48 million
annually, for the first five years from issuance.  After July 10,
2014, if the preferred shares are still outstanding, the annual dividend rate
will increase to 9% per year.  The warrant will expire on July 10,
2019.

As
required under the TARP CPP, dividend payments on, and repurchases of, the
Company’s outstanding preferred and common stock are subject to certain
restrictions (unless the U.S. Treasury consents).  Additionally, any
increase in the quarterly common stock dividend for the next three years will
require the consent of the U.S. Government while our obligations under the CPP
remain outstanding.

In
general, the Treasury Department will not vote the Series B preferred
stock.  However, with respect to the Series B preferred stock, the
Treasury Department will have class voting rights on the issuance of share
ranking senior to the Series B preferred stock, amendments to the rights of the
Series B preferred stock or any merger, exchange or similar transaction which
would adversely affect the rights of the Series B preferred
stock.  However, if dividends on the Series B preferred stock are not
paid in full for six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the Series B
will have the right to elect two directors.


Upon
issuance, the fair values of the Series B preferred stock and the
associated warrant were computed as if the instruments were issued on a stand
alone basis. The fair value of the Series B preferred stock was estimated
based on a five-year holding period and cash flows discounted at a rate of 10%,
resulting in a fair value estimate of approximately $777 million. We used a
binomial lattice model to estimate the fair value of the warrant, resulting in a
stand alone fair value of approximately $152 million.  The relative
fair value of each security to the total combined fair value of both securities
was 83.6% for the preferred stock and 16.4% for the common stock
warrant.  The most significant and unobservable assumption in this
valuation was our share price volatility.  We used a long-term
realized volatility of our stock of 73.17%.

The
individual fair values were used to record the Series B preferred stock and
associated warrant on a relative fair value basis of $794 million and $156
million, respectively.  The warrant was recorded to common
stock.  The Series B preferred stock amount was recorded at the
liquidation value of $1,000 per share or $950 million, net of discount of
$156 million.  The discount is being amortized over a five-year period
from the date of issuance, using the effective yield method and is recorded as a
direct reduction to retained earnings and deducted from income (loss) available
to common stockholders in the calculation of EPS.  The accretion of
discount totaled $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

A
reconciliation of the denominator (number of shares) in the calculations of
basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share was as follows:

As
      a result of a loss from continuing operations for the year ended December
      31, 2009, shares used in the EPS calculation represent basic shares, since
      using diluted shares would have been anti-dilutive to the
      calculation.

In the
event the average market price of LNC common stock exceeds the issue price of
stock options, such options would be dilutive to our EPS and will be shown in
the table above.

The
income used in the calculation of our diluted EPS is our net income (loss),
reduced by preferred stock dividends and accretion of discount along with our
minority interest adjustments related to outstanding stock options under the
Delaware Investments U.S., Inc. (“DIUS”) stock option incentive plan of less
than $1 million, less than $1 million and $2 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  These amounts are presented on our Consolidated

All
merger-related and restructuring charges are included in underwriting,

our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) in the year incurred.

Restructuring Plan

Starting
in December 2008, we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the
economic downturn and sustained market volatility, which focused on reducing
expenses.  Our cumulative pre-tax charges amounted to $42 million for
severance, benefits and related costs associated with the plan for workforce
reduction and other restructuring actions.

Restructuring Plan

Upon
completion of the merger with Jefferson-Pilot, we implemented a restructuring
plan relating to the integration of our legacy operations with those of
Jefferson-Pilot.  The purpose of the realignment was to enhance
productivity, efficiency and scalability while positioning us for future
growth.

Details
underlying reserves for restructuring charges (in millions) were as

do not qualify as restructuring charges that are associated with the integration
activities.  Merger integration costs relating to employee severance
and termination benefits of $13 million were included in other liabilities on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets in the purchase price allocation.  In
the first quarter of 2007, an additional $8 million was recorded to goodwill and
other liabilities as part of the final adjustment to the purchase price
allocation related to employee severance and termination benefits.

18.  Pension,
Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefit Plans

We
maintain U.S. qualified funded defined benefit pension plans in which many of
our U.S. employees and agents are participants.  We also maintain
non-qualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain U.S. employees
and agents, certain former employees of Jefferson-Pilot and certain employees
from CIGNA Corporation.  In addition, for certain former employees we
have supplemental retirement plans that provide defined benefit pension benefits
in excess of limits imposed by federal tax law.  All of our U.S.
defined benefit pension plans were “frozen” as of December 31, 2007, or
earlier.  For our frozen plans, there are no new participants and no
future accruals of benefits from the date of the freeze.  Our non-U.S.
defined benefit pension plan was frozen as of September 30, 2009 as a result of
the sale of Lincoln National UK.

The
eligibility requirements for each plan are described in each plan document and
vary for each plan based on completion of a specified period of continuous
service or date of hire, subject to age limitations.  The frozen
pension plan benefits are calculated either on a traditional or cash balance
formula.  Those formulas are based upon years of credited service and
eligible earnings as defined in each plan document.  The traditional
formula provides benefits stated in terms of a single life annuity payable at
age 65.  Under the cash balance formula benefits are stated as a lump
sum hypothetical account balance.  That account balance equals the sum
of the employee’s accumulated annual benefit credits plus interest
credits.  Benefit credits, which are based on years of service and
base salary plus bonus, ceased as of the date the plan was
frozen.  Interest Credits continue until the employee’s benefit is
paid.

We also
sponsor a voluntary employees’ beneficiary association (“VEBA”) trust that
provides postretirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits to retired
full-time U.S. employees and agents who, depending on the plan, have worked for
us for 10 years and attained age 55 (age 60 for agents).  VEBAs are a
special type of tax-exempt trust used to provide employee benefits that are
subject to preferential tax treatment under the Internal Revenue
Code.  Medical and dental benefits are available to spouses and other
eligible dependents of retired employees and agents.  Retirees may be
required to contribute toward the cost of these benefits.  Eligibility
and the amount of required contribution for these benefits varies based upon a
variety of factors including years of service and year of
retirement.  Effective January 1, 2008, the postretirement plan
providing benefits to former employees of Jefferson-Pilot was amended such that
only employees who had attained age 55 with a minimum of 10 years of service by
December 31, 2007, and who later retire on or after age 60 with 15 years of
service will be eligible to receive life insurance benefits when they
retire.


Obligations,
Funded Status and Assumptions

Information
(in millions) with respect to our defined benefit plan asset activity and
defined benefit plan obligations was as follows:


Consistent
with our benefit plans’ year end, we use December 31 as the measurement
date.

The
discount rate was determined based on a corporate yield curve as of December 31,
2009, and projected benefit obligation cash flows for the U.S. pension
plans.  We reevaluate this assumption each plan year.  For
2010, our discount rate for the U.S. pension plans will be 6%.

The
expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical and expected
future returns of the various asset categories, using the plan’s target plan
allocation.  We reevaluate this assumption each plan
year.  For 2010, our expected return on plan assets is 8.00% for the
U.S. plans and 5.80% for the non-U.S. plans.  The approximate expected
return on plan assets by asset class for the pension plans is as
follows:

The
calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a
weighted-average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered
benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) was as follows:

As
      of December 31,

Year
      that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate




In order
to improve the measurement of the heath care trend rate with industry trends and
practice, we separated our trend rate to assess the pre-65 and post-65
populations separately for the year ended December 31, 2009 and
2008.  We expect the health care cost trend rate for 2010 to be 9.5%
for pre-65 and 9.5% for the post-65 population.  The health care cost
trend rate assumption is a key percentage that affects the amounts
reported.  A one-percentage point increase in assumed health care cost
trend rates would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $1 million and total service and interest cost components by less
than $1 million.  A one-percentage point decrease in assumed health
care cost trend rates would have decreased the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation by $2 million and total service and interest cost components
by less than $1 million.

of Net Periodic Benefit Cost

The
components of net defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefit plan
expense (in millions) were as follows:

(1)

Amounts
      for our pension plans in 2009 and 2008 represent general and
      administrative expenses.

We expect
our 2010 U.S pension plans’ expense to be approximately $14
million.  In addition, we retained the Lincoln UK
pension plan after the sale of this business, and we expect
our related pension expense for 2010 to be approximately $1 million
when assuming an average exchange rate of 1.75 pounds sterling to U.S. dollars,
which will be reflected within Other Operations.

For 2010,
the estimated amount of amortization from accumulated OCI into net periodic
benefit expense related to net actuarial loss or gain is expected to be
approximately $15 million loss for our pension benefit plan and less than $1
million gain for our postretirement benefit plan.

The
primary investment objective for the assets related to our U.S. defined benefit
pension plan is for capital appreciation with an emphasis on avoiding undue
risk.  Investments can be made in various asset classes and styles,
including, but not limited to: domestic and international equity, fixed income
securities and other asset classes the investment managers deem
prudent.  Three- and five-year time horizons are utilized as there are
inevitably short-run fluctuations, which will cause variations in investment
performance.

Our
defined benefit plan assets have been combined into a master retirement trust
where a variety of qualified managers, with Northern Trust as the manager of
managers, are expected to rank in the upper 50% of similar funds over the
three-year periods and above an appropriate index over five-year
periods.  Managers are monitored for adherence to approved investment
policy guidelines, changes in material factors and legal or regulatory
actions.  Managers not meeting these criteria are subject to
additional due diligence review, corrective action or possible
termination.

Fair
Value of Plan Assets

See “Fair
Value Hierarchy” in Note 1 for discussion of how we categorize our
pension plan assets, into a three-level fair value hierarchy.


The
following summarizes our fair value measurements of pension plan assets (in
millions) on a recurring basis by the three-level fair value
hierarchy:


The
following summarizes changes to our U.S. pension plan assets (in millions)
classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as reported
above:

Valuation
Methodologies and Associated Inputs for Pension Plan Assets

The fair
value measurements of our plan assets are based on assumptions used by market
participants in pricing the security.  The most appropriate valuation
methodology is selected based on the specific characteristics of the security,
and the valuation methodology is consistently applied to measure the security’s
fair value.  The fair value measurement is based on a market approach,
which utilizes prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable securities.  Sources of
inputs to the market approach include third-party pricing services, independent
broker quotations or pricing matrices.  Both observable and
unobservable inputs are used in the valuation
methodologies.  Observable inputs include benchmark yields, reported
trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark
securities, bids, offers and reference data.  In addition, market
indicators, industry and economic events are monitored and further market data
is acquired if certain triggers are met. For certain security types,
additional inputs may be used, or some of the inputs described above may not be
applicable.  For broker-quoted only securities, quotes from market
makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized to be market
participants. In order to validate the pricing information and
broker-dealer quotes, procedures are employed, where possible, that include
comparisons with similar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent
sales, discussions with brokers and observations of general market movements for
those security classes.  For those securities trading in less liquid
or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information, unobservable inputs
are used in order to measure the fair value of these securities.  In
cases where this information is not available, such as for privately placed
securities, fair value is estimated using an internal pricing
matrix.  This matrix relies on judgment concerning the discount rate
used in calculating expected future cash flows, credit quality, industry sector
performance and expected maturity.

Prices
received from third parties are not adjusted; however, the third-party pricing
services’ valuation methodologies and related inputs are evaluated and
additional evaluation is performed to determine the appropriate level within the
fair value hierarchy.

The
observable and unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies are based on
general standard inputs.  The standard inputs used in order of
priority are benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer
spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference
data.  Depending on the type of security or the daily market activity,
standard inputs may be prioritized differently or may not be available for all
securities on any given day.

Cash and
invested cash is carried at cost, which approximates fair value.  This
category includes highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less.  Due to the nature of these assets, we believe
these assets should be classified as Level 2.


Plan
Cash Flows

It is our
practice to make contributions to the qualified pension plans to comply with
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended.  In accordance with such practice, no contributions
were made nor required for the years ended December 31, 2009 or
2008.  No contributions are required nor expected to be made in
2010.

We expect
the following benefit payments (in millions):

19.  Defined
Contribution and Deferred Compensation Plans

Defined
Contribution Plans

We
sponsor contributory defined contribution plans for eligible employees and
agents, which includes money purchase plans (“MPP”).  We make
contributions and matching contributions to each of the active plans in
accordance with the plan document and various limitations under Section 401(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

The
expenses (in millions) for our 401(k) plans and MPP were as

Deferred
Compensation Plans

We
sponsor six separate non-qualified unfunded, deferred compensation plans for
various groups:  employees; agents; non-employee directors; and
certain agents.

The terms
of the plans provide that plan participants who select our stock as the measure
for their investment return will receive shares of our stock in settlement of
this portion of their accounts at the time of distribution.  In
addition, participants are precluded from diversifying any portion of their
deferred compensation plan account that has been credited to the stock unit
fund.  Consequently, changes in value of our stock do not affect the
expenses associated with this portion of the deferred compensation
plan.

The
investment earnings expenses for certain investment options within the
respective plans are hedged by total return swaps.  Participant's account
values increase or decrease due to investment earnings driven by market
fluctuation.  Our expenses increase or decrease in direct proportion to the
market's change for the participants’ investment options.  The total return
swaps allow us to minimize the investment earnings expenses. 
Presented below for the respective plans we have netted the investment earnings
due to market fluctuation with the results of the total return swaps.  For
further discussion on our total return swaps related to our deferred
compensation plans, see Note 6.

The
Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees

Eligible
participants in this plan may elect to defer payment of a portion of their
compensation as defined by the plan.  Plan participants may select
from a menu of “phantom” investment options (identical to those offered under
our qualified savings plans) used as investment measures for calculating the
investment return notionally credited to their deferrals.  Under the
terms of the plan, we agree to pay out amounts based upon the aggregate
performance of the investment measures selected by the
participant.  We make matching contributions to these plans based upon
amounts placed into the deferred compensation plans by individuals after
participants have exceeded applicable limits of the Internal Revenue
Code.  The amount of our contribution is calculated in accordance with
the plan document, which is similar to our 401(k) plans.  Expenses (in

based upon the aggregate performance of the investment measures selected by the
participant.  We make matching contributions to these plans based upon

Deferred
Compensation Plan for Former Jefferson-Pilot Agents

Eligible
former agents of Jefferson-Pilot may participate in this deferred compensation
plan. Eligible agents are allowed to defer commissions and bonuses and specify
where these deferral commissions will be invested in selected mutual
funds.  Agents participate in the plan with the understanding that the
return on these funds cannot be received until a specified age or in the event
of a significant lifestyle change.  The funded amount is rebalanced to
match the funds that have been elected under the agent compensation
plan.  The plan obligation increases with contributions, deferrals and
investment income, and decreases with withdrawals and investment losses. 
The plan’s assets increase with investment gains and decrease with
investment losses and payouts of death benefits.  Expenses (income)
for this plan were $1 million, ($2) million and $1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Our
401(k) and deferred compensation plans or portions there of that were part of
the Delaware sale are not reflected within the amounts reported
above.  See Note 3 for additional information regarding the sale of
Delaware.

20.  Stock-Based
Incentive Compensation Plans

LNC
Stock-Based Incentive Plans

We
sponsor various incentive plans for our employees and directors, and for the
employees and agents of our subsidiaries that provide for the issuance of stock
options, SARS, restricted stock awards, performance shares (“shares”)
(performance-vested shares as opposed to time-vested shares) and deferred stock
units (“restricted stock units”).  We have a policy of issuing new
shares to satisfy option exercises.

Total
compensation expense (in millions) for all of our stock-based incentive
compensation plans was as follows:

Total
unrecognized compensation expense (in millions) for all of our stock-based
incentive compensation plans was as follows:


In the
second quarter of 2009, a performance period from 2009-2011 was approved for our
executive officers by the Compensation Committee. The award for executive
officers participating in this performance period consists of LNC restricted
stock units representing approximately 27%, LNC stock options representing
approximately 40% and performance cash awards representing approximately 33% of
the total award. LNC stock options granted for this performance period vest
ratably over the three-year period, based solely on a service
condition.  Under the 2009-2011 plan, a total of 609,175 LNC stock
options and 902,269 LNC restricted stock units were granted.  In
addition, as required under TARP CPP, we have complied with enhanced
compensation restrictions for certain executives and employees.

In the
first quarter of 2008, a performance period from 2008-2010 was approved for our
executive officers by the Compensation Committee.  Executive officers
participating in the 2008-2010 performance period received one-half of their
award in LNC stock options with 10-year terms, with the remainder of the award
in a combination of performance shares and cash.  LNC stock options
granted for this performance period vest ratably over the three-year
period.  All awards granted during this period vest solely based on
meeting service conditions.  Depending on performance results for this
period, the ultimate payout of performance shares and cash could range from zero
to 200% of the target award.  Under the 2008 long-term incentive
compensation program, a total of 1,564,800 LNC stock options were granted and
218,308 LNC performance shares were awarded.

In the
first quarter of 2007, a performance period from 2007-2009 was approved for our
executive officers by the Compensation Committee.  Executive officers
participating in the 2007-2009 performance period received one-half of their
award in LNC stock options with 10-year terms, with the remainder of the award
in a combination of performance shares and cash.  LNC stock options
granted for this performance period vest ratably over the three-year
period.  All options granted during this period vest solely based on
meeting service conditions.  Depending on performance results for this
period, the ultimate payout of performance shares and cash could range from zero
to 200% of the target award.  Under the 2007 long-term incentive
compensation program, a total of 942,932 LNC stock options were granted and
126,879 LNC performance shares were awarded.

For the
three-year performance period 2007-2009, the performance measures and goals used
to determine the ultimate number of performance shares granted (and cash paid)
were established at the beginning of the performance
period.  Depending on the performance results, the actual number of
shares granted and cash paid could have ranged from zero to 200% of the target
award.  Performance share awards were granted at target at the
beginning of the cycle, but vested based on performance.  Performance
over target resulted in the grant of shares of LNC common
stock.  Actual performance under target resulted in the forfeiture
(not vesting) of target options.

The
option price assumptions used for our stock option incentive plans were as

grant relative to the number of options exercised over the previous three-year
period.

Stock
Appreciation Rights

Under our
Incentive Compensation Plan, we issue SARs to certain planners and advisors who
have full-time contracts with us.  The SARs under this program are
rights on our stock that are cash settled and become exercisable in increments
of 25% over the four-year period following the SARs grant date.  SARs
are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock
at the date of grant and, unless cancelled earlier due to certain terminations
of employment, expire five years from the date of grant.  Generally,
such SARs are transferable only upon death.

We
recognize compensation expense for SARs based on the fair value method using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  Compensation expense and the
related liability are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period of the SARs.  The SARs liability is marked-to-market through
net income, which causes volatility in net income as a result of changes in the
market value of our stock.  We have hedged a portion of this
volatility by purchasing call options on LNC stock.  Call options
hedging vested SARs are also marked-to-market through net income.  The
mark-to-market gains (losses) recognized through net income on the call options
on LNC stock for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were zero,
$(8) million and $(3)  million, respectively.  The SARs
liability as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $1 million and zero,
respectively.

21.  Statutory
Information and Restrictions

The
Company’s domestic life insurance subsidiaries prepare financial statements in
accordance with statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) prescribed or permitted
by the insurance departments of their states of domicile, which may vary
materially from GAAP.  Prescribed SAP includes the Accounting
Practices and Procedures Manual of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners (“NAIC”) as well as state laws, regulations and administrative
rules.  Permitted SAP encompasses all accounting practices not so
prescribed.  The principal differences between statutory financial
statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are that
statutory financial statements do not reflect DAC, some bond portfolios may be
carried at amortized cost, assets and liabilities are presented net of
reinsurance, contract holder liabilities are generally valued using more
conservative assumptions and certain assets are non-admitted.

Statutory
capital and surplus; net gain from operations, after-tax;  net income
(loss) and dividends to LNC Parent Company amounts (in millions) below consists
of all or a combination of the following entities: LNL, First Penn-Pacific Life
Insurance Company, Lincoln Reinsurance Company of South Carolina, Lincoln
Reinsurance Company of South Carolina II, The Lincoln Life & Annuity Company
of New York (“LLANY”), Lincoln Financial Group South Carolina Reinsurance
Company, and Lincoln Reinsurance Company of Vermont I.

The
increase in statutory net income for the year ended December 31, 2009, from that
of 2008 was primarily due to the improved market conditions in
2009.  The new statutory reserving standard (commonly called
“VACARVM”) that was developed by the NAIC replaced current statutory reserve
practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, such as GWBs, and was
effective December 31, 2009.  The actual effect of adoption was
relatively neutral to RBC ratios and future dividend capacity of our insurance
subsidiaries with a slight decrease in statutory reserves offset by a higher
capital requirement.  We utilize captive reinsurance structures, as
well as third-party reinsurance arrangements, to lessen the negative impact on
statutory capital and dividend capacity in our life insurance
subsidiaries.

The
decline in statutory net income in 2008 from that of 2007 was primarily due to a
significant increase in realized losses on investments combined with reserve
strain due to deteriorating market conditions throughout 2008.

The
states of domicile of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries have adopted certain
prescribed accounting practices that differ from those found in NAIC
SAP.  These prescribed practices are the use of continuous
Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method (“CARVM”) in the calculation of
reserves as prescribed by the state of New York and the calculation of reserves
on universal life policies based on the Indiana universal life method as
prescribed by the state of Indiana.  The insurance subsidiaries also
have several accounting practices permitted by the states of domicile that
differ from those found in NAIC SAP.  Specifically, these are
accounting for the lesser of the face amount of all amounts outstanding under an
LOC and the value of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation
(“XXX”) additional statutory reserves as an admitted asset and a form of surplus
as of December 31, 2009; the use of a more conservative valuation interest rate
on certain annuities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008; the use of less
conservative mortality tables on certain life insurance products as of December
31, 2008; and a less conservative standard in determining the admitted amount of
deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008.


The
effects on statutory surplus compared to NAIC statutory surplus from the use of
these prescribed and permitted practices (in millions) were as
follows:

Our
domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department
regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and the payment of dividends
to the holding company.  Under Indiana laws and regulations, our
Indiana insurance subsidiaries, LNL and First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance
Company, may pay dividends to LNC within the statutory limitations without prior
approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the
“Commissioner”).  The current statutory limitation is the greater of
10% of the insurer’s policyholders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual
statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from
operations for the previous twelve months.  If a proposed dividend,
along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive
months exceeds the statutory limitation, the insurance subsidiary must receive
prior approval of the Commissioner to pay such dividend.  Indiana law
gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in
excess of these limits.  LNC is also the holder of surplus notes
issued by LNL.  The payment of principal and interest on the surplus
notes to LNC must be approved by the Commissioner as well.  Generally,
these restrictions pose no short-term liquidity concerns for the holding
company.  LLANY, a wholly-owned subsidiary of LNL, is subject to
similar, but not identical, regulatory restrictions as our Indiana-domiciled
subsidiaries with regard to the transfer of funds and the payment of
dividends.  The NAIC allows our U.S. insurance subsidiaries to include
certain deferred tax assets in our statutory capital and surplus, but we are not
able to consider the benefit from this when calculating available
dividends.  We expect our life insurance subsidiaries could pay
dividends of approximately $730 million in 2010 without prior approval from the
respective insurance commissioners.


22.  Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
carrying values and estimated fair values of our financial instruments (in
millions) were as follows:

(1)

The
      difference between the carrying value and fair value of short-term debt as
      of December 31, 2009 and 2008, related to current maturities of long-term
      debt.

Valuation
Methodologies and Associated Inputs for Financial Instruments Not Carried at
Fair Value

The
following discussion outlines the methodologies and assumptions used to
determine the fair value of our financial instruments not carried at fair
value.  Considerable judgment is required to develop these assumptions
used to measure fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates shown are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a one-time,
current market exchange of all of our financial instruments.

Mortgage
Loans on Real Estate

The fair
value of mortgage loans on real estate is established using a discounted cash
flow method based on credit rating, maturity and future income.  The
ratings for mortgages in good standing are based on property type, location,
market conditions, occupancy, debt service coverage, loan to value, quality of
tenancy, borrower and payment record.  The fair value for impaired
mortgage loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s market price or the
fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

Other
Investments

The
carrying value of our assets classified as other investments on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets approximates their fair value.  Other investments
include LPs and other privately held investments that are accounted for using
the equity method of accounting.


Other
Contract Holder Funds

Other
contract holder funds on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include remaining
guaranteed interest and similar contracts and account values of certain
investment contracts.  The fair value for the remaining guaranteed
interest and similar contracts is estimated using discounted cash flow
calculations as of the balance sheet date.  These calculations are
based on interest rates currently offered on similar contracts with maturities
that are consistent with those remaining for the contracts being
valued.  As of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, the remaining
guaranteed interest and similar contracts carrying value approximates fair
value.  The fair value of the account values of certain investment
contracts is based on their approximate surrender value as of the balance sheet
date.

Short-term
and Long-term Debt

The fair
value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices or estimated using
discounted cash flow analysis determined in conjunction with our incremental
borrowing rate as of the balance sheet date for similar types of borrowing
arrangements where quoted prices are not available.  For short-term
debt, excluding current maturities of long-term debt, the carrying value
approximates fair value.

Guarantees

Our
guarantees relate to mortgage loan pass-through certificates.  Based
on historical performance where repurchases have been negligible and the current
status of the debt, none of the loans are delinquent and the fair value
liability for the guarantees related to mortgage loan pass-through certificates
is insignificant.

Financial
Instruments Carried at Fair Value

We did
not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis as of December 31, 2009, or December 31, 2008, and we noted no changes in
our valuation methodologies between these periods.


The
following summarizes our financial instruments carried at fair value (in
millions) on a recurring basis by the fair value hierarchy levels described
above:



The
following summarizes changes to our financial instruments carried at fair value
(in millions) and classified within Level 3 of the fair value

Information

We
provide products and services in two operating businesses and report results
through four business segments as follows:

Business

Corresponding
      Segments

Retirement
      Solutions

Annuities

Defined
      Contribution

Insurance
      Solutions

Life
      Insurance

Group
      Protection

We also
have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are
not directly related to the business segments.  Our reporting segments
reflect the manner by which our chief operating decision makers view and manage
the business.  The following is a brief description of these segments
and Other Operations.

Retirement
Solutions

The
Retirement Solutions business provides its products through two
segments:  Annuities and Defined Contribution.  The
Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth
and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed
annuities, including indexed annuities and variable annuities.  The
Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segment provides employer-sponsored
variable and fixed annuities and mutual-fund based programs in the 401(k),
403(b) and 457 marketplaces.

Insurance
Solutions

The
Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two
segments:  Life Insurance and Group Protection.  The
Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and
transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which
is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and
both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including corporate-owned
UL and VUL insurance and bank-owned UL and VUL insurance
products.  The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment offers
group life, disability and dental insurance to employers, and its products are
marketed primarily through a national distribution system of regional group
offices.  These offices develop business through employee benefit
brokers, third-party administrators and other employee benefit
firms.

Other
Operations

Other
Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance
subsidiaries; investments in media properties and other corporate investments;
benefit plan net liability; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity
reinsurance related to the sale of reinsurance to Swiss Re in 2001; the results
of certain disability income business due to the rescission of a reinsurance
agreement with Swiss Re; the Institutional Pension business, which is a
closed-block of pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group
annuity basis, and is currently in run-off; and external debt.  We are
actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance
and future value.


Segment
operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are internal measures used
by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate and assess the results of
our segments.  Income (loss) from operations is GAAP net income
excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as
applicable:

·

Realized
      gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized
      loss”):

§

Sale
      or disposal of securities;

§

Impairments
      of securities;

§

Change
      in the fair value of embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance
      arrangements and the change in the fair value of our trading
      securities;

§

Change
      in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our GDB riders within
      our variable annuities;

§

Change
      in the GLB embedded derivative reserves, net of the change in the fair
      value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded
      derivative reserves; and

§

Changes
      in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index
      call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index
      allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity
      products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair
      Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB
  ASC.

·

Change
      in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim
      Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC
      resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders (“benefit
      ratio unlocking”);

·

Income
      (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting
    standards;

·

Income
      (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold
      through reinsurance;

·

Gain
      (loss) on early extinguishment of
debt;

·

Losses
      from the impairment of intangible assets;
and

·

Income
      (loss) from discontinued
operations.

Operating
revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following
items, as applicable:

·

Excluded
      realized loss;

·

Amortization
      of DFEL arising from changes in GDB and GLB benefit ratio
      unlocking;

·

Amortization
      of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold
      through reinsurance; and

·

Revenue
      adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting
      standards.

We use
our prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 35% while taking into
account any permanent differences for events recognized differently in our
financial statements and federal income tax returns when reconciling our
non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure.  Operating
revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net
income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of
operations.

Controls
and Procedures

(a)

Conclusions
      Regarding Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period
required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act).  Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to
material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required
to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.

(b)

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial
  Reporting

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included on page 159 of
“Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and is
incorporated herein by reference.

A control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.  Further,
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud
will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
the company have been detected.  Projections of any evaluation of
controls’ effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.  Over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures.

(c)

Changes
      in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

There was
no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is
defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred
during the quarter ended December 31, 2009, that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

authorized for issuance under LNC’s equity compensation plans.  See
Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II – Item 8 of
this Form 10-K for a brief description of our equity compensation
plans.

(1)

This
      amount excludes outstanding stock options assumed in connection with our
      acquisition of JP as follows:

·

Shares
      of 5,244,423 to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options as of
      December 31, 2009 under the JP Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan with a
      weighted average exercise price of $46.87;
and

·

Shares
      of 410,771 to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options as of
      December 31, 2009 under the JP Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan
      with a weighted average exercise price of
  $43.09.


(2)

This
      amount includes the following:

·

Outstanding
      options of 5,318,621;

·

Outstanding
      long-term incentive awards of 2,819,812, of which 2,166,822 represent
      options with performance conditions and 652,990 represent the number of
      performance shares based on the maximum amounts potentially payable under
      the awards in stock options and shares (including potential dividend
      equivalents).  The long-term incentive awards have not been
      earned as of December 31, 2009.  The number of options and
      shares, if any, to be issued pursuant to such awards will be determined
      based on our, and in some cases, our subsidiaries performance over the
      applicable three-year performance period (target amounts are set forth in
      Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement, included in Part
      II – Item 8 of the Form 10-K for the year end December 31,
      2009.  Since the shares that may be received in payment of the
      awards have no exercise price, they are not included in weighted-average
      exercise price calculation in column (b).  The long-term
      incentive awards are all issued under the LNC 2009 Amended and Restated
      Incentive Compensation Plan
(“ICP”);

      restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units,
