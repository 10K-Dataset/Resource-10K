Lincoln National Corporation




PART I

Item 1.

Business

Business Overview

Lincoln National Corporation (“LNC”) is
a holding company. Through subsidiary companies, LNC operates
multiple insurance and investment management businesses. The
collective group of companies uses “Lincoln Financial
Group” as its marketing identity. Based on assets, LNC is
the 39th largest U.S. Corporation (

2002 Fortune 500, Largest
U.S. Corporations,

April 2002). Based on revenues, LNC is
the 8th largest U.S. stockholder-owned company within the
Fortune 500 Life/ Health Insurance Industry Ranking (

Fortune 500 by Industry Rankings,

April 2002). Operations
are divided into four business segments: 1) Lincoln
Retirement (formerly known as the Annuities segment),
2) Life Insurance, 3) Investment Management and
4) Lincoln UK. Over the past five years, segments have been
redefined as follows. During the first quarter of 2000, changes
to the structure of LNC’s internal organization resulted in
the creation of a separate Annuities segment (now known as the
Lincoln Retirement segment) and a separate Life Insurance
segment. At the end of 2000, LNC established a new wholesaling
distribution organization, Lincoln Financial Distributors
(“LFD”), to focus on the changing business needs of
financial intermediaries. Beginning with the first quarter of
2001, LFD’s results were reported within Other Operations.
Previously, LNC’s wholesaling efforts were conducted
separately within the Lincoln Retirement, Life Insurance and
Investment Management segments. Prior to the fourth quarter of
2001, LNC had a Reinsurance segment. LNC’s reinsurance
operations were acquired by Swiss Re on December 7, 2001
and the related segment information prior to the close of this
transaction was moved to Other Operations.

Revenues, pre-tax income and assets for
LNC’s major business segments and other operations are
shown in this Form 10-K report as part of the consolidated
financial statements (see Note 9 to the consolidated
financial statements). The LNC “Other Operations”
category includes the financial data for operations that are not
directly related to the business segments, unallocated corporate
items (such as, corporate investment income and interest expense
on short-term and long-term borrowings), the operations of
Lincoln Financial Advisors (“LFA”) and LFD, and the
historical results of the former Reinsurance segment along with
the ongoing amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity
reinsurance portion of the transaction with Swiss Re (for
further discussion of the transaction with Swiss Re, refer to
Acquisitions, Divestitures and Discontinued Lines of Business
below).

Although one of the subsidiaries held by LNC was
formed in 1905, LNC itself was formed in 1968. LNC is an Indiana
corporation that maintains its principal offices at 1500 Market
Street, Suite 3900, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102-2112.
As of December 31, 2002, there were 60 persons engaged in
the governance of the LNC holding company. Total employment of
Lincoln National Corporation at December 31, 2002 on a
consolidated basis was 5,830. Of this total, approximately 2,140
employees are included in “Other Operations” related
primarily to the operations of LFA and LFD.

The primary operating subsidiaries that comprise
LNC are Lincoln National Life Insurance Company
(“LNL”); First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Company
(“First Penn”); Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of
New York (“Lincoln Life New York”), Delaware
Management Holdings, Inc. (“Delaware”), Lincoln
National (UK) plc, LFA and LFD.

LNL is an Indiana corporation with its annuities
operations headquartered in Fort Wayne, Indiana and its life
insurance operations headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut. The
primary operations of LNL are reported in the Lincoln Retirement
and Life Insurance segments. LNL also has operations that are
reported in the Investment Management segment and the results of
LNL’s reinsurance operations acquired by Swiss Re via an
indemnity reinsurance transaction are reported in Other
Operations.

First Penn is an Indiana corporation
headquartered in Schaumburg, Illinois. First Penn offers
universal life, term life and deferred fixed annuity products
for distribution in most states of the United States. Through
the end of 2000, all of the operations of First Penn were
reported in the Life Insurance segment. Beginning in



the first quarter of 2001, the reporting of First
Penn’s annuities business was moved from the Life Insurance
segment into the Lincoln Retirement segment.

Lincoln Life New York is a New York company
headquartered in Syracuse, New York. Lincoln Life New York
offers fixed annuities, variable annuities, universal life,
variable universal life, term life and other individual life
insurance products within the state of New York utilizing the
distribution networks described below under Distribution. The
operations of Lincoln Life New York are primarily reported in
the Lincoln Retirement and Life Insurance segments.

Acquisitions, Divestitures and Discontinued
Lines of Business

Over the last several years, LNC has undertaken a
variety of acquisitions and divestitures, and has exited certain
businesses. These actions have been conducted with the goal of
strengthening shareholder value by providing more consistent
sources of earnings and by focusing on financial products that
have the potential for significantly growing earnings. To this
end, the following transactions have occurred during the three
years covered by this Form 10-K:

On August 30, 2002, LNC acquired The
Administrative Management Group, Inc. (“AMG”), an
employee benefits record keeping firm for $21.6 million in
cash. Contingent payments up to an additional $14 million
will be paid over a period of 4 years (2003-2006) if
certain criteria are met. Any such contingent payments will be
expensed as incurred. AMG, a strategic partner of LNC’s
Retirement segment for several years, provides record keeping
services for the Lincoln Alliance Program along with
approximately 400 other clients nationwide. As of
December 31, 2002, the application of purchase accounting
to this acquisition resulted in goodwill of $20.2 million.

On December 7, 2001, Swiss Re acquired
LNC’s reinsurance operation for $2.0 billion. In addition,
LNC retained the capital supporting the reinsurance operation.
After giving effect to the increased levels of capital needed
within the Life Insurance and Lincoln Retirement segments that
result from the change in the ongoing mix of business under
LNC’s internal capital allocation models, the disposition
of LNC’s reinsurance operation freed-up approximately
$100 million of retained capital.

The transaction structure involved a series of
indemnity reinsurance transactions combined with the sale of
certain stock companies that comprised LNC’s reinsurance
operation. At the time of closing, an immediate gain of $15.0
million after-tax was recognized on the sale of the stock
companies. A gain of $723.1 million after-tax
($1.1 billion pre-tax) relating to the indemnity
reinsurance agreements was reported at the time of closing. This
gain was recorded as a deferred gain on LNC’s consolidated
balance sheet, in accordance with the requirements of
FAS 113, and is being amortized into earnings at the rate
that earnings on the reinsured business are expected to emerge,
over a period of 15 years.

On October 29, 2002 LNC and Swiss Re settled
disputed matters totaling about $770 million that had
arisen in connection with the final closing balance sheets
associated with Swiss Re’s acquisition of LNC’s
reinsurance operations. The settlement provided for a payment by
LNC of $195 million to Swiss Re, which was recorded by LNC
as a reduction in deferred gain. As a result of additional
information made available to LNC following the settlement with
Swiss Re in the fourth quarter of 2002, LNC recorded a further
reduction in the deferred gain of $51.6 million after-tax
($79.4 million pre-tax), as well as a $9.4 million
after-tax ($8.3 million pre-tax) reduction in the gain on
the sale of subsidiaries.

As part of the dispute settlement, LNC also paid
$100 million to Swiss Re in satisfaction of LNC’s
$100 million indemnification obligation with respect to
personal accident business. As a result of this payment, LNC has
no further underwriting risk with respect to the reinsurance
business sold. However, because LNC has not been relieved of it
legal liabilities to the underlying ceding companies with
respect to the portion of the business indemnity reinsured by
Swiss Re, under FAS 113 the reserves for the underlying
reinsurance contracts as well as a corresponding reinsurance
recoverable from Swiss Re will continue to be carried on
LNC’s balance sheet during the run-off period of the
underlying reinsurance business. This is particularly relevant
in the case of the exited personal accident and disability
income reinsurance lines of business where the underlying
reserves are based upon various estimates that are subject to
considerable uncertainty.



Also during 2002, LNC exercised a contractual
right to “put” its interest in a subsidiary company
containing LNC’s disability income reinsurance business to
Swiss Re for $10 million. The $10 million sale price
was approximately equal to LNC’s book basis in the
subsidiary.

During 2000, LNC transferred Lincoln UK’s
sales force to Inter-Alliance Group PLC. Concurrent with the
announcement of this transfer, LNC also ceased writing new
business in the United Kingdom (“UK”) through direct
distribution. These actions followed a strategic review of the
Lincoln UK segment in late 1999, where LNC concluded that trends
in the UK insurance market including the unfavorable regulatory
environment raised significant concerns regarding the ongoing
fit of the Lincoln UK segment within LNC’s overall
strategic plans. While these actions have changed the focus of
Lincoln UK’s business to maintaining the in-force policies,
it is not closed to new business and continues to sell some new
products.

Distribution of Products

LNC has an extensive distribution network for the
sale of fixed annuities, variable annuities, universal life
insurance, variable universal life insurance, term life
insurance, other individual insurance coverages, retail mutual
funds, “529” college savings plans, 401(k) products
and managed account products. LNC’s distribution strategy
reflects a marketplace where consumers increasingly want to do
business on their own terms. LNC’s network consists of
internally owned wholesaling and retailing business units: LFD
and LFA, respectively, as well as distribution for annuities
through a third party alliance with American Funds Distributors
(“AFD”). In 2003, LNC and AFD agreed to transition the
wholesaling of the American Legacy Variable Annuity product line
to LFD. For further discussion, see the Lincoln Retirement
Distribution section. LFD, headquartered in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, consists of approximately 250 internal and
external wholesalers organized to penetrate multiple channels
including the Wirehouse/ Regional channel, the Independent
Financial Planner channel, the Marketing General Agent channel
and the Financial Institutions channel. Through its
relationships with a large number of financial intermediaries,
LFD has access to approximately 200,000 financial consultants,
intermediaries and advisors.

LFA is a retail broker/dealer and financial
planning firm that offers a full range of financial and estate
planning services. LFA and its consolidated affiliate, Sagemark,
offer access to annuities, 401(k) plans, pensions, universal and
variable universal life insurance and other wealth accumulation
and protection products and services, and is a preferred
distributor of LNC retail products. LFA and Sagemark are
headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut and consist of nearly
2,100 planners in 39 offices across the United States.

Institutional investment products managed in the
Investment Management segment including large case 401(k) plans
which are marketed by a separate sales force in conjunction with
pension consultants. These products are offered primarily to
defined benefit and defined contribution plan sponsors,
endowments, foundations and insurance companies.

National Branding Campaign

During 2002, Lincoln Financial Group
(“LFG”), the marketing name for LNC and its
affiliates, continued building its brand on a national basis
through an integrated package of national magazine, television
and Internet advertising, sponsorships of major sporting events,
educational partnerships, public relations and promotional
events. In 2002, much of the advertising effort was focused on
an advertising plan designed to secure brand awareness and
familiarity with financial intermediaries, the No. 1 target
audience. Since introducing trade advertising with the
LFD’s “Hero” campaign in March 2001, LFG’s
aided awareness has grown to 91% among intermediaries.
Familiarity also is climbing and reached a high of 72% in 2002.

A new consumer advertising campaign was launched
in July 2002 depicting Abraham Lincoln guiding customers through
dangerous waters and on challenging putting greens. These ads
continue the brand promise of providing

Clear solutions in a
complex world™

. This new campaign was tested in
independent research and was viewed as significantly more
likeable and unique than a base of 818 financial competitor ads.

In June 2002, Lincoln Financial Group announced a
major new partnership with the Philadelphia Eagles football team
to name its new state-of-the-art stadium

Lincoln Financial
Field.

The new facility is nearing completion and is
scheduled to open its gates to the public in August 2003. Based
on evidence from other



major markets and sports teams, stadium
entitlements are a proven way to build strong brand awareness.
The announcement has already resulted in significant new
visibility for the Lincoln Financial Group brand nationwide.

Description of Business Segments

1.     Lincoln
Retirement

The Lincoln Retirement segment (formerly the
Annuities segment), headquartered in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with
additional operations in Portland, Maine and the Chicago,
Illinois metro area, provides tax-deferred investment growth and
lifetime income opportunities for its clients through the
manufacture and sale of fixed and variable annuities. There are
two lines of business within this segment, individual annuities
and employer-sponsored markets. Both lines of business offer
fixed annuity and variable annuity products.

The individual annuities line of business markets
non-qualified and qualified fixed and variable annuities to
individuals. Annuities are attractive, because they provide
tax-deferred growth in the underlying principal, thereby
deferring the tax consequences of the growth in value until
withdrawals are made from the accumulation values, often at
lower tax rates occurring during retirement. In addition to
favorable tax treatment, annuities are unique in that retirees
can select a variety of payout alternatives to help provide an
income flow during life. The individual annuities market is a
growth market that has seen an increase in competition along
with new product types and promotion.

The employer-sponsored retirement line of
business markets fixed and variable annuities along with a
turnkey retirement program (investments, record-keeping,
employee education and compliance) to targeted markets. The key
segments of the employer-sponsored retirement markets are:
healthcare, public/governmental, education, corporate and
not-for-profit. Within these segments, LNC targets those markets
that offer the most favorable demographics, distribution
synergies and current and potential market share.

Products

In general, an annuity is a contract between an
insurance company and an individual or group in which the
insurance company, after receipt of one or more contributions,
agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on a
periodic basis (i.e., annually, semi-annually, quarterly or
monthly), beginning on a certain date and continuing for a
period of time as specified in the contract. Such payments can
begin the month after the deposit is received (referred to as an
immediate annuity) or at a future date in time (referred to as a
deferred annuity). This retirement vehicle helps protect an
individual from outliving his money and can be either a fixed
annuity or a variable annuity.

Fixed Annuity:

A
fixed deferred annuity preserves the principal value of the
contract while guaranteeing a minimum interest rate to be
credited to the accumulation value. LNC offers both single and
flexible premium fixed deferred annuities to the individual
annuities market. Single premium fixed deferred annuities are
contracts that allow only a single contribution to be made.
Flexible premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that
allow multiple contributions on either a scheduled or
non-scheduled basis. With fixed deferred annuities, the
contractholder has the right to surrender the contract and
receive the current accumulation value less any applicable
surrender charge and, if applicable, market value adjustment.
Also, certain fixed annuity products, such as the popular Step
Five Fixed Annuity, allow for a window period between the end of
the fixed guarantee period and the start of the subsequent
guarantee period during which the account holder can withdraw
their funds without incurring a surrender charge. Fixed annuity
contributions are invested in LNC’s general account. LNC
bears the investment risk for fixed annuity contracts. To
protect itself from premature withdrawals, LNC imposes surrender
charges. Surrender charges are typically applicable during the
early years of the annuity contract, with a declining level of
surrender charges over time. LNC expects to earn a spread
between what it earns on the underlying general account
investments supporting the fixed annuity product line and what
it credits to its fixed annuity contractholders’ accounts.



Throughout 2001 and 2002, even with the
historically low interest rate environment, fixed annuities have
taken on increased importance due to the sustained volatility of
the equity markets that began in the second quarter of 2000. LNC
primarily distributes fixed annuities through the Financial
Institutions channel and to a lesser extent in the Independent
Financial Planner and Wirehouse/ Regional channels. LNC’s
fixed annuity sales in 2001 through 2002 were bolstered by
product offerings that were introduced in 2001 including the
Lincoln Select and ChoicePlus Fixed Annuities and the
StepFive® Fixed Annuity.

The guarantees of the StepFive Fixed Annuity have
been especially well-received in the Financial Institutions
channel. New product offerings launched in 2002 in the Financial
Institutions channel included the AccelaRate and
ChoiceGuarantee® Fixed Annuities. The market value adjusted
(“MVA”) feature of the Lincoln Select and ChoicePlus
Fixed Annuities is expected to be more attractive in the
Wirehouse/ Regional channel during a volatile interest rate
environment. This feature increases or decreases the cash
surrender value of the annuity based on a decrease or increase
in interest rates. Contractholders participate in gains when the
contract is surrendered in a falling interest rate market, and
LNC is protected from losses up to a cap when the contract is
surrendered in a rising interest rate market. A new version of
Lincoln Select that provides the individual with a higher
interest rate but a larger potential penalty for early
withdrawal or surrender is being considered.

Variable Annuity:

A
variable annuity provides the contractholder the ability to
direct the investment of deposits into one or more sub-accounts
offered by the product. The value of the contractholder’s
account varies with the performance of the underlying
sub-accounts chosen by the contractholder. The underlying assets
of the sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance
series of mutual funds. Because the contractholder’s return
is tied to the performance of the segregated assets underlying
the variable annuity, the contractholder bears the investment
risk associated with these investments. LNC charges the
contractholder insurance and administrative fees based upon the
value of the variable contract.

The separate account choices for LNC’s
variable annuities cover diverse asset classes with varying
levels of risk and include both equity funds and fixed income
funds. The Individual and Group Multi-Fund® Variable
Annuity product line offers 36 fund choices from 13 well known

the 3rd largest mutual fund company for 2002 based on assets
under management. LNC’s Alliance Program, which is for the
employer-sponsored market, has over 2000 mutual fund choices
plus a fixed account. This product is customized for each
employer.

Most of LNC’s variable annuity products also
offer the choice of a fixed option that provides for guaranteed
interest credited to the account value. In addition, many of
LNC’s individual variable annuities feature minimum
guaranteed death benefits. These minimum guaranteed death
benefits include either guaranteed return of premium, the
highest account value attained on any policy anniversary through
attained age 80 (i.e., high water mark), or a 5% annual
step up (i.e., roll-up) of the account value depending on
the specific terms of the contract.

LNC earns mortality assessments and expense
assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and
administrative charges. These expenses are built into
accumulation unit values, which when multiplied by the number of
units owned for any sub-account equals the contractholder’s
account value for that sub-account. Some products feature
decreasing fee schedules based on account value break points.
The fees that LNC earns from these policies are classified as
insurance fees on the income statement. In addition, for some
contracts, LNC collects surrender charges when contractholders
surrender their contracts during the early years of a contract.
For other contracts, LNC collects surrender charges when
contractholders surrender



their contracts during a number of years
subsequent to each deposit. LNC’s individual variable
annuity products have a maximum surrender period of ten years.
The assets that support variable annuities are included in the
assets held in separate accounts balance and the related
liabilities for the current account values are included in the
liabilities related to separate accounts balance.

In 2002, LNC continued to grow variable annuity
incremental deposits (i.e., gross deposits reduced by
transfers from other Lincoln Retirement products). These sales
were the result of the product momentum which started in the
year 2000 when LNC introduced more new variable annuity products
than it did in the preceding five years and continued through
2002. In 2002, a new low cost variable annuity product,
Multi-Fund 5 was launched. In addition, the ChoicePlus and
American Legacy product offerings in New York were expanded to
include bonus, L-share and A-share (American Legacy only)
contracts. LNC now offers through most of its variable annuity
product lines, A-share, B-share, C-share, L-share and bonus
variable annuities. The differences in A, B, C and L-shares
relate to the sales charge and fee structure associated with the
contract. An A-share has a front-end sales charge. A B-share has
a contingent deferred sales charge that is only paid if the
account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of
contractual free withdrawals within the contract’s
specified surrender charge period. A C-share has no front-end
sales charge or back-end surrender charge. Like a B-share, an
L-share has a contingent deferred sales charge that is only paid
if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of
contractual free withdrawals within the contract’s
specified surrender charge period. The differences between the
L-share and B-share are the length of the surrender charge
period and the fee structure. L-shares have a shorter surrender
charge period, so for the added liquidity, mortality and expense
assessments are higher.

A bonus annuity is a variable annuity contract,
which offers a bonus credit to a contract based on a specified
percentage (typically ranging from 2% to 5%) of each deposit.
Bonus products, in general have come under increased scrutiny
due to concerns with whether they have been properly designed
and sold with the contractholders’ interests in mind. The
concern is that the higher expenses and extended surrender
charge periods that are often associated with bonus annuities
may not be adequately understood by contractholders. In
developing bonus annuity products for its Lincoln ChoicePlus and
American Legacy variable annuities, LNC has attempted to address
these concerns, while at the same time designing products that
are competitive in the marketplace. A key competitive feature of
LNC’s bonus annuity that is attractive to long-term
contractholders is the persistency credit. This feature rewards
a contractholder with a bonus credit of 20 basis points per
annum after maintaining an account for 14 years. In
addition, a 30 basis point per annum persistency credit is
offered on LNC’s L-share products after a contractholder
maintains an account for eight years.

LNC offers other innovative product features
including the Income4Life® Solution, Income4Life Advantage
and when sold in conjunction with Income4Life, the Accumulated
Benefit Enhancement (“ABE”) rider. The Income4Life
Solution and Income4Life Advantage features allow variable
annuity contractholders access and control during the income
distribution phase of their contract. This added flexibility
allows the contractholder to access the account value for
transfers, additional withdrawals and other service features
like portfolio rebalancing. The ABE rider which was first
introduced in 2002 lets clients transfer their balances to LNC
variable annuity products and retain the death benefit of their
prior variable annuity. Unlike bonus products, which require
longer surrender penalties and increased mortality and expense
assessments, this rider is available only in conjunction with
Income4Life on all share classes of most LNC variable annuity
product lines with no additional charge.

According to

Variable Annuity Research and
Data Services (“VARDS”)

, LNC’s American
Legacy III Variable Annuity ranked number 3 out of 122 variable
annuities for asset-weighted performance for the five-year
period ended December 31, 2002. The American Legacy I
Variable Annuity ranked number 1 on this basis. Challenging
equity markets like those experienced in 2001 and 2002 may
prompt contactholders of competitors’ variable annuities to
consider better-performing LNC variable annuities.

Looking forward, so-called living benefits that
provide equity market performance guarantees, are becoming more
prevalent in the industry. LNC is looking at various product
approaches and designs in this



area that will provide a competitive benefit
while still falling within its risk tolerance levels for such
guarantees.

Distribution

Fixed annuity products as well as most individual
variable annuity product lines are distributed by LFD. Recently,
LNC and American Funds Distributors (“AFD”) have
agreed to transition the wholesaling of the American Legacy
Variable Annuity product line to LFD. Currently, AFD uses
wholesalers who focus on both American Funds mutual funds, as
well as the American Legacy Variable Annuity products. Segment
management believes that the change to a dedicated team focused
on key broker/dealer relationships developed in conjunction with
AFD, should lead to renewed growth in American Legacy Variable
Annuity sales. Lincoln Financial Advisors (“LFA”),
LNC’s retail broker/dealer and financial planning firm, as
a client of AFD and LFD, sells the American Legacy Variable
Annuity and the ChoicePlus Variable Annuity. LFA also sells
LNC’s MultiFund Variable Annuity product line in both the
individual and employer-sponsored retirement markets and the
Alliance Program in the employer-sponsored retirement market.
Group fixed and variable annuity products are also distributed
through the Lincoln Retirement Fringe Benefit Division’s
dedicated sales force to the employer-sponsored retirement
market.

Market
Position

Capitalizing on a broad product portfolio and a
strong and diverse distribution network, LNC is a leader in both
the individual and employer-sponsored annuity markets. According
to VARDS, LNC ranks 4th in assets as of December 31, 2002
and 10th in variable annuity sales for the year ended
December 31, 2002 in the United States. LNC ranked 10th in
fixed annuity sales through financial institutions for 2002
(

Kenneth Kehrer Associates Fixed Annuity Sales Through
Financial Institutions Rankings for 2002

).

LNC was an early entrant into the fixed and
variable annuity business and as such has a mature book of
business with many contracts that are out of the surrender
charge period. As a result, LNC, as well as other seasoned
industry participants, have been vulnerable to what are referred
to as Section 1035 exchanges, named after the Internal
Revenue Code Section that governs these exchanges. In 1035
exchanges, contractholders surrender their annuity and make a
non-taxable transfer to another insurance company’s
non-qualified annuity. Over the last three years LNC’s
lapse rate went from approximately 12% in 2000 to 9.7% in 2001
and back up to 10.5% in 2002, which was better than pricing in
all three years. LNC’s strong persistency and new sales
growth have contributed to the maintenance of overall positive
net flows throughout 2002. LNC first achieved overall positive
net flows in the third quarter of 2001 after over three years of
net outflows. Over the last few years, a contributing factor to
the strong persistency experienced by LNC’s variable
annuities has been the weak equity markets. Contractholders
whose variable annuity contracts have guaranteed minimum death
benefits that are in the money due to equity market declines are
less likely to transfer from these contracts. In the future,
however, given the ongoing volatility of the equity markets,
living benefit guarantees offered by some competitors may
provide contractholders with an inducement to do a 1035 exchange.

Approximately 1,420 employees are involved in
this business segment.

2.     Life
Insurance

The Life Insurance segment, headquartered in
Hartford, Connecticut, focuses on the creation and protection of
wealth for its clients through the manufacture and sale of life
insurance products. The Life Insurance segment offers both
single and survivorship versions of universal life
(“UL”), variable universal life (“VUL”), and
interest-sensitive whole life (“ISWL”), as well as
corporate owned life insurance (“COLI”) and term
insurance. The segment also offers a linked-benefit product
which is a universal life insurance policy linked with an
accelerated benefits rider that provides a benefit for long-term
care needs. This operation targets the affluent market, defined
as households with at least $500,000 of investable net worth.
Two key measures of the effectiveness of meeting the needs of
this market include average face amount of policies sold, which
was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
and average premiums paid per policy sold, which were
approximately $28,000 for the same period.



Products

The Life Insurance segment’s book of
business includes interest/market-sensitive products (UL, VUL,
ISWL, COLI) and traditional life products (term and guaranteed
cost whole life). Profitability is driven by mortality margins
(defined below), investment margins (spreads/fees), expenses and
surrender fees.

Mortality margins represent the difference
between amounts charged the customer to cover the mortality risk
and the cost of reinsurance and death benefits paid. Mortality
charges are either specifically deducted from the
contractholder’s fund (i.e. cost of insurance assessments
or “COIs”) or embedded in the premiums charged to the
customer. In either case, these amounts are a function of the
rates priced into the product and level of insurance in-force
(less reserves previously set aside to fund benefits). Insurance
in-force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality
experience.

Similar to the annuity product classifications
described above, life products can be classified as
“fixed” and “variable” contracts. This
classification describes whether the policyholder or LNC bears
the investment risk of the assets supporting the policy. This
also determines the manner in which LNC earns investment margin
profits from these products, either as investment spreads for
fixed products or as fees charged for variable products.

Fixed Life Insurance (primarily UL and ISWL):

Premiums net of expense loads and
charges received on fixed products are invested in LNC’s
general account investment portfolio, so LNC bears the risk on
investment performance. LNC manages investment margins, (i.e.
the difference between the rate the portfolio earns compared to
the rate that is credited to the customer) by seeking to
maximize current yields, in line with asset/liability and risk
management targets, while crediting a competitive rate to the
customer. Crediting rates are typically subject to guaranteed
minimums specified in the underlying life insurance contract.

Variable Universal Life Insurance (VUL):

Premiums net of expense loads and
charges received on VUL products are invested in separate
accounts which offer several investment options for the
customer’s selection. The investment choices are the same,
in most cases, as the investment choices offered in LNC’s
variable annuity contracts. In addition, VUL products offer a
fixed account option which is managed by LNC. Investment risk is
borne by the customer on all but the fixed account option. LNC
charges fees for mortality costs and administrative expenses, as
well as investment management fees.

Corporate Owned Life Insurance
(“COLI”):

COLI is typically
purchased by corporations funding non-qualified benefit plans.
These include 401(k) excess — voluntary deferrals of
executive salary and/or bonus in excess of 401(k) limits and
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERP’s) in a
variety of forms, paid for with corporate funds. LNC offers a
portfolio of both fixed UL and variable UL COLI products sold
primarily through specialty brokers.

Term Life Insurance:

Term life insurance provides a death
benefit without a cash accumulation balance. Policy premiums are
generally paid annually.

Distribution

Distribution of the Life Insurance segment’s
products occurs primarily through LNC’s internally owned
wholesaling arm, LFD, and its retail sales arm, LFA. Both
channels have an industry-wide reputation of being highly
skilled in the development of financial and estate planning
solutions for the affluent market. During August of 2002, the
Life Insurance segment entered into a marketing agreement with
M Group Financial (“M Group”) to sell
LNC’s life insurance products. LNC became one of five core
carriers providing life insurance and annuity products to the
member firms of M Group. M Group is the largest
Independent Producer Group in the nation. It is represented by
over 100 firms. M Group firm members provide an opportunity
to further broaden the distribution of LNC’s products to
the affluent market.



Market
Position

LNC is a leading provider of life insurance
products designed specifically for the high net-worth and
affluent markets. Product breadth, design innovation,
competitiveness and speed to market all contribute to the
strength of LNC’s life insurance operations. Averaging
close to 10 major product upgrades and/or new features per year
since 1998, including 14 significant VUL, UL, Term and COLI
product enhancements and new riders in 2002, the Life Insurance
segment is successful at meeting changing needs when market
trends shift.

LNC’s current market leadership position is
a result of the breadth and quality of its product portfolio
along with its commitment to exceptional customer service, its
extensive distribution network and the growth opportunity
offered by its target market, the affluent.

Approximately 790 employees are involved in this
business segment.

3.     Investment
Management

The Investment Management segment, which is
headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with offices in Fort
Wayne, London, and Denver, provides investment products and
services to both individual and institutional investors. The
primary companies within this business segment include Lincoln
National Investments, Inc. (“LNI”), Lincoln National
Investment Companies, Inc. (“LNIC”), and Delaware
Management Holdings, Inc. (“Delaware”). LNI and LNIC
are intermediate level holding companies that own the operating
companies within this segment. The Investment Management segment
also includes the 401(k) operations of LNL. The operating
subsidiaries within Delaware offer a broad line of mutual funds,
retirement plan services and other investment products including
managed accounts, and “529” college savings plans to
retail investors and also offer investment advisory services and
products to institutional clients, which primarily include
pension funds, foundations, endowment funds and trusts. Delaware
currently serves as investment advisor to approximately 275
institutional accounts; acts as investment manager and/or
shareholder services agent for approximately 100 open-end funds;
and serves as investment manager for 10 closed-end funds. The
Investment Management segment also provides investment advisory
services for LNC’s corporate portfolios.

Products

The Investment Management segment provides an
array of products for a range of investors. Products include
domestic and international equity and fixed-income retail mutual
funds, separate accounts, institutional mutual funds, managed
accounts, “529” college savings plans, and retirement
plans and services as well as administration services for these
products.

For the individual investor, Delaware offers
various products including mutual funds and managed accounts.
Delaware also provides investment management and account
administration services for variable annuity products. Delaware
offers alternative pricing schemes for mutual funds including
traditional front-end load funds, back-end load funds, and
level-load funds. Variable annuity products provide the
contractholder the ability to direct the investment of deposits
into one or more funds offered by the product. The Institutional
Class shares of the mutual funds are also available to
institutional clients and retirement plan participants (such as
defined contribution plans). Delaware also provides investment
services to high net worth and small institutional investor
markets through managed accounts. A managed account is provided
to individual investors through relationships with broker-dealer
sponsored programs.

Delaware offers various retirement plans and
services, including 401(k) plans. A 401(k) plan allows employees
to divert a portion of their salary to a company-sponsored
tax-sheltered account, thus deferring taxes until retirement.
These plans generally offer several investment options such as
equity and fixed income products. In 2002, Delaware entered the
“529” college savings plan market with the roll out of
“529” programs for the state of Hawaii and the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The persistence of poor equity
markets, combined with a more crowded “529”
marketplace, resulted in lower than anticipated sales in 2002.



These programs, however, provide Delaware with an
opportunity to attract significant long-term assets under
management.

Delaware provides a broad range of institutional
investment advisory services to corporate and public retirement
plans, endowments and foundations, nuclear decommissioning
trusts, socially responsible investors, sub-advisory clients and
Taft-Hartley plans, among others. Most clients utilize
individually managed separate accounts, which means clients have
the opportunity to customize the management of their portfolio
by including or excluding certain types of securities, sectors
or segments within a given asset class. Because of their
individually managed nature, these separate accounts are best
suited for larger investment mandates. Currently,
Delaware’s minimum account size is typically
$10 million for U.S. investments and $100 million for
non-U.S. investments.

The funds included in the Delaware Pooled Trust
product offering are no-load mutual funds designed for the
institutional investor and high net worth individual. Delaware
Pooled Trust is a series of SEC registered mutual funds managed
in styles that are similar to institutional separate account
offerings and best suited for smaller to medium-sized
institutional investment mandates. Delaware’s minimum
account size for these vehicles is typically $1 million.

Market
Position

Diversity of investment styles, as well as
diversity of clients served are prudent ways to diversify risk
in varying market environments. Delaware, historically known
primarily for a conservative, “value” equity
investment style, has evolved over the last few years into an
investment manager with strong and diversified offerings across
multiple asset classes including value and growth equity
investment styles; high-grade, high-yield and municipal
fixed-income investment styles; balanced and quantitative
investment styles; and international and global equity and fixed
income investment styles. Delaware’s investment
performance, which began to improve in 2000 with the
implementation of various targeted initiatives, has been strong
over the last two years. Positive investment performance has
been the key driver of the overall positive net flows that have
been achieved throughout 2002. The segment experienced positive
net flows of $2.9 billion in 2002, an improvement of
$3.5 billion from the prior year. The key contributors to
this improvement were higher retail and institutional sales and
improved retention of institutional assets, primarily in
response to the improved investment performance relative to
peers. Overall retail sales increased $2.0 billion and
institutional inflows increased $1.4 billion. In addition,
retail equity sales increased $1.7 billion in what was a
difficult sales environment given the further weakening of the
equity markets in 2002. The retail sales growth was primarily
attributable to increased sales of managed accounts. A portion
of these sales was bolstered by external events affecting key
competitors. While the Investment Management segment has made
measurable progress on the initiatives of investment
performance, sales growth and institutional asset retention, its
focus in 2003 is not only to sustain and improve upon those
results, but also to improve overall profitability.

Distribution

The businesses in the Investment Management
segment deliver their broad range of products through multiple
distribution channels, enabling them to reach an expanding
community of retail and institutional investors. Delaware
distributes retail mutual funds, managed accounts,
“529” college savings plans and retirement products
through the LFD distribution network, LFA, and Delaware’s
direct retirement sales force. Institutional products are
marketed primarily by Delaware’s institutional marketing
group working closely with manager selection consultants. These
products are also offered primarily to defined benefit and
defined contribution plan sponsors, endowments, foundations and
insurance companies.

Approximately 1,270 employees are involved in
this business segment.

4.     Lincoln UK

Lincoln UK is headquartered in Barnwood,
Gloucester, England, and is licensed to do business throughout
the United Kingdom (“UK”). Although Lincoln UK
transferred its sales force to Inter-Alliance Group PLC in the
third quarter of 2000, it continues to manage, administer and
accept new deposits on its



current block of business and, accept new
business for certain products. Lincoln UK’s product
portfolio principally consists of unit-linked life and pension
products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and
annuity products.

In the third quarter of 2002, Lincoln UK
agreed to outsource its customer service and policy
administration function to the Capita Group, plc
(“Capita”). The agreement involved the transfer of
approximately 500 employees to Capita. The number of employees
noted below reflects the actual level of staffing for the
current business structure.

Approximately 210 employees are involved in this
business segment.

Other Matters

1.     Regulatory

LNC’s Retirement, Life Insurance and
Lincoln UK business segments, in common with those of other
insurance companies, are subject to regulation and supervision
by the states, territories and countries in which they are
licensed to do business. The laws of these jurisdictions
generally establish supervisory agencies with broad
administrative powers relative to granting and revoking licenses
to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing
agents, prescribing and approving policy forms, regulating
premium rates for some lines of business, establishing reserve
requirements, regulating competitive matters, prescribing the
form and content of financial statements and reports, regulating
the type and amount of investments permitted and prescribing
minimum levels of capital. The ability to continue an insurance
business is dependent upon the maintenance of the licenses in
the various jurisdictions. In addition, variable annuities and
variable life insurance businesses and products are subject to
regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) and the National Association of
Securities Dealers (“NASD”).

LNC’s Investment Management segment, in
common with other investment management groups, is subject to
regulation and supervision by the SEC, NASD, Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”), Financial
Services Authority (“FSA”) in London, the Pennsylvania
Department of Banking and jurisdictions of the states,
territories and foreign countries in which they are licensed to
do business.

LFA is subject to regulation and supervision by
the SEC and NASD on broker dealer and registered investment
advisor issues.

2.     Miscellaneous

LNC’s insurance subsidiaries protect
themselves against losses greater than the amount they are
willing to retain on any one risk or event by purchasing
reinsurance from unaffiliated insurance companies (see
Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).

All businesses LNC is involved in are highly
competitive due to the market structure and the large number of
competitors. At the end of 2001, the latest year for which data
is available, there were approximately 1,225 life insurance
companies in the United States. As noted previously, based on
revenues, LNC is the 8th largest U.S. stockholder-owned company
within the Fortune 500 Life/ Health Insurance industry ranking
(

2002 Fortune 500 by Industry Rankings,

April 2002).
LNC’s investment management companies were the 51st largest
U.S. investment management group at the end of 2001

(2001
Institutional Investor 300 Money Managers,

July 2002). Also,
many of the products offered by LNC’s operating companies
are similar to products offered by non-insurance financial
services companies, such as banks. The Financial Services
Modernization Act was passed in November 1999 and repealed the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and expands the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956. This act allows, among other things,
cross-ownership by banks, securities firms and insurance
companies. In 2002, there were some cross-ownership activities
in the financial services industry; however, there was minimal
impact on LNC’s operations.

Because of the nature of the insurance and
investment management businesses, there is no single customer or
group of customers upon whom the business is dependent. Although
LNC does not have any significant concentration of customers,
LNC’s Retirement segment has a long-standing distribution
relation-



ship with American Funds Distributors
(“AFD”) that is significant to this segment. In 2002,
the American Legacy Variable Annuity product line sold through
AFD accounted for about 15% of LNC’s total gross annuity
deposits. In addition, the American Legacy Variable Annuity
product line represents approximately 31% of LNC’s total
gross annuity account values at December 31, 2002.
Recently, LNC and AFD have agreed to transition the wholesaling
of American Legacy to LFD. Currently, AFD uses wholesalers who
focus on both American Funds mutual funds as well as the
American Legacy Variable Annuity products. Segment management
believes that this change to a dedicated team focused on key
broker/dealer relationships developed in conjunction with AFD
should renew growth in American Legacy Variable Annuity sales.

LNC does not have a separate unit that conducts
market research. Research activities related to new products or
services, or the improvement of existing products or services,
are conducted within the business segments. Expenses related to
such activities are not material. Also, sales are not dependent
upon select geographic areas. LNC has foreign operations that
are significant in relationship to the consolidated group (see
Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).

3.     Available
Information

LNC files annual, quarterly and current reports,
proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The public
may read and copy any materials that LNC files with the SEC at
the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street,
NW, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information
on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC
at 1-800-SEC-0330. Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website
that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and
other information regarding issuers, including LNC, that file
electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents
that LNC files with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.

LNC also makes available free of charge on or
through its Internet website (http://www.lfg.com) LNC’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments
to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as
reasonably practicable after LNC electronically files such
material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

Item 2.

Properties

LNC and the various operating businesses own or
lease approximately 2.9 million square feet of office
space. The governance group for LNC and the Investment
Management segment lease 0.4 million square feet of office
space in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The operating units in the
Fort Wayne, Indiana area own or lease 1.0 million square
feet. Also, businesses operating in the Chicago, Illinois metro
area; Hartford, Connecticut and the United Kingdom own or lease
another 0.6 million square feet of office space. An
additional 0.9 million square feet of office space is owned
or leased in other U.S. cities and foreign countries for branch
offices and other operations. As shown in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements (see Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements), the rental expense on
operating leases for office space and equipment totaled
$67.0 million for 2002. Office space rent expense accounts
for $56.6 million of this total. This discussion regarding
properties does not include information on investment properties.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

LNC and its subsidiaries are involved in various
pending or threatened legal proceedings, including purported
class actions, arising from the conduct of business. In some
instances, these proceedings include claims for unspecified or
substantial punitive damages and similar types of relief in
addition to amounts for alleged contractual liability or
requests for equitable relief. After consultation with legal
counsel and a review of available facts, it is management’s
opinion that these proceedings ultimately will be resolved
without materially affecting the consolidated financial position
of LNC. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements).

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results and Financial
Condition

Introduction

Lincoln National Corporation (“LNC”) is
a holding company. Through subsidiary companies, LNC operates
multiple insurance and investment management businesses. The
collective group of companies uses, “Lincoln Financial
Group” as its marketing identity. LNC is the 39th largest
(based on assets) United States Corporation (

2001 Fortune
500, Largest U.S. Corporations, April 2002

). Operations are
divided into four business segments: 1) Lincoln Retirement
(formerly known as the Annuities segment), 2) Life
Insurance, 3) Investment Management and 4) Lincoln UK.
LNC reports operations not directly related to the business
segments and unallocated corporate items (i.e., corporate
investment income, interest expense on corporate debt,
unallocated overhead expenses, and the operations of Lincoln
Financial Advisors (“LFA”) and Lincoln Financial
Distributors (“LFD”) and the amortization of the
deferred gain on the sale of Lincoln Re) in “Other
Operations”. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2001, LNC had a
Reinsurance segment. Total employment of LNC at
December 31, 2002 on a consolidated basis was 5,830.

Forward-Looking Statements —
Cautionary Language

The pages that follow review results of
operations of LNC Consolidated, LNC’s four business
segments and “Other Operations”; LNC’s
consolidated investments; and consolidated financial condition
including liquidity, cash flows and capital resources.
Historical financial information is presented and analyzed.
Where appropriate, factors that may affect future financial
performance are identified and discussed. Certain statements
made in this report are “forward-looking statements”
within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include,
without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast,
indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements,
and may contain words like: “believe”,
“anticipate”, “expect”,
“estimate”, “project”, “will”,
“shall” and other words or phrases with similar
meaning.

Forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially
from the results contained in the forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, among others, subsequent
significant changes in: the Company (e.g., acquisitions and
divestitures of legal



entities and blocks of business —
directly or by means of reinsurance transactions); financial
markets (e.g., interest rates and securities markets);
competitors and competing products and services; LNC’s
ability to operate its businesses in a relatively normal manner;
legislation (

e.g

., corporate, individual, estate and
product taxation); the price of LNC’s stock; accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States; regulations
(e.g., insurance and securities regulations); and debt and
claims-paying ratings issued by nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations.

Other risks and uncertainties include: the risk
that significant accounting, fraud or corporate governance
issues may adversely affect the value of certain investments;
whether necessary regulatory approvals are obtained
(e.g., insurance department, Hart-Scott-Rodino, etc.) and,
if obtained, whether they are obtained on a timely basis;
whether proceeds from divestitures of legal entities and blocks
of business can be used as planned; litigation, arbitration and
other actions (e.g., (a) adverse decisions in
significant actions including, but not limited to extra
contractual and class action damage cases, (b) new
decisions which change the law, (c) unexpected trial court
rulings, (d) unavailability of witnesses and (e) newly
discovered evidence); acts of God (e.g., hurricanes,
earthquakes and storms); whether there will be any significant
charges or benefits resulting from the contingencies described
in the footnotes to LNC’s consolidated financial
statements; acts of terrorism or war; the stability of
governments in countries in which LNC’s subsidiaries do
business; and other insurance risks (e.g., policyholder
mortality and morbidity).

The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other
sections of this report, and LNC’s quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
include additional factors which could impact LNC’s
business and financial performance. Moreover, LNC operates in a
rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors
emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management
to predict all such risk factors. Further, it is not possible to
assess the impact of all risk factors on LNC’s business or
the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained
in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and
uncertainties, investors should not place undo reliance on
forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In
addition, LNC disclaims any obligation to update any
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
that occur after the date of this report.

Critical Accounting Policies

Given the nature of LNC’s business, the
Company’s accounting policies require the use of judgments
relating to a variety of assumptions and estimates. Because of
the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions and estimates
underlying these accounting policies, under different conditions
or assumptions the amounts reported in LNC’s financial
statements could be materially different. Throughout
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the application of
these various critical accounting policies is addressed along
with the effect of changes in estimates and assumptions.

To provide an overall perspective on these
critical accounting policies, and guidance as to the specific
areas within Management’s Discussion and Analysis where
these critical accounting policies are discussed in detail, a
summary of critical accounting policies and the disclosure
location is presented below.

Accounting for intangible assets requires
numerous assumptions, such as estimates of expected future
profitability for various LNC operations and LNC’s ability
to retain its existing blocks of life and annuity business in
force. LNC’s accounting policies for the intangible assets
of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and the present
value of acquired blocks of in-force policies (“PVIF”)
are discussed within the Lincoln Retirement, Life Insurance and
Lincoln UK segments. LNC’s overall accounting policy for
other identified intangibles and goodwill is discussed within
Results of Consolidated Operations. A key assumption affecting
the accounting for DAC and PVIF is the performance of equity
markets. Sensitivity to changes in equity market performance
upon LNC’s net income is discussed under the heading
“First Quarter 2003 Guidance for the Effects of Equity
Market Volatility on Fee Income, DAC and GMDB” found within
LNC’s discussion of Consolidated Operating results.
Additionally, LNC has goodwill resulting from various
acquisitions. Refer to the “Accounting for Business
Combinations and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
section for discussion of the evaluation of goodwill for
impairment. Within the Investment Management segment, LNC has an



intangible asset for Deferred Dealer Commissions.
A significant decrease in the equity markets could affect the
carrying value of this asset. Refer to the Investment Management
Results of Operations section for future discussion of this
asset.

Determining whether a decline in current fair
values for invested assets is other than a temporary decline in
value can frequently involve a variety of assumptions and
estimates, particularly for investments that are not actively
traded on established markets. For instance, assessing the value
of some investments requires an analysis of expected future cash
flows. Some investment structures, such as collateralized debt
obligations, often represent selected levels, or tranches of
underlying investments in a wide variety of underlying issuers.
LNC’s accounting policies for its invested assets are
discussed within Results of Consolidated Operations and
Consolidated Investments. Specific discussion of LNC’s
accounting policy for write-downs for securities that were
determined to have declines in fair value that were other than
temporary along with analysis of securities available-for-sale
in an unrealized loss position can be found within Consolidated
Investments.

To protect itself from a variety of equity market
and interest rate risks that are inherent in many of LNC’s
life insurance and annuity products, LNC uses various derivative
instruments. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging
programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related
derivatives often involves a variety of assumptions and
estimates. LNC’s accounting policies for derivatives are
discussed within Results of Consolidated Operations,
Consolidated Investments and within the discussion of
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In
addition, discussion of the potential impact on interest rate
risk in a falling rate environment is included in the
“Interest Rate Risk — Falling Rates” section
within LNC’s discussion of Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.

Establishing adequate liabilities for LNC’s
obligations to its policyholders requires assumptions to be made
regarding mortality and morbidity. The effect of variances in
these assumptions is discussed within the Lincoln Retirement and
Life Insurance segments. In addition, refer to the discussion of
personal accident and disability income reserves included within
the Acquisition and Divestiture discussion of the disposition of
LNC’s former Reinsurance segment within Other Operations.
As discussed within the Lincoln Retirement segment, one of the
liabilities is the reserve for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits
(“GMDB”). A key assumption affecting the accounting
for GMDB is the performance of equity markets. Sensitivity to
changes in equity market performance upon GMDB and LNC’s
net income is discussed under the heading “First Quarter
2003 Guidance for the Effects of Equity Market Volatility”
found within LNC’s discussion of Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Pursuant to the accounting rules for LNC’s
obligations to employees under its various retirement and
welfare benefit plans, LNC is required to make a large number of
assumptions, such as the future performance of financial markets
and the composition of LNC’s employee workforce in the
future. LNC’s accounting for its employee plans is
discussed in detail within Note 6 Employee Benefit Plans, which
is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Establishing reserves for litigation and
compliance-related regulatory actions inherently involve a
variety of estimates of potential future outcomes. These matters
are discussed within Results of Consolidated Operations and in
the Lincoln UK segment, with additional detail provided within
Note 7 Restrictions, Commitments and Contingencies, which
is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

As LNC responds to an ever-changing business
environment and continues to adapt its organizational and
operational structures, the frequency of necessary restructuring
activities increases. Establishing reserves for the expected
costs of these restructurings requires a variety of estimates
and assumptions. The accounting for LNC’s restructurings is
discussed within Results of Consolidated Operations and within
Results of Operations for each affected business segment, as
well as within Note 12 Restructuring Charges included in the
notes to consolidated financial statements.

Continued access to capital markets and
maintenance of favorable debt and claims paying ratings are
critical to LNC’s future success. LNC’s accounting, in
a wide variety of areas, is inherently dependant upon continued
access to capital and maintaining adequate ratings. Detailed
discussion of LNC’s access to capital markets, liquidity
status and ratings are contained within Review of Consolidated
Financial Condition.



Finally, it is LNC’s policy to provide
disclosure of commitments or guarantees so that its financial
statements present as complete a picture of LNC’s financial
condition as possible. The vast majority of these commitments or
guarantees relate to LNC’s life insurance and retirement
businesses and, as such, are reflected on LNC’s balance
sheet. Any off-balance sheet commitments or guarantees that LNC
is subject to are disclosed within Review of Consolidated
Financial Condition and Note 7 Restrictions, Commitments
and Contingencies which is included in the notes to consolidated
financial statements.

On pages 19 through 56, the results of
operations of LNC consolidated, LNC’s four business

Overview: Results of Consolidated
Operations

Summary Information

Summary

Comparison of
2002 to 2001

Net income decreased $498.6 million or 84%.
The decrease in net income included an increase in realized
losses on investments and derivatives of $102.8 million and
expenses totaling $199.1 million recorded in 2002 related
to increases in reserves for the business sold through indemnity
reinsurance to Swiss Re. The realized losses on investments
resulted from declines in value and the sale and write-downs of
fixed maturity securities. See the Consolidated Investment
section for further discussion of this matter.



A significant contributor to the decrease in net
income was the poor performance of the equity markets impact on
fee income, DAC and PVIF amortization and GMDB reserves and
benefits. The equity market impact is discussed in more detail
within the discussion of results of operations by segment.

Consolidated revenue decreased primarily due to
the reduction of revenue of $1,699.4 million (pre-tax),
excluding realized losses on investments, from the former
Reinsurance segment in 2001. Another contributor to the decline
in revenue was the increase in realized losses on investments
noted above. Included in 2002 revenue was $74.4 million
(pre-tax) for the amortization of the deferred gain on indemnity
reinsurance compared to $20.4 million in 2001. The Lincoln
Retirement and Lincoln UK segments experienced decreased fee
income due to the negative impact that 2001 and 2002 equity
market declines had on average variable annuity (Retirement) and
unit-linked (Lincoln UK) account values. The Investment
Management segment had decreased investment advisory fees and
other revenue and fees as a result of lower retail and
institutional assets under management during 2002. The decrease
in assets under management was primarily a result of the
declining equity markets.

Consolidated expenses (excluding goodwill
amortization, restructuring charges, reserve increases on
business sold through reinsurance and federal income taxes)
decreased by $1,202.0 million or 22% largely due to the
sale of LNC’s reinsurance business to Swiss Re in the
fourth quarter of 2001. Expenses for the operations of the
former Reinsurance segment, excluding goodwill amortization,
were $1,503.7 million in 2001. Expenses were negatively
affected by the decline in the equity markets which resulted in
negative unlocking of DAC and PVIF in the Lincoln Retirement,
Life Insurance and Lincoln UK business segments, and increased
reserves and payments for GMDB in the Lincoln Retirement segment.

For 2002, LNC reported a tax benefit of
$90.0 million on $1.6 million of pre-tax earnings.
This unusual relationship between tax benefit and pre-tax
earnings results from the fact that LNC has tax-preferred
investment income that does not change proportionately with the
change in consolidated pre-tax earnings. LNC’s
tax-preferred investment income is primarily the result of
dividend received deductions attributable to LNC’s
allocable share of dividend income generated by equity
securities held within the Lincoln Retirement segments’
separate accounts. See note 4, Federal Income Taxes, to the
consolidated financial statements for more details.

Comparison of
2001 to 2000

Net income for 2001 was $590.2 million
compared to $621.4 million for 2000, a $31.2 million
or 5% decrease. Restructuring charges, net of the release of
liabilities, included in net income in 2001 and 2000 were
$24.7 million and $80.2 million, respectively.
Contributing to the decrease in 2001 were realized losses on
investments and derivative instruments of $73.6 million in
2001 compared to $17.5 million in 2000. These investment
losses were due primarily to losses of $41.8 million
(pre-tax) taken on Enron and Argentina securities in the fourth
quarter of 2001 in addition to increased write-downs of other
securities throughout 2001 due to credit deterioration.
Partially offsetting the additional losses in 2001 was the gain
on sale of certain reinsurance stock companies to Swiss Re of
$15.0 million. The remaining $30.1 million decrease in Net
Income between years was primarily the result of decreased
earnings from the Lincoln Retirement and Investment Management
segments, as well as LNC’s distributors, LFA and LFD, which
are reported in Other Operations. These negative variances were
partially offset by improved earnings from the Life Insurance
segment and the former Reinsurance segment, included within
Other Operations. In addition, included in net income for 2001
was one month’s amortization of the deferred gain on the
business transferred to Swiss Re via indemnity reinsurance.
There was also a decrease in the net loss from LNC Financing and
Other Corporate within Other Operations.

Total revenue, excluding realized gains and
losses on investments and derivative instruments and gain on
sale of subsidiaries, decreased by $395.7 million or 6% in 2001
due primarily to lower fee income in the Lincoln Retirement
segment and lower investment advisory fees in the Investment
Management segment resulting from the depressed equity markets
in 2001 and to a lesser extent to net outflows in annuities and
investment products. In addition, Lincoln UK had a decrease in
operating revenue due to lower business volume along with lower
fee income resulting from a downturn in the United Kingdom
equity markets over



the last half of 2001. The former Reinsurance
segment’s operating revenue was down in 2001 as its results
only included eleven months of activity. Finally, LFA and LFD
included in Other Operations had lower sales revenue largely
attributable to the volatile equity markets. Partially
offsetting these negative variances, the Life Insurance segment
had increased operating revenue due to growth in life insurance
in-force.

Total expenses, exclusive of restructuring
charges and Federal income taxes, decreased by
$329.9 million or 6% in 2001 due primarily to decreased
expenses in the Lincoln UK segment as a result of the decrease
in business volume along with effective expense management. The
former Reinsurance segment had a decrease due to only eleven
months of expenses being reported for its operations. However,
included in 2001 expenses for the former Reinsurance segment
were losses recorded for the events of September 11. The
Lincoln Retirement segment had a decrease in expenses due
primarily to less amortization of deferred acquisition costs and
other intangible assets partially offset by increased operating
and administrative expenses and benefits expenses. The
Investment Management segment also experienced decreased
expenses due to effective expense management and lower
amortization of other intangibles assets. Partially offsetting
these positive variances were increases in expenses in the Life
Insurance segment, as well as LFD and LFA. Expenses increased in
the Life Insurance segment primarily as a result of the growth
in in-force, which drove interest credited to policyholders
higher. LFD had higher expenses primarily as a result of its
investment in new wholesalers during 2001 and LFA experienced an
increase in general and administrative expenses partially offset
by a decrease in commissions and other volume-related expenses.
These expenses fell as a direct result of lower sales volume in
2001. For further discussion of the results of operations, see
the discussion of the results of operations by segment.

LNC’s domestic consolidated product deposits
and net flows were as follows:

First Quarter
2003 Guidance for the Estimated Effect of Equity Market
Volatility

In prior periods, Lincoln National Corporation
(“LNC”) provided guidance on the estimated effect of
equity market volatility on its 2002 results. The following
guidance is being provided for purposes of modeling the expected
effects of equity market volatility for the first quarter of
2003. As will be explained in greater



detail below, the effects on LNC’s results
of significant volatility in equity markets are complex and are
not expected to be proportional for market increases and market
decreases. The first quarter 2003 information provided below is
based upon market conditions and LNC’s mix of business as
of the beginning of the year. This guidance can be expected to
change as actual circumstances change. Although LNC believes
this guidance provides reasonable estimates based upon
conditions as of January 1, 2003, LNC claims no
responsibility for updating this forward-looking information.

This guidance is intended to provide a general
indication of the expected effect of equity market volatility on
LNC’s fee income; deferred acquisition costs
(“DAC”) and present value of in-force
(“PVIF”) intangible assets; and guaranteed minimum
death benefit (“GMDB”) reserves. Excluded from this
guidance is the effect that equity market changes may have upon
LNC’s realized and unrealized gains and losses on
investments and intangible assets, other than DAC and PVIF. For
example, write-downs for impairment of goodwill and deferred
dealer commission assets may be necessary under certain market
conditions. These matters are not included within the guidance
provided in this document.

In measuring the estimated effects of changes in
equity markets on its Retirement segment, LNC uses the
S&P 500 index. LNC has generally found that the
S&P 500 index is reasonably correlated to the effect of
overall equity markets performance on this segment’s
account values. Because LNC’s fee income earned on its
variable annuity business is determined daily, the change in the
S&P 500 on a daily average basis relative to the level of
the S&P 500 at the beginning of each quarter provides a
reasonable indication of the impact quarterly changes in equity
markets have on the Retirement segment’s fee income.
Because end of period account values are used for computing DAC
unlocking and for incurred GMDB costs, the end of period change
in the S&P 500 is used in measuring the estimated
market impact of DAC unlocking and for the impact associated
with incurred GMDB costs. In addition, because DAC and GMDB
calculations have an assumed 9% positive annual equity market
return, or a 2.25% quarterly assumption, variances in actual
market performance relative to these calculation assumptions
will generate positive or negative DAC unlocking and GMDB
adjustments.

It is important to understand that the actual
effect on fee income of market changes in the current quarter of
an equity market change and the effect in the immediately
following quarter will not be equal to a pro-rata 25% of the
estimated annualized effect of the market change. This is due to
the fact that the actual change in fee income in the immediate
quarter during which the market changes is measured by the
change in actual variable account values from the beginning of
the quarter compared to the average balance of variable account
values for the quarter. The change in fee income due to the
change from average account values to ending account values does
not occur in the immediate quarter of the market change; rather,
that change in fee income will occur in the quarter following
the market change. LNC estimates that this lagging effect for
the fourth quarter 2002 equity markets change will create a
decrease of $0.5 million in fee income in the first quarter
of 2003, because average account values for the fourth quarter
of 2002 exceeded the level of ending account values at
December 31, 2002.

LNC also uses the S&P 500 index when
describing the general effects of changes in equity markets for
the Life Insurance segment. For the Lincoln UK segment, the
FTSE 100 index provides a reasonable measure for
approximating the effect of equity markets performance on
earnings. LNC estimates that the lagging effect for the fourth
quarter 2002 equity markets change will create a decrease of
$0.1 million in fee income for Lincoln UK in the first
quarter of 2003, because average account values for the fourth
quarter of 2002 exceeded the level of ending account values at
December 31, 2002.

Additional market indices are used in measuring
the effects of the market on the results of LNC’s
Investment Management segment. All of the relevant equity market
indices (S&P, NASDAQ and MSCI EAFE) declined during the
third quarter, ranging from a 19.9% NASDAQ decline to a 19.7%
decline in the MSCI EAFE index. The fourth quarter increases
were a 13.9% increase in the NASDAQ and a 6.5% increase in the
MSCI EAFE index. The ongoing effect of the fourth quarter equity
markets increase is expected to be a $0.1 million increase
in the first quarter of 2003.

The following discussion concerning the estimated
effects of ongoing equity market volatility on LNC’s
earnings is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary
depending on a variety of factors, many of which



are outside of LNC’s control, such as
changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the
mix of LNC’s business between variable or fixed annuity
contracts, switching between investment alternatives available
within variable products, or changes in policy lapsation rates.
The relative effects shown in the illustrative scenarios
presented below should not be considered to be indicative of the
proportional effects on earnings that more significant changes
in equity markets may generate. Such non-proportional effects
include those discussed earlier, such as incurred GMDB costs and
DAC unlocking.

Since the effect of continued equity market
volatility is complex and subject to a variety of estimates and
assumptions, such as assumed rates of long-term equity market
performance, it is difficult to provide information that can be
reliably applied to predict earnings effects over a broad range
of equity markets performance alternatives. But in an effort to
provide some insight into these matters, LNC has provided below
illustrative examples of the effects that equity market
volatility might be expected to have on LNC’s earnings. The
underlying assumptions regarding these illustrations are as
follows:

1)

The first scenario assumes that equity markets
    remain unchanged from their respective levels at
    December 31, 2002 through the first quarter of 2003.

2)

The second scenario assumes that from
    December 31, 2002 through the end of the first quarter of
    2003 equity markets increase smoothly by 2.5%.

3)

The third scenario assumes that from
    December 31, 2002 through the end of the first quarter of
    2003 equity markets decline smoothly by 2.5%.

As the above assumptions indicate, actual equity
market changes that may have occurred since December 31,
2002 up to the date of issuance of this guidance are not being
considered; rather, the examples that follow are provided to
illustrate the effects of a hypothetical change in equity
markets from December 31, 2002. The following tables are
examples of the estimated effects on earnings that might be
expected for each of these scenarios.

Scenario #1:

No change in equity markets from
December 31, 2002 through March 31, 2003.

Estimated Effect on First Quarter of 2003
Results (Million $):

*

Differences exist in the market change effect on
    fee income for the current quarter, as compared to the ongoing
    quarterly effect, because the change in fee income in the
    immediate quarter is determined by the change in beginning
    variable account balances to average variable account balances
    for the current quarter. The change in fee income in the next
    subsequent quarter is determined by the change in average
    account values to ending variable account values that occurred
    due to the market changing in the preceding quarter.



However, in all following quarters, the ongoing
    effect of changes in the market occurring in the current quarter
    will be determined by the difference in beginning of quarter to
    end of quarter variable account balances. For purposes of this
    guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate
    with the change in the relevant index.

Scenario #2:

2.5% increase in equity markets from
December 31, 2002 to March 31, 2003

occurs smoothly during the quarter.

Results (Million $):

Scenario #3:

2.5% decline in equity markets from
December 31, 2002 to March 31, 2003

occurs smoothly during the quarter.

The above table excludes the impact of an
    impairment of the deferred dealer commission asset within the
    Investment Management segment. For instance, a review of the
    deferred dealer commission asset was performed as of
    March 10, 2003. Based on information currently available,
    it is estimated that a decline of approximately 3% in the equity
    markets from March 10, 2003 levels may trigger a loss,
    which would range from approximately $7.4 million to
    $11.4 million after-tax with the application of assumed
    discount rates ranging between 10% to 18% for purposes of
    measuring the fair value of the deferred dealer commission
    asset. The estimated balance of the deferred dealer commission
    asset as of March 10, 2003 was approximately
    $50 million.

The above examples are based upon the estimated
annual effect on earnings for each one-percentage point change
in relevant equity market indices. Taking one-fourth of this
annual estimate would generate the expected effect of the equity
market change on quarterly results, with the exception of DAC
unlocking and GMDB incurred cost calculations where the effect
is fully reflected in one quarter. The estimated annual effect
in millions of dollars per one-percentage change and the changes
in each of the relevant market indices used in the above
examples, are listed in the following table.

*

The above table excludes the impact of an
    impairment of the deferred dealer commission asset within the
    Investment Management segment. For instance, a review of the
    deferred dealer commission asset was performed as of
    March 10, 2003. Based on information currently available,
    it is estimated that a decline of approximately 3% in the equity
    markets from March 10, 2003 levels may trigger a loss,
    which would range from approximately $7.4 million to
    $11.4 million after-tax with the application of assumed
    discount rates ranging between 10% to 18% for purposes of
    measuring the fair value of the deferred dealer commission
    asset. The estimated balance of the deferred dealer commission
    asset as of March 10, 2003 was approximately
    $50 million.

As the above table indicates, the annual effect
of a one percent change in equity markets varies depending upon
the severity of the change. Presented below are estimated one
million dollar effects for various market changes that are
currently used by LNC in modeling the Lincoln Retirement
segment. These estimated



effects are subject to ongoing modification, as
they are particularly sensitive to the mix of business and to
the actual level of variable account balances.

The following table provides the annual effect
for changes in equity markets for the Lincoln Retirement segment
related to fee income and other:

The estimated annual effects indicated in the
table above are applicable for the first quarter of 2003. For
example, assume an estimate is being computed for the quarterly
effect on Lincoln Retirement’s fee income due to a 2.5%
increase in the markets occurring in the first quarter of 2003.
In this example, the expected quarterly effect of a first
quarter 2.5% increase is estimated as: ($2.0*1.25/4) =
$0.625 million.

The table provided below contains information for
use in estimating the first quarter 2003 effect for changes in
equity markets for the Lincoln Retirement segment related to
GMDB and DAC. For GMDB, quarterly results will include a reserve
adjustment. This is due to the fact that LNC has established the
GMDB reserves net of anticipated future GMDB fee revenues. As a
result, an adjustment will be required to increase GMDB reserves
during periods where a GMDB Net Amount At Risk exists.

Based upon the Net Amount At Risk for GMDB at
December 31, 2002, the first quarter 2003 GMDB reserve
adjustment is estimated at $5.9 million (included in the no
change column in the table below).

The estimated quarterly effects indicated in the
table above are applicable for the first quarter of 2003. For
example, assume an estimate is being computed for the quarterly
effect on Lincoln Retirement’s GMDB reserve due to a 2.5%
increase in the equity markets occurring in the first quarter of
2003. The estimated quarterly effect is calculated as follows:
$(5.9) + 0.8*2.5 = $(3.9) million.

Accounting for Business Combinations and
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, “Business Combinations”
(“FAS 141”), and No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”).
FAS 141 is effective for all business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001, and FAS 142 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets are no longer amortized, but are subject to
impairment tests conducted at least annually in accordance with
the new standards. Intangible assets that do not have indefinite
lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful
lives. LNC adopted FAS 142 on January 1, 2002. After
consideration of the provisions of the new standards regarding
proper classification of goodwill and other intangible assets on
the consolidated balance sheet, LNC did not reclassify any
goodwill or other intangible balances held as of January 1,
2002.

In compliance with the transition provision of
FAS 142, LNC completed the first step of the transitional
goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of 2002. The
valuation techniques used by LNC to estimate the fair value of
the group of assets comprising the different reporting units
varied based on the characteristics of each reporting
unit’s business and operations. A number of valuation
approaches, including discounted cash flow modeling, were used
to assess the goodwill of the reporting units within LNC’s
Lincoln Retirement, Life Insurance and Lincoln UK segments.
Valuation approaches combining multiples of revenues, earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(“EBITDA”) and assets under management were used to
estimate the fair value of the reporting units within LNC’s
Investment Manage-



ment segment. The results of the first step of
the tests indicated that LNC did not have impaired goodwill. LNC
has chosen October 1 as its annual review date. As such, LNC
performed another valuation review during the fourth quarter of
2002. The results of the first step of the tests performed as of
October 1, 2002 indicated that LNC did not have impaired
goodwill. The valuation techniques used by LNC for each
reporting unit were consistent with those used during the
transitional testing.

As a result of the application of the
non-amortization provisions of the new standards, LNC had an
increase in net income of $41.7 million ($0.22 per common
share on a fully diluted basis) for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”), which
supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 121, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
Opinion No. 30. FAS 144 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. LNC adopted FAS 144 on
January 1, 2002 and the adoption of the Statement did not
have a material impact on the consolidated financial position
and results of operations of LNC.

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities” (“FAS 146”), which addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with
exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)” (“Issue 94-3”). The principal
difference between FAS 146 and Issue 94-3 is that FAS 146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred,
rather than at the date of an entity’s commitment to an
exit plan. FAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities
after December 31, 2002. Adoption of FAS 146 by LNC will result
in a change in timing of when expense is recognized for
restructuring activities after December 31, 2002.

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.

On December 31, 2002, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure” (“FAS 148”), which provides
alternative methods of transition for entities that change to
the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” to require expanded and more prominent
disclosure of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy
with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported
net income and earnings per share in annual and interim
financial statements.

The three transition methods provided under
FAS 148 are the prospective, the modified prospective and
the retroactive restatement methods. LNC will adopt the
retroactive restatement method, which requires that companies
restate all periods presented to reflect stock-based employee
compensation cost under the fair value accounting method in
FAS 123 for all employee awards granted, modified or
settled in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994.
FAS 148’s amendment of the transition and annual
disclosure requirements of FAS 123 is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2002. LNC will adopt the
fair value method of accounting under FAS 123, as amended
by FAS 148, as of January 1, 2003 and will present
restated financial statements for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000
in its first quarter 2003 filing on Form 10-Q (see
Note 1 for pro forma net income and pro forma basic and
diluted earnings per share amounts for 2002, 2001 and 2000 and
Note 6 for discussion of stock-based employee compensation
cost.).

Effective January 1, 2003, LNC’s stock
option employee compensation plan and long-term cash incentive
compensation plan were revised and combined to provide for
performance vesting, and to provide for awards that may be paid
out in a combination of stock options, performance shares of LNC
stock and cash. The



performance measures for the initial grant under
the new plan will be calculated over a three-year period from
grant date and will compare LNC’s performance relative to a
selected group of peer companies. Comparative performance
measures will include relative growth in earnings per share,
return on equity and total share performance. Certain
participants in the new plans will select from seven different
combinations of stock options, performance shares and cash in
determining the form of their award. Other participants will
have their award paid in performance shares. This plan will
replace the current LNC stock option plan; however, the separate
stock option incentive plans established by Delaware Investments
U.S., Inc. (“DIUS”) and DIAL Holding Company, Inc.
(“DIAL”), both wholly-owned subsidiaries of Delaware
Management Holdings, Inc., will continue. The revised long-term
incentive plan for 2003 is expected to result in about the same
amount of total expense as would have been reported in 2002 for
the stock option employee compensation plan, if stock options
had been expensed, combined with previously expensed accrual for
the long-term cash incentive plan. This estimated 2003 expense
is subject to uncertainty given that several assumptions are
required to be made regarding LNC’s performance.

Accounting for Variable Interest
Entities

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“Interpretation 46”), which
requires the consolidation of variable interest entities
(“VIE”) by an enterprise if that enterprise has a
variable interest that will absorb a majority of the VIE’s
expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the
entity’s expected residual returns if they occur, or both.
If one enterprise will absorb a majority of a VIE’s
expected losses and another enterprise will receive a majority
of that VIE’s expected residual returns, the enterprise
absorbing a majority of the losses shall consolidate the VIE.
VIE refers to an entity in which equity investors do not have
the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do
not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support
from other parties. This Interpretation applies in the third
quarter of 2003 to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a variable
interest that is acquired before February 1, 2003. This
Interpretation may be applied prospectively with a
cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first
applied or by restating previously issued financial statements
for one or more years with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the beginning of the first year restated.

Among the matters that LNC is currently reviewing
in connection with the third quarter 2003 effective date of
Interpretation No. 46 to existing VIEs is the potential
application to Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) pools
that are managed by LNC. If the fees earned by LNC for managing
these CDOs are required to be included in the analysis of
expected residual returns, it is possible that such CDO pools
would fall under the consolidation requirements of
Interpretation No. 46. While LNC does not currently have
access to all information necessary to determine the ultimate
effects of such a required consolidation (because LNC is not the
trustee or the administrator to the CDOs), based upon currently
available information LNC estimates that the effect of
consolidation would result in recording additional assets and
liabilities on LNC’s consolidated balance sheet of about
$1.3 billion. If such liabilities are required to be
recorded, LNC would disclose that such liabilities are without
recourse to LNC, as LNC’s role of investment manager for
such CDO pools does not expose LNC to risk of loss.

Although LNC and the industry continue to review
the new rules, at the present time LNC does not believe there
are other significant VIEs that would result in consolidation
with LNC, beyond the managed CDOs discussed above.

Accounting for Modified Coinsurance

Currently, there are ongoing discussions
surrounding the implementation and interpretation of SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”, by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board’s (“FASB”) Derivative Implementation Group
regarding receivables and payables that are indexed to a pool of
assets; and specific to LNC, modified coinsurance agreements and
coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements that
reference a pool of securities. An exposure draft for this issue
has been issued by the FASB. It is not expected to be finalized
by the FASB until sometime in the second quarter of



2003. If the definition of derivative instruments
is altered, this may impact LNC’s prospective reported
consolidated net income and consolidated financial position.
Until the FASB finalizes the Statement 133 Implementation Issue,
LNC is unable to determine what, if any, impact it will have on
LNC’s consolidated financial statements.

Restructuring Charges

During 1998, LNC implemented a restructuring plan
relating to the integration of existing life and annuity
operations with the new business operations acquired from CIGNA
Corporation (“CIGNA”) and a second restructuring plan
relating to the streamlining of LNC’s corporate center
operations. The aggregate charges associated with these two
unrelated restructuring plans totaled $34.3 million
after-tax ($52.8 million pre-tax) and were included in
Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses on the
Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended
December 31, 1998. These aggregate pre-tax costs include
$19.6 million for employee severance and termination
benefits, $9.9 million for asset impairments and
$23.3 million for costs relating to exiting business
activities. The CIGNA restructuring plan was completed in the
first quarter of 2000. During the fourth quarter of 2000, $0.5
million (pre-tax) of the original charge to downsize LNC’s
corporate center operations was reversed. This plan was
completed in the third quarter of 2002 due to the termination of
the lease, which resulted from LNC’s purchase and ultimate
sale of the abandoned building. The remaining $0.2 million
related to the terminated lease was reversed as a reduction in
restructuring costs during the third quarter of 2002. Total
pre-tax costs of $56.2 million were expended or written-off
under these restructuring plans.

During 1999, LNC implemented restructuring plans
relating to 1) the downsizing and consolidation of the
operations of Lynch & Mayer, Inc. (“Lynch &
Mayer”); 2) the discontinuance of HMO excess-of-loss
reinsurance programs and 3) the streamlining of Lincoln
UK’s operations. The aggregate charges associated with
these three unrelated restructuring plans totaled
$21.8 million after-tax ($31.8 million pre-tax) and
were included in Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other
Expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year
ended December 31, 1999. During the fourth quarter of 1999,
$3.0 million (pre-tax) of the original charge recorded for
the Lynch & Mayer restructuring plan was reversed as a
reduction of restructuring costs due primarily to a change in
estimate for space costs. In addition, during the fourth quarter
of 1999, $1.5 million (pre-tax) associated with lease
terminations was released into income. During the fourth quarter
of 2000, the Lynch & Mayer restructuring plan was completed
and $0.3 million (pre-tax) of the original charge recorded
was reversed as Lynch & Mayer was able to successfully exit
certain contracts without any further obligations or penalties.
Also, during the fourth quarter of 2000, $1.0 million
(pre-tax) of the original charge for the discontinuance of HMO
excess-of-loss reinsurance programs was reversed. During the
fourth quarter of 2001, the remaining restructuring reserve of
$0.2 million relating to the HMO excess-of-loss reinsurance
programs was transferred to Swiss Re as part of its acquisition
of LNC’s reinsurance operations. Actual pre-tax costs
totaling $24.8 million have been expended or written-off
for all three plans through December 31, 2002. As of
December 31, 2002, a balance of $2.5 million remains
in the restructuring reserve for the Lincoln UK plan and is
expected to be utilized in the completion of this plan.
Additional details of each of the three restructuring plans are
discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

During 2000, LNC implemented restructuring plans
relating to 1) the downsizing and consolidation of the
operations of Vantage Global Advisors, Inc.
(“Vantage”); 2) the exit of all direct sales and
sales support operations of Lincoln UK and the consolidation of
its Uxbridge home office with its Barnwood home office, and
3) the downsizing and consolidation of the investment
management operations of Lincoln Investment Management. The
Vantage restructuring charge was recorded in the second quarter,
the Lincoln UK restructuring charge was recorded in the third
and fourth quarters, and the Lincoln Investment Management
restructuring was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000. The
aggregate charges associated with all restructuring plans
entered into during 2000 totaled $81.8 million after-tax
($107.4 million pre-tax). These charges were included in
Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses on the
Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The component elements of these
aggregate pre-tax costs include employee severance and
termination benefits of $33.8 million, write-off of
impaired assets of $40.9 million and other exit costs of
$32.7 million. During the fourth quarter of 2000,
$0.6 million (pre-tax) of



the original charge recorded for the Vantage
restructuring plan was reversed as a reduction of restructuring
costs due primarily to changes in estimates associated with
severance and abandoned leased office space costs. All
expenditures and write-offs for the Lincoln Investment
Management restructuring plan were completed in the third
quarter of 2002 and $0.4 million of the original reserve
was released. The release of the reserve was primarily due to
LNC’s purchase and ultimate sale of the vacant office space
on terms, which were favorable to what was included in the
original restructuring plan for rent on this office space. In
the fourth quarter of 2002, $1.7 million of the Lincoln UK
restructuring reserve was released as a result of new tenants
being contracted for several of the abandoned office facilities
on terms that were better than originally expected. Actual
pre-tax costs totaling $95.0 million have been expended or
written off for these plans through December 31, 2002. As
of December 31, 2002, a balance of $9.7 million
remains in the restructuring reserve for the Lincoln UK plan and
is expected to be utilized in the completion of the plan.
Additional details of each of the three restructuring plans are
discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
statements.

During 2001, LNC implemented restructuring plans
relating to 1) the consolidation of the Syracuse operations
of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York into the
Lincoln Retirement segment’s operations in Fort Wayne,
Indiana and Portland, Maine; 2) the elimination of
duplicative functions in the Schaumburg, Illinois operations of
First Penn-Pacific, and the absorption of these functions into
the Lincoln Retirement and Life Insurance segments operations in
Fort Wayne, Indiana and Hartford, Connecticut; 3) the
reorganization of the life wholesaling function within the
independent planner distribution channel, consolidation of
retirement wholesaling territories, and streamlining of the
marketing and communications functions in LFD; 4) the
reorganization and consolidation of the life insurance
operations in Hartford, Connecticut related to the streamlining
of underwriting and new business processes and the completion of
outsourcing of administration of certain closed blocks of
business; 5) the consolidation of the Boston, Massachusetts
investment and marketing office with the Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania investment and marketing operations in order to
eliminate redundant facilities and functions within the
Investment Management segment 6) the combination of LFD
channel oversight, positioning of LFD to take better advantage
of ongoing “marketplace consolidation” and expansion
of the customer base of wholesalers in certain territories and
7) the consolidation of operations and space in LNC’s
Fort Wayne, Indiana operations.

The Syracuse restructuring charge was recorded in
the first quarter of 2001, the Schaumburg, Illinois
restructuring charge was recorded in the second quarter of 2001,
the LFD restructuring charges were recorded in the second and
fourth quarters of 2001, and the remaining restructuring charges
were all recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The aggregate
charges associated with all restructuring plans entered into
during 2001 totaled $24.6 million after-tax
($38.0 million pre-tax). The component elements of these
aggregate pre-tax costs include employee severance and
termination benefits of $12.2 million, write-off of impaired
assets of $3.3 million and other exit costs of
$22.5 million primarily related to the termination of
equipment leases ($1.4 million) and rent on abandoned
office space ($20.0 million). The Syracuse restructuring
plan was completed in the first quarter of 2002 with
expenditures and write-offs totaling $1.3 million. The
total amount expended exceeded the original charge by
$0.3 million. The LFD restructuring plan that was initiated
in the second quarter of 2001 was completed in the fourth
quarter of 2002. Actual pre-tax costs totaling $1.8 million were
expended or written off, which was equal to the original
reserve. The Life Insurance segment restructuring plan that was
initiated in the fourth quarter of 2001 was completed in the
fourth quarter of 2002. Actual pre-tax costs totaling $2.3
million dollars were expended or written-off. The amount
expended for this plan was in excess of the original reserve by
less than $0.1 million. In addition, $0.1 million of excess
reserve on the FPP restructuring plan was released during the
second quarter of 2002 and $1.5 million of excess reserve
on the Fort Wayne restructuring plan was released during the
third quarter of 2002. The release of the reserve on the Fort
Wayne restructuring plan was due to LNC’s purchase and
ultimate sale of the vacant building on terms which were
favorable to what was included in the original restructuring
plan for rent on this abandoned office space. Actual pre-tax
costs totaling $34.0 million have been expended or written
off for the four remaining plans through December 31, 2002.
As of December 31, 2002, a balance of $1.4 million
remains in the restructuring reserves for these plans and is
expected to be utilized in the completion of the plans.
Additional details of each of these restructuring plans are
discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.



During the second quarter of 2002, Lincoln
Retirement completed a review of its entire internal information
technology organization. As a result of that review, Lincoln
Retirement decided in the second quarter of 2002 to reorganize
its IT organization in order to better align the activities and
functions conducted within its own organization and its IT
service providers. This change was made in order to focus
Lincoln Retirement on its goal of achieving a common
administrative platform for its annuities products, to better
position the organization and its service providers to respond
to changing market conditions, and to reduce overall costs in
response to increased competitive pressures. The restructuring
plan implemented to achieve these objectives included aggregate
pre-tax costs of $1.6 million, composed of
$1.4 million for employee severance and $0.2 million
for employee outplacement. Actual pre-tax costs expended through
December 31, 2002 were $0.9 million. As of
December 31, 2002, a balance of $0.7 million remains
in the restructuring reserve for this plan and is expected to be
utilized in the completion of the plan. Additional details of
this restructuring plan are discussed in Note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements.

In January 2003, the Life Insurance segment
announced that it was realigning its operations in Hartford,
Connecticut and Schaumburg, Illinois to enhance productivity,
efficiency and scalability while positioning the segment for
future growth. The financial impact of the realignment will
result in the Life Insurance segment incurring costs of
approximately $15-$17 million after-tax during 2003. While
some savings may materialize in the second half of 2003, the
majority of the savings will be realized in 2004, at which time
the run-rate for operating and administrative expenses should be
reduced by $15-$20 million pre-tax.

In February 2003, Lincoln Retirement announced
plans to consolidate its fixed annuity operations in Schaumburg,
Illinois into Fort Wayne, Indiana. Restructuring costs under the
plan are expected to be $3-$5 million after-tax and are
expected to be incurred during 2003. The consolidation is
expected to result in pre-tax savings of approximately
$4-$6 million annually beginning in the third quarter of
2003.

Acquisition and Divestiture

On August 30, 2002, LNC acquired The
Administrative Management Group, Inc. (“AMG”), an
employee benefits record keeping firm for $21.6 million in
cash. Contingent payments up to an additional $14 million
will be paid over a period of 4 years (2003-2006) if
certain criteria are met. Any such contingent payments will be
expensed as incurred. AMG, a strategic partner of the Lincoln
Retirement segment for several years, provides record keeping
services for the Lincoln Alliance Program along with
approximately 400 other clients nationwide. As of
December 31, 2002, the application of purchase accounting
to this acquisition resulted in goodwill of $20.2 million.

On December 7, 2001, Swiss Re acquired
LNC’s reinsurance operation for $2.0 billion. In
addition, LNC retained the capital supporting the reinsurance
operation. After giving effect to the increased levels of
capital needed within the Life Insurance and Lincoln Retirement
segments that result from the change in the ongoing mix of
business under LNC’s internal capital allocation models,
the disposition of LNC’s reinsurance operation freed-up
approximately $100 million of retained capital.

The transaction structure involved a series of
indemnity reinsurance transactions combined with the sale of
certain stock companies that comprised LNC’s reinsurance
operation. At closing, an immediate gain of $15.0 million
after-tax was recognized on the sale of the stock companies. A
gain of $723.1 million after-tax ($1.1 billion pre-tax)
relating to the indemnity reinsurance agreements was reported at
the time of closing. This gain was recorded as a deferred gain
on LNC’s consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with the
requirements of FAS 113, and is being amortized into earnings at
the rate that earnings on the reinsured business are expected to
emerge, over a period of 15 years.

Effective with the closing of the transaction,
the former Reinsurance segment’s historical results were
moved into “Other Operations.” During December 2001
LNC recognized in Other Operations $5.0 million
($7.9 million pre-tax) of deferred gain amortization. In
addition, in December 2001, LNC recognized $7.9 million
($12.5 million pre-tax) of accelerated deferred gain
amortization relating to the fact that certain Canadian
indemnity reinsurance contracts were novated after the sale, but
prior to December 31, 2001.



On October 29, 2002 LNC and Swiss Re settled
disputed matters totaling about $770 million that had
arisen in connection with the final closing balance sheets
associated with Swiss Re’s acquisition of LNC’s
reinsurance operations. The settlement provided for a payment by
LNC of $195 million to Swiss Re, which was recorded by LNC
as a reduction in deferred gain. As a result of additional
information made available to LNC following the settlement with
Swiss Re in the fourth quarter of 2002, LNC recorded a further
reduction in the deferred gain of $51.6 million after-tax
($79.4 million pre-tax), as well as a $9.4 million
after-tax ($8.3 million pre-tax) reduction in the gain on
the sale of subsidiaries.

As part of the dispute settlement, LNC also paid
$100 million to Swiss Re in satisfaction of LNC’s
$100 million indemnification obligation with respect to
personal accident business. As a result of this payment, LNC has
no further underwriting risk with respect to the reinsurance
business sold. However, because LNC has not been relieved of its
legal liabilities to the underlying ceding companies with
respect to the portion of the business reinsured by Swiss Re,
under FAS 113 the reserves for the underlying reinsurance
contracts as well as a corresponding reinsurance recoverable
from Swiss Re will continue to be carried on LNC’s balance
sheet during the run-off period of the underlying reinsurance
business. This is particularly relevant in the case of the
exited personal accident and disability income reinsurance lines
of business where the underlying reserves are based upon various
estimates that are subject to considerable uncertainty.

As a result of developments and information
obtained during 2002 relating to personal accident and
disability income matters, LNC increased these exited business
reserves by $198.5 million after-tax ($305.4 million
pre-tax). After giving effect to LNC’s $100 million
indemnification obligation, LNC recorded a $133.5 after-tax
($205.4 million pre-tax) increase in reinsurance
recoverable from Swiss Re with a corresponding increase in the
deferred gain.

The combined effects of the 2002 settlement of
disputed matters and exited business reserve increases reduced
the $723.1 million after-tax ($1.1 billion pre-tax)
deferred gain reported at closing by $44.9 million
after-tax ($69 million pre-tax). During 2002, LNC amortized
$47 million after-tax ($72.3 million pre-tax) of
deferred gain. This includes the amortization of deferred gain
from the sale of the direct disability income business in 1999.
An additional $1.3 million after-tax ($2 million
pre-tax) of deferred gain was recognized due to a novation of
certain Canadian business during 2002.

Also during 2002, LNC exercised a contractual
right to “put” its interest in a subsidiary company
containing LNC’s disability income reinsurance business to
Swiss Re for $10 million. The $10 million sale price
was approximately equal to LNC’s book basis in the
subsidiary.

Through December 31, 2002, of the original
$2 billion in proceeds received by LNC, approximately
$0.56 billion was paid for taxes and deal expenses and
approximately $1.0 billion was used to repurchase stock,
reduce debt, and support holding company cash flow needs. LNC
also paid $195 million to Swiss Re to settle the closing
balance sheet disputed matters and $100 million to satisfy
LNC’s personal accident business indemnification
obligations. The remaining proceeds have been dedicated to the
ongoing capital needs of the Lincoln National Life Insurance
Company.

Critical Accounting Policy —
Personal Accident and Disability Income Reserves

Because of ongoing uncertainty related to
personal accident and disability income businesses, the reserves
related to these exited business lines carried on LNC’s
balance sheet at December 31, 2002 may ultimately prove to
be either excessive or deficient. For instance, in the event
that future developments indicate that these reserves should be
increased, under FAS 113 LNC would record a current period
non-cash charge to record the increase in reserves. Because
Swiss Re is responsible for paying the underlying claims to the
ceding companies, LNC would record a corresponding increase in
reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re. However, FAS 113 does not
permit LNC to take the full benefit in earnings for the
recording of the increase in the reinsurance recoverable in the
period of the change. Rather, LNC would increase the deferred
gain recognized upon the closing of the indemnity reinsurance
transaction with Swiss Re and would report a cumulative
amortization “catch-up” adjustment to the deferred
gain balance as increased earnings recognized in the period of
change. Any amount of additional increase to the deferred gain
above the cumulative amortization “catch-up”
adjustment must continue to be deferred and will be amortized
into income in future periods over



the remaining period of expected run-off of the
underlying business. No cash would be transferred between LNC
and Swiss Re as a result of these developments

Accordingly, even though LNC has no continuing
underwriting risk, and no cash would be transferred between LNC
and Swiss Re, in the event that future developments indicate
LNC’s December 31, 2002 personal accident or
disability income reserves are deficient or redundant, FAS 113
requires LNC to adjust earnings in the period of change, with
only a partial offset to earnings for the cumulative deferred
gain amortization adjustment in the period of change. The
remaining amount of increased gain would be amortized into
earnings over the remaining run-off period of the underlying
business.

Results of Operations by Segment

Lincoln
Retirement

The Lincoln Retirement segment (formerly known as
the Annuities segment), headquartered in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income
opportunities for its clients through the manufacture and sale
of fixed and variable annuities. Through a broad-based
distribution network, Lincoln Retirement provides an array of
annuity products to individuals and employer-sponsored groups in
all 50 states of the United States. Lincoln Retirement
distributes some of its products through LNC’s wholesaling
unit, LFD, as well as LNC’s retail unit, LFA. In addition,
group fixed and variable annuity products and the Alliance
program are distributed to the employer-sponsored retirement
market through Lincoln Retirement’s Fringe Benefit Division
dedicated sales force.

Results of Operations:

Lincoln Retirement’s financial
results and account values were as follows:

(1)

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes relates
    to the transition adjustment of $(3.6) million recorded in the
    first quarter of 2001 upon adoption of FAS 133 and the
    adjustment of $(3.7) million recorded in the second quarter of
    2001 upon adoption of EITF 99-20.



Comparison of
2002 to 2001

Net income decreased $211.4 million or 79%
in 2002. The decrease in net income between periods was
primarily the result of the decline in the equity markets and an
increase in realized losses on investments of
$86.2 million, resulting from the decline in value and the
sale and write-downs of fixed maturity securities.

In 2002, the S&P 500 index declined 23.4%.
The significant decline in the equity markets negatively
affected the segment’s earnings through lower fees from
lower average variable account values, negative unlocking of
deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and the present
value of in-force (“PVIF”) intangible assets and
increases in reserves and benefit payments for guaranteed
minimum death benefits (“GMDB”).

Average daily variable annuity account values
decreased $4.8 billion or 13% and variable annuity account
values at December 31, 2002 were $7.2 billion or 21%
lower than at December 31, 2001. The decrease in variable
annuity account values was caused primarily by the overall
decline in the equity markets in 2002. This decrease reduced
fees and lowered net income by $29.9 million. The effect of
equity market impact on DAC and PVIF from retrospective
unlocking and net changes in amortization decreased net income
by $18.4 million. The current year negative unlocking was
due to actual equity market performance lagging the expected
market performance used in LNC’s DAC assumptions. Increases
in GMDB reserves and benefit payments decreased net income by
$40.4 million from 2001. In addition, in the fourth quarter
of 2002 the segment had reduced net income of $30.3 million due
to prospective unlocking of various assumptions underlying DAC,
PVIF and GMDB calculations, including the reversion to the mean
net growth assumption. The tax benefit from the Separate Account
Dividend Received Deduction (“DRD”) was
$17.7 million lower in 2002 than in 2001 due to lower fees,
primarily resulting from the decline in the equity markets.

Decreased earnings from investment partnerships
resulted in a negative variance of $21.7 million compared
to 2001. Partially offsetting the negative variances were
$17.6 million from higher investment margins. Overall
investment spreads on fixed annuity products was relatively flat
between years: 2.04% in 2002 versus 2.05% in 2001. For annuity
products spread, the yield on earning assets is calculated as
net investment income on fixed product investment portfolios
divided by the average earning assets, the average crediting
rate is calculated using interest credited on annuity products
less bonus credits and excess dollar cost averaging
(“DCA”) interest, divided by the average fixed account
values net of coinsured account values. Fixed account values
reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in
account values for this calculation. (See discussion on
investment margins and the interest rate risk due to falling
interest rates within Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.)

Average fixed annuity account values increased
$2.1 billion in 2002 resulting in an increase in income of
$17.7 million. The increase in fixed annuity account values
was due to the positive net cash flows for fixed annuities,
reflecting strong sales of the StepFive®, Lincoln Select
and Lincoln ChoicePlus

SM

Fixed annuity products. (See
below for further discussion of net flows.) These strong sales
increases could be interrupted if the interest rates decrease
significantly and remain lower. In the event that LNC is not
able to achieve spread targets, sales of fixed annuities could
be significantly reduced.

Critical
Accounting Policy — Deferred Acquisition
Cost

The amortization of the Lincoln Retirement
segment’s deferred acquisition costs is impacted by the
change in market value of variable annuity accounts. Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 97, “Accounting
by Insurance Companies for Certain Long-Duration Contracts &
Realized Gains & Losses on Investment Sales” (“FAS
97”) requires that acquisition costs for variable annuity
contracts be amortized over the lives of the contracts in
relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits. Estimated
gross profits on variable annuity contracts vary based on
surrenders, fee income, expenses and realized gains/losses on
investments. The amortization is adjusted retrospectively (DAC
unlocking) when estimates of current or future gross profits to
be realized from variable annuity contracts are revised. Because
equity market movements have a significant impact on the value
of variable annuity accounts and the fees earned on these
accounts, estimated future profits increase or decrease with
movements in the equity markets. Movements in equity markets
also have an impact on reserves and payments for the guaranteed
minimum death benefit feature within certain annuity contracts.
The Lincoln Retirement segment’s assumption for the
long-term



annual gross growth rate of the equity markets
used in the determination of DAC amortization and GMDB benefits
is 9%, which is reduced by mortality and expense charges
(“M&E”) and asset management charges resulting in
a net variable account growth assumption of less than 9%. As
equity markets do not move in a systematic manner, LNC uses a
methodology referred to as “reversion to the mean” to
maintain its long-term gross growth rate assumption while also
giving consideration to the effect of short-term swings in the
equity markets. The application of this methodology results in
the use of a higher or lower future gross equity market growth
assumption for a period of four years subsequent to the
valuation date which, together with actual historical gross
equity growth, is expected to produce a 9% gross return.

The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is
common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the
methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the
industry. An important aspect of LNC’s application of the
reversion to the mean is the use of caps and floors on the
growth rate assumption, which limit the gross growth rate
assumption to reasonable levels above and below the long-term
assumption. In the fourth quarter 2002, LNC adjusted its
reversion to the mean gross growth rate assumption to 9%. This
change along with changes to assumptions for variable annuity
persistency and revisions to amortization periods resulted in
DAC and PVIF adjustments reducing income by $8.8 million.
Going forward, as the growth rate of the equity market varies
from LNC’s growth rate assumption, the period over which
the reversion to the mean gross growth rate assumption needs to
be earned will be four years. The segment is reviewing the
appropriate cap or floor levels and will incorporate this into
the methodology. On a quarterly basis, LNC reviews the
assumptions of its DAC amortization model and records a
retrospective adjustment to the amount expensed, (i.e. unlocks
the DAC). On an annual basis, LNC reviews and adjusts as
necessary its assumptions for prospective amortization of DAC,
as well as its other intangible asset, present value of in-force
(“PVIF”).

Critical
Accounting Policy — Guarantee Minimum Death Benefits
Reserving

The GMDB reserves are a function of the net
amount at risk (“NAR”), mortality, persistency, and
incremental death benefit M&E expected to be incurred over
the period of time for which the NAR is positive. At any given
point in time, the NAR is the difference between the potential
death benefit payable and the total account balance, with a
floor value of zero (when account values exceed the potential
death benefit there is no amount at risk). As part of the
estimate of future NAR, gross equity growth rates which are
consistent with those used in the DAC valuation process are
utilized. On average, the current gross equity growth rate would
project to a zero NAR over roughly four years from the balance
sheet date. The fourth quarter of 2002 change to the reversion
to the mean assumption resulted in an increase to GMDB reserves
and reduced income by $21.5 million. Projections of account
values and NAR followed by computation of the present value of
expected NAR death claims using product pricing mortality
assumptions less expected GMDB M&E revenue during the period
for which the death benefit options are assumed to be in the
money are made each valuation date for every variable annuity
contract with a GMDB benefit feature. If equity market returns
exactly match LNC’s reversion to the mean rate and actual
mortality and lapse experience is as assumed, the GAAP reserve
plus interest and GMDB M&E revenue would exactly cover the
future expected GMDB payments as they arise.

As discussed above, the decline of the equity
markets effect has resulted in increased GMDB reserves and
benefit payments which negatively effected Lincoln
Retirement’s income. Although there is no method currently
prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles for
GMDB reserving, LNC uses a method that recognizes that there is
an amount at risk that will result in future payments and that
over time the equity market growth will reduce the payment
stream. This approach is expected to cover future GMDB payments,
net of future GMDB fee income. Currently, there are few
companies that reserve for the liability caused by the decline
in the equity markets with some companies recognizing the cost
on a pay as you go basis. At December 31, 2002, LNC’s
net amount at risk (“NAR”) was $4.6 billion and
the GAAP reserve was $84.5 million. The reserve for
statutory accounting was $144.1 million, reflecting the
more conservative market performance and mortality assumptions
required under statutory accounting.

In evaluating the relative GMBD exposures that
exist within LNC’s variable annuity business relative to
industry peers, it is important to distinguish between the
various types of GMDB structures, and other factors



such as average account values, average amounts
of NAR, and the age of contractholders. The following discussion
provides this information for LNC’s variable annuity
business.

At December 31, 2002 LNC had
$19.2 billion of variable annuity account value, about 52%
of LNC’s total, that was subject to a return of premium
type GMDB benefit. LNC’s average variable annuity with a
return of premium feature has an average account value of
$32,000 and an average remaining premium base of $26,300
resulting in an average NAR of $5,700. The average attained age
of these contract holders is just over 50 with less than 9% over
age 70. The GAAP GMDB reserve on these accounts was
$27.2 million on a total NAR of $1.8 billion.

At December 31, 2002 LNC had
$9.1 billion of variable annuity account value, about 25%
of LNC’s total, that is subject to a high water mark type
GMDB benefit. LNC’s average variable annuity with a high
water mark feature has an average account value of $58,400 and
average NAR of $19,800. The average attained age of these
contract holders is just over 60 with 24% over age 70. The GAAP
GMDB reserve on these accounts was $56.9 million on a total
NAR of $2.8 billion.

At December 31, 2002 only $262 million
of variable account value, less than 1% of LNC’s total, was
subject to roll-up type GMDB benefit. LNC’s average
variable annuity with a roll-up feature has an average account
value of $91,000 and average NAR of $17,700. The average
attained age of these contract holders is just under 63 with 28%
over age 70. The GAAP GMDB reserve on these accounts was
$0.4 million on a total NAR of $40 million.

At December 31, 2002 LNC had
$8.5 billion of variable annuity account value, about 23%,
that was not subject to any GMDB benefit. These accounts average
$45,800 in account value. The average attained age of these
contract holders is 58 with 20% over 70.

LNC’s contract holders overall average
attained age is just over 53 with only 13% over age 70. LNC
average attained ages are lower than industry average (per The
Gallup Organization’s 2001 Survey) due to the mix of
business that includes significant amounts of qualified and
employer sponsored business.

LNC’s average non-qualified contract
holder’s attained age is just under 64 with 35% over age 72
compared to the industry average attained age of 65 with 35%
over age 72.

LNC has variable annuity contracts containing
GMDB’s which have a dollar for dollar withdrawal feature.
Under such a feature, withdrawals reduce both current account
value and the GMDB amount on a dollar for dollar basis. For
contracts containing this dollar for dollar feature, the account
holder could withdraw a substantial portion of their account
value resulting in a GMDB which is multiples of the current
account value. LNC’s exposure to this dollar for dollar
risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that LNC does not allow
for partial 1035 exchanges on non-qualified contracts. To take
advantage of the dollar for dollar feature, the contract holder
must take constructive receipt of the withdrawal and pay any
applicable surrender charges. LNC will report the appropriate
amount of the withdrawal that is taxable to the IRS, as well as
indicating whether or not tax penalties apply under the
premature distribution tax rules. LNC closely monitors its
dollar for dollar withdrawal GMDB exposure and works with key
broker dealers that distribute LNC’s variable annuity
products. As of December 31, 2002, there were 276 contracts
for which the death benefit to account value ratio was greater
than ten to one. The net amount at risk on these contracts was
$19.3 million. Effective May of 2003, the GMDB feature
offered on new sales will be a pro-rata GMDB feature whereby
each dollar of withdrawal will reduce the GMDB benefit in
proportion to the current GMDB to account value ratio.

As illustrated in the discussion of Lincoln
Retirement’s results of operations above, the
segment’s income is extremely sensitive to swings in the
equity markets. Refer to the First Quarter 2003 Guidance for
Estimated Effect of Equity Market Volatility section for
estimates of the effect of movements in the equity markets on
Lincoln Retirement’s earnings.

Comparison of
2001 to 2000

The $89.4 million or 25% decrease in net
income was due in part to an increase in realized loss on
investments and derivative instruments of $39.1 million.
These investment losses were due primarily to losses



taken on Enron and Argentina securities in the
fourth quarter of 2001 in addition to increased write-downs of
other securities throughout 2001 due to credit deterioration.

Weak performance of the equity markets in 2001
caused variable annuity account values to be depressed
throughout 2001. Fee income, which is calculated daily based on
the ending variable annuity account values, decreased
$48.9 million between years as a result of market
depreciation experienced in the last quarter of 2000 and overall
in 2001 and to a lesser extent, net outflows for variable
annuities in 2000. Average variable annuity account values
decreased by $6.2 billion or 15% in 2001 from 2000.
Variable annuity net flows (including the fixed portion of
variable contracts) were essentially zero for 2001 due to a
strong second half of the year. Partially offsetting the
decrease in fee income was a $6.2 million positive fee
income rate variance related to a change in mix of the variable
annuity business. The downturn in the equity markets also
contributed to an increase of $7.3 million in benefit
payments and reserve requirements for guaranteed minimum death
benefits. Average fixed annuity account values decreased by
$331 million or 1.9% in 2001 from the average in 2000 due
to net outflows in 2000. This decreased earnings by
$1.4 million between years. As a result of improved
retention and lower account values in 2001, surrender charges
decreased $6.9 million between years.

Increased operating and administrative expenses
of $16.2 million also contributed to the decrease in net
income between years. This increase was due primarily to higher
information technology costs including computer software
write-offs and equipment amortization, as well as increased
severance and relocation costs related to LNC’s initiative
to build a high performance culture.

Net investment income decreased between years due
primarily to reduced earnings of $5.2 million on investment
partnerships. Overall investment spreads on fixed annuity
products (excluding the impact of investment income earned on
surplus supporting the segment which includes investment
partnerships) decreased between years: 2.05% in 2001 versus
2.14% in 2000.

The Lincoln Retirement segment experienced
negative DAC unlocking in the first and third quarters of 2001
and positive unlocking in the second and fourth quarters of 2001
due to movements in the market. DAC unlocking created a negative
variance in earnings of $4.0 million compared to 2000. Due
to changes in assumptions for prospective DAC amortization made
at the beginning of 2001, the segment experienced a decrease in
DAC amortization expense of $37.8 million relative to 2000.
This unlocking created a positive variance of $4.5 million
between years, which was caused by improved persistency in 2001
and lower expense projections.

Net
Flows(1)

Lincoln Retirement’s product net flows were
as follows:



(1)

Incremental Deposits represent gross deposits
    reduced by transfers from other Lincoln Annuity products.

In order to achieve profitable future earnings
growth for both fixed and variable annuity products the ability
to attract new deposits and to retain existing accounts is
crucial. In 2002, the Lincoln Retirement segment experienced a
continuation of the trend of positive net flows that began in
the third quarter of 2001. For the year, total annuity deposits
were $6.4 billion, flat with 2001. However, withdrawals
were $5.9 billion, an improvement of $0.5 billion resulting
in positive net flows of $0.5 billion.

The improvement in net flows is reflective of
LNC’s goal of maintaining positive net flows by growing
deposits and retaining existing accounts. LNC has experienced
six consecutive quarters of positive net flows. This improvement
is largely attributable to LNC’s balanced array of products
and distribution breadth.

Although American Legacy Variable Annuity gross
deposits were down 14%, its incremental deposits decreased only
2% in 2002. In addition, Lincoln ChoicePlus

SM

with
its multi-manager variable annuity experienced a
$302 million or 40% increase in gross deposits in 2002. In
the first quarter of 2002, LFD launched Lincoln ChoicePlus in
UBS PaineWebber, one of the largest distributors of variable
annuity products in the country. Also, in April 2002, LFD
launched Lincoln ChoicePlus in Salomon Smith Barney, another key
distributor of variable annuity products. Sales of the SEI
Variable Annuity product line, distributed through SEI, declined
30% to $57 million in 2002. Effective February 28,
2003, SEI Investments will no longer take applications for new
contract sales in the SEI Variable Annuity Program. Total fixed
annuity gross deposits (excluding the fixed portion of variable
annuity gross deposits) were $1.9 billion in 2002, a
$0.2 billion or 12% increase. The increase was reflective
of the strong sales of the StepFive, Lincoln Select Fixed
Annuity and the Alliance Program Fixed Annuities.

At December 31, 2002, 52% of Lincoln
Retirement’s account values contained the most conservative
type of GMDB which is return of premium. There are two other
primary types of GMDB’s in the portfolio, the high-water
mark and the 5% step-up. The 5% step-up product accounts for
less than 1 percent of Lincoln Retirement’s variable
annuity account values. LNC is currently reviewing this feature
and other guarantees. In the future they may be changed or
discontinued.

LNC’s efforts to grow deposits by
introducing innovative products that meet the changing needs of
its customers and to retain existing accounts through targeted
conservation efforts and by offering better replacement
alternatives for current customers have yielded positive
results. In addition, Lincoln Retirement’s improvement in
flows is even more powerful when looking at current industry
activity. Aggressive pricing strategies aimed at increasing
market share which are prevalent in the marketplace, but counter
to LNC’s strategy, include significant commission specials
that are 100-200 basis points above LNC’s; aggressive
living benefit riders that give the customer the opportunity to
transfer market risk to the company at their discretion and
could ultimately spell disaster for either client or company;
and combination high bonus and high commission products that
could promote inappropriate sales behavior. LNC has been able to
grow new deposits without employing, to any significant extent,
the various aggressive strategies listed above. This progress
can be attributed to not only its strong product line-up and
distribution breadth, but also the implementation of more
stringent standards and controls on internal transfers.

Retention of
Assets

In looking at annuity withdrawals and the overall
profitability of the business, it is important to look beyond
the mere total dollar amount of withdrawals and assess how total
withdrawals compare to total retained account values. These
measures of account persistency are referred to as lapse rates,
which are key elements to assessing underlying profitability. By
comparing actual lapse rates to the rates assumed in designing
the annuity product, it is possible to gauge whether performance
is better or worse than pricing. Overall lapse rates were 10.47%
in 2002, 9.72% in 2001 and 11.95% in 2000. In all three years,
overall lapse rates have been more favorable than expected in
pricing assumptions. The improvement in persistency over the
three year period has partially countered the reduction in fee
income resulting from lower average variable annuity account
values caused by market depreciation.



To sustain and further improve overall retention
levels, LNC is utilizing targeted conservation efforts and is
exploring other retention initiatives. In addition, LNC believes
that maintaining a strong and balanced portfolio of fixed and
variable annuities provides a platform for maintaining positive
net flows. If equity markets continue to decline, LNC may see
increased exchange activity in 2003, particularly if consumers
move funds to products that provide an account value floor (i.e.
living benefits).

Growth of New
Deposits

LNC has been focused over the last several years
on growing new deposits. This effort has been concentrated on
both product and distribution breadth. As a result of the
continued volatility of the equity markets, sales of fixed
annuities have increased in spite of the historically low
interest rate environment. LNC’s fixed annuity sales in
2001 through 2002 were bolstered by product offerings that were
introduced in 2001 including the Lincoln Select Fixed Annuity
and the StepFive® Fixed Annuity. The guarantees of the
StepFive Fixed Annuity made it an important product for LNC in
the Financial Institutions channel. New product offerings
launched in 2002 in the Financial Institutions channel include
AccelaRate and ChoiceGuarantee. The market value adjusted
(“MVA”) feature of the Lincoln Select Fixed Annuity is
expected to be more attractive in the Wirehouse/ Regional
channel during a volatile interest rate environment. This
feature increases or decreases the cash surrender value of the
annuity based on a decrease or increase in interest rates.
Contractholders participate in gains when the contract is
surrendered in a falling interest rate market, and LNC is
protected from losses up to a cap when the contract is
surrendered in a rising interest rate market. A new version of
Lincoln Select that provides the individual with a higher
interest rate but a larger potential penalty for early
withdrawal or surrender is being developed. LNC continues to
approach the fixed annuity marketplace opportunistically and
only offer rates that are consistent with LNC’s required
spreads. If interest rates drop further, it may result in
reduced product offerings and could impact net flows.

In 2002, an enhanced low cost variable annuity
product, Multi-Fund 5 was launched. In addition, LNC expanded
the ChoicePlus and American Legacy product offerings in New York
to include Bonus, L-share and A-share (American Legacy only)
contracts. Annuities with living benefit riders, that provide
equity market performance guarantees, are becoming much more
prevalent in the industry. LNC is evaluating various product
approaches and designs in this area that will provide a
competitive benefit while still falling within LNC’s risk
tolerance levels for such guarantees.

LFD, LNC’s wholesaling distribution arm and
internal partner of Lincoln Retirement, provides a wholesaling
unit for the distribution of the Lincoln ChoicePlus variable
annuity, Lincoln ChoicePlus fixed annuity and StepFive fixed
annuity product lines. In 2002, LFD contributed significantly to
the level of ChoicePlus

SM

Variable Annuity sales
which reached $1.0 billion, an increase of 40% from 2001.
LFD has also been a driver of fixed annuity products with
$1.2 billion of sales in 2002. LNC is continuing to build
and reinvent its strategic partnerships as part of its ongoing
marketing strategy, while selectively working on other alliances
that will provide increased access for LNC annuity products
through various distribution channels. American Legacy variable
annuity gross deposits were $1.7 billion in 2002, a
decrease of 14% from 2001. One means for improving American
Legacy annuity sales would be the use of a dedicated wholesaling
team of Lincoln Insurance Planning Consultants focused strictly
on American Legacy Variable Annuity products. Recently, LNC and
American Funds Distributors (“AFD”) have agreed to
transition the wholesaling of American Legacy to LFD. Currently,
AFD uses wholesalers who focus on both American Funds mutual
funds as well as the American Legacy Variable Annuity products.
Segment management believes that this change to a dedicated team
focused on key broker/dealer relationships developed in
conjunction with AFD, has the potential to renew growth in
American Legacy VA sales. The transitioning of wholesaling and
distribution responsibility for the American Legacy variable
annuities from AFD to LFD will provide LFD with two distinct
annuity product areas: The single-manager (American Legacy) and
the multi-manager (ChoicePlus

SM

and Multi-Fund®).

Proposed Bush
Administration Tax Legislation

President Bush’s proposed 2003 budget
legislation contains a variety of changes to the taxation of
corporations and shareholders. Of particular importance to the
Lincoln Retirement segment are proposed



changes intended to mitigate the double taxation
of dividends. At this point, the potential impact of this
developing legislative proposal on annuities products is
uncertain. Concerns expressed in this regard by the industry
have been favorably received by key Bush administration
officials, with indications that these matters are being given
careful consideration during the ongoing drafting of the
legislative proposal. Also unknown at this time is the impact,
if any, that the proposed legislation may have on the Lincoln
Retirement segment future corporate tax burden, including how
corporate dividends would be treated under the proposed new
approach to corporate taxation. At this point, LNC is unable to
predict, with any degree of certainty, the likelihood or final
form in which this proposed legislation might become law.

Outlook

Tax legislation, along with current economic and
market conditions continue to be very uncertain which may
adversely affect annuity sales for the industry and Lincoln
Retirement. Although LNC is committed to its two-pronged
approach of growing new deposits and retaining existing assets
to manage its net flows; achieving positive net flows in 2003
may be difficult for the industry and Lincoln Retirement. LNC
expects to continue to strengthen its distribution breadth and
emphasize expense management as key profitability drivers in an
increasingly challenging market.

Life Insurance

The Life Insurance segment, headquartered in
Hartford, Connecticut, creates and protects wealth for its
clients through the manufacture and sale of life insurance
products throughout the United States. The Life Insurance
segment offers term life, universal life, variable universal
life, interest-sensitive whole life and corporate owned life
insurance. A majority of the Life Insurance segment’s
products are currently distributed through LFD and LFA. In the
third quarter 2002, the Life Insurance segment entered into a
marketing agreement to distribute life insurance products
through the M Financial Group, a well-respected and successful
nationwide organization of independent firms serving the needs
of affluent individuals and corporations. In addition to the
marketing agreement, most business sold through M Financial
Group will be subject to a 50% modified coinsurance arrangement.

Results of
Operations:

The Life Insurance
segment’s financial results, first year premiums by
product, account values and in-force amounts were as follows:



(1)

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes relates
    to the transition adjustment of $(0.2) million recorded in the
    first quarter of 2001 upon adoption of FAS No. 133 and the
    adjustment of $(5.3) million recorded in the second quarter of
    2001 upon adoption of EITF 99-20.

Comparison of
2002 to 2001

Net income decreased $24.1 million or 10% in
2002 from the prior year. Excluding the amortization of goodwill
in 2001, net income decreased $47.8 million or 19%. A
significant contributor to the decrease in net income between
periods was an increase in realized losses on investments of
$26.0 million primarily resulting from the write-down of fixed
maturity securities in 2002. In 2001, the Life Segment reported
two restructuring charges which reduced 2001 net income by
$3.5 million. There were no restructuring charges for the
segment in 2002. Also, in 2001 net income was negatively
affected by $5.5 million to due the cumulative effect of
the adopting FAS. No. 133 and EITF 99-20. There were no
accounting principles adopted in 2002 requiring a cumulative
adjustment.

In addition to the items noted above, other
factors contributing to the decline in net income in 2002
compared to 2001 were less favorable mortality, declining
investment margins, poor results in investment partnerships and
declines in the equity markets.

Mortality experience (mortality assessments less
net death benefits and negative DAC unlocking) in 2002 was less
favorable relative to 2001 and resulted in a $13.1 million
reduction in income. Volatility is expected from mortality risk,
but LNC attempts to lessen the impact of volatility on earnings
by reinsuring approximately 90% of the new business written by
the Life Insurance segment. Investment yields declined at a
faster pace than reductions in crediting rates which reduced
investment margins $10.5 million. (See discussion on
investment margins and the interest rate risk due to falling
interest rates within Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.) In addition, decreased earnings
from investment partnerships resulted in a negative variance of
$6.7 million.

Life insurance in-force, increased 8% from
December 31, 2001 due to strong sales growth over the last
year and continued favorable persistency. Total sales as
measured by first year premiums were up $154.8 million or
25% and retail sales were up $113.9 million or 20% in 2002.
Sales of universal life (“UL”), whole life and term
life insurance products improved by 69%, 15% and 5%,
respectively. Due to the volatile equity markets experienced
over the last several quarters, there has been a sustained
flight to interest-sensitive products from variable universal
life insurance (“VUL”). As a result, sales of VUL
products were down 41% from the prior year period.

Account values of $12.1 billion at
December 31, 2002 increased $0.7 billion or 6% from
December 31, 2001. The drivers of this increase were
positive cash flows, net of policyholder assessments, of
approximately $0.3 billion across all products during the
last twelve months, the transfer of the Legacy Life block of
business ($0.15 billion) from the Lincoln Retirement
segment in the first quarter of 2002 and interest earned on the



fixed products. These increases were partially
offset by the negative effect of the equity markets on VUL
account values.

Critical
Accounting Policy — DAC and PVIF

FAS 97 requires that acquisition costs for
universal life insurance (“UL”) policies and variable
universal life insurance (“VUL”) policies be amortized
over the lives of the contracts in relation to the incidence of
estimated gross profits, consistent with the treatment noted
previously for variable annuities. Factors affecting estimated
gross profits are surrender charges; investment, mortality net
of reinsurance ceded and expense margins; and realized
gains/losses on investments. For VUL policies, estimated gross
profits are affected by fee income as well. For the Life
Insurance segment, based on the current mix of life insurance
in-force on the books, the factors that have the most
significant impact on estimated gross profits are mortality (net
of reinsurance) and interest margins. Market movement, which has
the greatest impact on DAC amortization for the Retirement
segment relative to its variable annuity block of business, has
less impact on DAC amortization for the Life Insurance segment.
The Life Insurance segment earns fee income on its VUL product
line based on the ending daily VUL account values. This product
only makes up 14% of the segment’s total account values at
December 31, 2002.

On a quarterly basis, LNC reviews the assumptions
of its DAC amortization model and records a retrospective
adjustment to the amount expensed, (i.e. unlocks the DAC). On an
annual basis, LNC reviews and adjusts as necessary its
assumptions for prospective amortization of DAC, as well as its
other intangible asset, PVIF. Although the Life Insurance
segment is not as sensitive to the performance of the equity
markets as the Lincoln Retirement segment, the negative
performance of the equity markets resulted in negative
retrospective DAC unlocking in 2002 of $2.4 million. In
addition, negative DAC unlocking of $3.9 million related to
changes in various prospective assumptions occurred in 2002.

As illustrated in the discussion of the Life
Insurance segment’s results of operations above, the
segment earnings are not particularly sensitive to swings in the
equity markets. Refer to the First Quarter 2003 Guidance for
Estimated Effect of Equity Market Volatility section for
estimates of the effect of movements in the equity markets on
Life Insurance’s earnings.

Comparison of
2001 to 2000

The $16.2 million or 6% decrease in net
income in 2001 was due primarily to increased realized losses on
investments and derivative instruments of $26.3 million. The
Life Insurance segment also incurred two restructuring charges
in the second and fourth quarters of 2001 of $2.0 million
and $1.5 million, respectively. The $2.0 million
charge recorded in the second quarter of 2001 related to a
restructuring plan with the objective of eliminating duplicative
staff functions in the Schaumburg, Illinois operations of First
Penn-Pacific by transitioning them into the Annuities and Life
Insurance segment operations in Fort Wayne, Indiana and
Hartford, Connecticut, respectively, in order to reduce ongoing
operating costs. The $1.5 million charge recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2001 was for the reorganization and
consolidation of the life insurance operations in Hartford,
Connecticut related to the streamlining of underwriting and new
business processes and the completion of outsourcing of
administration of certain closed blocks of business.

Life Insurance experienced less favorable
mortality throughout 2001 after having a favorable year in 2000.
Partially contributing to the downturn in mortality experience
were the losses of $1.1 million recorded for the
September 11 terrorist attacks. The Life Insurance segment
also experienced lower earnings on investment partnerships. The
Life Insurance segment’s 2001 income was positively
impacted by growth in life insurance in-force from sales,
favorable persistency and lower general and administrative
expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased due to
expense reduction initiatives implemented in the second half of
2001. In 2000 and 2001, the Life Insurance segment did not
experience DAC unlocking that resulted in a significant impact
on earnings.

Sales as measured by first year premiums were
down overall in 2001 by $33.7 million or 5%. This decline was
due to a $39.8 million decrease in Corporate Owned Life
Insurance (“COLI”) sales. COLI sales, which



consist of very large cases, decreased from the
prior year due to two large cases accounting for
$42.5 million in first year premiums recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2000.

First year premiums on retail products increased
by $6.1 million or 1% between years. UL sales increased
$3.4 million or 1% between years. Although this overall
increase is modest, sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 were
$98 million, a 20% increase over the prior year quarter.
Sales rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter after a volatile
year for UL sales. VUL sales were up $9.8 million or 4%
between years. These results were encouraging given the
performance of the equity markets in 2001.

Partially offsetting the increased retail UL/ UVL
sales levels noted above was a decrease in term life sales of
$11.1 million or 26% between years. Term life sales for the
first six months of 2001 lagged the prior year period largely
due to strong first half of 2000 sales that were bolstered by
the impending enactment of the Valuation of Life Insurance Model
Regulation (“Regulation XXX”). Regulation XXX
required companies to increase reserves relative to certain term
life and permanent insurance policies with secondary guarantees
as of January 1, 2000. There was a rush of term business in
anticipation of the related price increases for implementation
of Regulation XXX with sales up in the first half of 2000
due to a back log of business at December 31, 1999. Term
sales increased incrementally each quarter in 2001 and for the
fourth quarter were 20% higher compared to the same quarter in
2000.

Account values increased $0.6 billion or 6%
to $11.4 billion at December 31, 2001 from
$10.8 billion at the prior year-end. Positive cash flows
for the year of $1.2 billion were the main contributor to
the increase between years. Cash flows in 2001 were flat
compared to the prior year. VUL account values were down between
years by $62 million due to market depreciation.

Product
Development

The Life Insurance segment offers a broad
portfolio of Life Insurance products. In addition to Term, the
segment offers three distinct permanent insurance product types:
Universal Life, Variable Universal Life and Interest Sensitive
Whole Life. Within these product types are wealth accumulation
and wealth transfer specific products, including single life and
survivorship versions of all three. Insurance riders such as
return of premium and long-term care benefit provisions are
available with certain products. .In addition, the segment
offers both UL and VUL versions of COLI. This allows the segment
to effectively align its portfolio of products with the primary
affluent market segments, and to also provide products that
perform under a variety of market conditions.

Given the economic environment of the recent
past, portfolio breadth has proven its value. The industry has
experienced a dramatic shift from variable to fixed products
over the last year, driven primarily by the equity market
decline and a flight to conservatism exacerbated by the events
of September 11, 2001. Over the last 12 months, the Life
segment’s mix of business has shifted dramatically from VUL
to UL, but the dollar decline in VUL sales has been more than
offset by the dollar increase in UL sales. Universal Life
accounted for 79% of total retail UL/ VUL sales in 2002 versus
56% of those sales in 2001. In times like these, when clients
have less tolerance for market risk, it is important to have a
competitive fixed Universal Life portfolio.

The Life Insurance segment has continued to
develop products that meet the changing needs of its target
affluent market. Throughout 2002, the segment revamped its
entire retail UL portfolio. In March 2002, it introduced a new
single life series of products with Lincoln UL

LPR

and
Lincoln UL

DB

. The Lapse Protection Rider
(“LPR”) product is an upgrade to the product
introduced in 2001 which offers the innovative lapse protection
rider, designed to provide flexibility and guaranteed death
benefit coverage – important features in today’s
market. The Death Benefit (“DB”) product is designed
to offer cost-efficient coverage for people less interested in
guarantees. In August of 2002, new survivorship versions of both
the LPR and DB products were also introduced. Overall, the
response to these new products has been very positive. In 2003,
the segment plans to continue to be aggressive in product
development.



Estate Tax
Reform

Estate tax reform was a major legislative debate
in 2002, which is expected to continue. Among a variety of
alternatives being considered is a temporary extension of the
one-year estate tax repeal that will occur in 2010 under current
law. If this occurs, inheritance taxes on a state-by-state basis
may be increased to offset the projected reduction in revenues
to state governments. More costly to both federal and state
governments would be a permanent repeal of estate taxes. The
outlook for permanent repeal remains highly uncertain,
particularly in light of increasing federal and state budgetary
concerns.

To date, the impact on LNC’s life insurance
sales of the recent changes in estate tax laws has not been
significant to overall sales for the Life Insurance segment.
Total survivorship sales as a percent of overall retail sales
dropped from 29% of the total first year premiums in 2001 to 22%
of the total in 2002. If estate taxes are permanently repealed,
LNC believes there will continue to be a demand for survivorship
products to meet a variety of tax, business and family needs.
The Life Insurance segment’s survivorship wealth transfer
products support a wide variety of financial planning needs such
as business succession and charitable giving, not just
management of estate tax exposure.

Guideline
AXXX

The Application of the Valuation of Life
Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“AXXX”) was
developed to clarify statutory reserve requirements for
particular policy designs under the NAIC Valuation of Life
Insurance Policies Model Regulation
(“Regulation XXX”). AXXX will increase statutory
reserves for universal life policies sold beginning in 2003 with
secondary guarantees using shadow accounts and for specified
premium guarantees that are prefunded. The secondary guarantee
promises to keep a policy in force as long as certain conditions
are met, regardless of whether the policy has any cash value.

Regardless of the value in the actual account
value, the policy will not lapse as long as the shadow account
is positive. A shadow account is a hypothetical account that
accumulates actual premium payments and interest less fees based
on the secondary guarantee assumptions. However, the shadow
account does not provide any cash value to the policyholder. All
companies offering secondary guarantees that allow prefunding
will be impacted to a greater or lesser degree depending on
product design. A prefunded policy is one where premiums are
paid earlier than is necessary to maintain the policy’s
benefits.

To reflect the financial requirements of AXXX,
Lincoln is repricing single life and survivorship products that
offer secondary guarantees using shadow accounts. The products
are scheduled to be released in the latter part of first quarter
2003. Lincoln also markets universal life products that do not
offer secondary guarantees, which will not be impacted by AXXX.
LNC believes that secondary guarantees are going to continue to
be critical to LNC’s target affluent market and that the
repriced versions of these products should remain competitive.
However, LNC may lose market share if competitors are slow to
replace their secondary guarantees for AXXX.

Split
Dollar

New regulations have set forth the IRS’
views regarding the tax treatment of split dollar funding
arrangements. Split dollar is a premium funding mechanism that
has been used for many years, with IRS approval, to provide life
insurance benefits to a firm’s key executives, or to
provide life insurance benefits to family members of closely
held firms, etc. In some cases, split dollar funding may not be
as attractive under the new IRS rules.

Further affecting some split dollar programs have
been accounting reforms under Sarbanes-Oxley, which prohibit
publicly traded companies from extending credit to their
directors or executives. However, most of the products sold by
LNC for use in split dollar arrangements are sold to closely
held companies, limited partnerships and family owned
businesses, not for publicly traded companies. Segment
management believes that given LNC’s target market, and the
fact that the amount of split dollar sales in relationship to
the level of total first year life premium sold is insignificant
to the Life Insurance segment, the impacts of these changes
should have minimal overall effect on sales.



COLI

A variety of legislative proposals are being
considered that would effect corporate owned life insurance. LNC
believes that life insurance remains a legitimate method of
corporate funding of anticipated future commitments as well as
protection from unpredictable events such as the loss of key
business executives. The Life Insurance segment continues to
approach COLI as an opportunistic market strategy. LNC’s
COLI product is only marketed to organizations for coverage of
officers and require the prospective permission of officers to
be covered under the COLI policy. Given the continuing
legislative debates over corporate owned life insurance LNC
management is not currently able to determine what impact this
environment will have on product design or sales. At
December 31, 2002, Life Insurance had $684 million of
account values for COLI, representing less than 6% of total
segment account values.

Outlook

The Life Insurance segment experienced strong
retail sales growth in 2002. Sales trends over the next year for
both UL and VUL products will likely continue to be heavily
influenced by the equity markets performance and the uncertainty
of the regulatory environment as well as the continued
competitive environment. There should continue to be a demand
among the affluent for sophisticated life products to meet a
variety of tax, business and family needs. LNC’s balanced
portfolio of products is nicely positioned to take advantage of
this demand. The Life Insurance segment expects to continue to
hold firm its operating fundamentals of: strong distribution
relationships, solid underwriting, mortality and investment
management and strong expense controls as it strives to be among
the top five generators of new premiums in the life insurance
industry. The Life Insurance segment’s earnings can be
expected to reflect some volatility due to short-term effects of
swings in mortality and morbidity.

Investment Management

The Investment Management segment, headquartered
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, offers a variety of asset
management services to retail and institutional clients located
throughout the United States and certain foreign countries. Its
product offerings include mutual funds and managed accounts. It
also provides investment management and account administration
services for variable annuity products, 401(k) plans,
“529” college savings plans, pension, endowment, and
trust and other institutional accounts. The primary operating
companies within this segment are the subsidiaries of Delaware
Management Holdings, Inc. (“Delaware”). Retail
products are primarily marketed by LFD and Delaware
Distributors, L.P. through financial intermediaries including
LFA. Institutional products, including large case 401(k) plans,
are marketed by a separate sales force within Delaware working
closely with pension consultants.

Diversity of investment styles, as well as
diversity of clients served, are prudent ways to manage risk in
varying market environments. Delaware, historically known for a
conservative, “value” equity investment style has now
evolved into an investment manager with strong and diversified
offerings across all major asset classes including value and
growth equity investment styles; high-grade, high-yield and
municipal fixed income investment styles; balanced and
quantitative investment styles; and international and global
equity and fixed income investment styles.



Results of
Operations:

The Investment Management
segment’s financial results were as follows:

(1)

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change relates to
    the second quarter 2001 adoption of EITF 99-20.

Comparison of
2002 to 2001

Net income for 2002 increased $13.8 million
or 117% over 2001. Excluding the effect of goodwill amortization
in 2001, net income decreased $2.4 million or 9% in 2002.
The decrease in income is primarily a result of declines in the
equity markets reducing retail and institutional assets under
management and revenues. Offsetting the negative effect of the
markets on revenues has been a reduction in expenses of
$19.2 million, excluding the reduction in expenses from the
change in accounting for goodwill amortization and restructuring
charges. This improvement in expenses is a result of cost
containment efforts, the effect of the equity market decline on
variable expenses, $1.7 million reduction in amortization
of other intangible assets resulting from certain intangibles
being fully amortized in the second quarter of 2001 and $4.2
million for the release of accrued compensation resulting from
the fourth quarter 2002 resignation of the segment’s CEO.
In addition to lower expenses, positive net cash flows in 2002
partially offset the negative effect of the equity markets on
assets under management and revenues.

Net income for 2002 included releases of
$0.3 million related to restructuring charges reported in
the fourth quarter of 2000 to combine the investment management
operations for fixed income products of Lincoln Investment
Management and Delaware in Philadelphia.

Critical
Accounting Policy — Equity Market
Sensitivity

As illustrated in the discussion of the
Investment Management segment’s results of operations
above, the segment’s earnings are sensitive to swings in
the equity markets. Refer to the First Quarter 2003 Guidance for
Estimated Effect of Equity Market Volatility section for
estimates of the effect of movements in the equity markets on
Investment Management’s earnings.

Critical
Accounting Policy — Deferred Dealer Commission
Asset

The Investment Management segment has a deferred
dealer commission asset of approximately $53 million as of
December 31, 2002 relating to upfront sales commissions
paid to brokers for the sale of “Class B” shares
of Delaware Investments retail mutual funds. The asset is
amortized over the estimated period of time that it is expected
to be realized or recovered from future cash flows in the form
of asset-based distribution (“12b-1”) fees from the
mutual funds or contingent deferred sales charges
(“CDSCs”) from shareholders who redeem shares during
the CDSC period. The estimate of future cash flows from these
sources has been negatively impacted by the continued declines
in the equity markets.



In accordance with SFAS 144 “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, should
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from 12b-1 fees and
CDSC’s drop below the carrying value of the deferred dealer
commission asset, then an impairment write-down would be
required to be recognized. In that event, the amount of the
impairment write-down would be computed by comparing the
carrying value of the deferred dealer commission asset to the
discounted value of the future 12b-1 and CDSC cash flows. As of
December 31, 2002, the estimated undiscounted future 12b-1
and CDSC cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the deferred
dealer commission asset.

However, continued declines in the financial
markets or Net Asset Values (“NAVs”) of the underlying
retail mutual funds may trigger the recognition of a write-down
of the deferred dealer commission asset. For instance, a review
of the deferred dealer commission asset was performed as of
March 10, 2003. Based on information currently available,
it is estimated that a decline of approximately 3% in the equity
markets from March 10, 2003 levels may trigger a loss,
which would range from approximately $7.4 million to
$11.4 million after-tax with the application of assumed
discount rates ranging between 10% to 18% for purposes of
measuring the fair value of the deferred dealer commission
asset. The estimated balance of the deferred dealer commission
asset as of March 10, 2003 was approximately
$50 million.

The determination of any impairment of the
deferred dealer commission asset is performed at quarter end
when complete information is available. The determination of any
impairment includes both the fixed income and equity mutual
funds. Once an impairment loss is recognized, no write-up of the
value of the deferred dealer commission asset is permitted even
if there are subsequent increases in the NAVs of the underlying
retail mutual funds from favorable financial markets.

Comparison of
2001 to 2000

The decreases in net income of $25.2 million
or 68% in 2001 were primarily attributable to lower investment
advisory fees and to a lesser extent lower other revenue
partially offset by lower expenses. Revenue decreased as a
result of a decrease in external assets under management,
reduced distribution, shareholder servicing and investment
accounting revenue associated with lower retail mutual fund
sales and lower assets under management.

The primary driver of the decrease in external
assets under management between years was net cash outflows of
$7.2 billion in 2000 that caused the 2001 beginning of year
external assets under management to be much lower than the prior
year beginning balance and to a lesser extent, market
depreciation of $4.3 billion. Total net outflows in 2001 of
$0.6 billion also had a slight negative impact on
investment advisory fees.

The Investment Management segment made
significant investments in 2000 and 2001 in upgrading talent and
revamping investment processes; however, effective expense
management resulted in an overall decrease in expenses. Expenses
decreased by $10.9 million (pre-tax) or 3% in 2001. This
decrease was primarily due to the absence of significant
severance expenses incurred during 2000, lower amortization
expense associated with other intangible assets and effective
management of other expenses. Certain other intangible assets
capitalized as part of LNC’s acquisition of Delaware
Management Holdings, Inc. in 1995 had six-year lives and were
fully amortized in April of 2001. In addition, the segment had
lower incentive compensation expense accruals due primarily to
the declining financial results between years. Partially
offsetting the decreased expenses noted above was higher
amortization of deferred broker commissions due to an increase
in the deferred broker commission asset and expenses incurred
during 2001 to close and/or merge a number of mutual funds.

The change in net income for 2001 compared to
2000 also included the impact of restructuring charges. The
Investment Management segment incurred a restructuring charge in
the fourth quarter of 2001 of $0.4 million related to the
consolidation of the Boston, Massachusetts investment and
marketing office with the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania investment
and marketing operations in order to eliminate redundant
facilities and functions within this business segment. In 2000,
the Investment Management segment incurred two restructuring
charges of $2.7 million and $2.5 million in the second
and fourth quarters, respectively. The objectives of the
$2.7 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2000
were to combine the structured product teams of Delaware and
Vantage in Philadelphia and to consolidate the back office
operations of



Vantage into Delaware, in order to reduce ongoing
operating costs and to eliminate redundant facilities within
this business segment. The objectives of the $2.5 million
charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 were to combine
the investment management operations for fixed income products
of Lincoln Investment Management and Delaware in Philadelphia,
in order to reduce ongoing operating costs and eliminate
redundant facilities within this business segment. In addition,
in 2000 there were reversals totaling $0.6 million related
to the Lynch & Mayer restructuring charge originally
recorded in 1999 and the Vantage restructuring charge recorded
in 2000. For further discussion of these restructuring plans
refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

Assets Under
Management and Client Net Flows(1)

The Investment Management segment’s assets
under management were as follows:

The Investment Management segment’s net
flows were as follows:



(1)

Retail assets under management and net flows for
    2000 and 2001 have been restated to include assets under
    administration by the segment. Previously, these assets were
    excluded as the investments are managed by third parties. Assets
    under administration are now included so that assets under
    management includes all assets for which the segment receives
    asset based revenues. The restatements increased assets under
    management by $0.5 billion at both December 31, 2001 and
    December 31, 2000 and net retail flows increased by
    $81 million and $18 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Assets under management increased
$1.1 billion to $87.6 billion at the end of 2002. The
increase was the result of a $3.0 billion increase in
insurance assets (i.e. primarily general account assets of
LNC’s insurance subsidiaries). In addition, institutional
assets under management increased $0.7 billion as positive
net inflows of $2.1 billion offset the reduction in assets
of $1.4 billion resulting from the negative performance of the
equity markets. Retail assets under management decreased
$2.6 billion as the equity markets reduced assets by
$3.4 billion, more than offsetting the $0.8 billion
positive net flows.

The Investment Management segment’s net
flows turned positive for 2002, a significant improvement over
the net outflows in prior years. Total net flows improved
$3.5 billion over 2001. The improvement in net flows in
2002 was the result of a $1.4 billion increase in
institutional inflows and improvement in retention of
institutional assets. In addition, higher retail sales offset
increased redemptions and transfers.

Positive investment performance has been a key
driver of the improvement in net flows. On the institutional
side, for the year ended December 31, 2002, 4 of the 8
largest product composites met or outperformed their respective
indices and these 4 composites accounted for 74% of
institutional assets under management. However, this relative
performance is below the results experienced for the year ended
December 31, 2001, in which 6 of the 8 largest composites
outperformed their respective indices. On the retail side, for
the year ended December 31, 2002, 17 of 25 or 68% of the
largest retail funds in Delaware Investments Family of Funds
(the Delaware Investments Family of Funds does not include
mutual funds managed by Delaware for certain LNC affiliates)
performed in the top half of their respective Lipper universes;
76% of the 25 largest retail funds performed in the top half of
their respective Lipper universes for the year ended
December 31, 2001. These 17 funds represented 63% of assets
under management of the largest 25 retail funds at
December 31, 2002. In addition, Delaware had 15 funds
labeled Lipper Leaders for “Consistent Return,” 8
funds named Lipper Leaders for “Capital Preservation,”
10 funds labeled Lipper Leaders for “Total Return,” 7
funds labeled Lipper Leaders for “Expense” and 22
funds labeled Lipper Leaders for “Tax Efficiency.” For
the year, 41 of Delaware’s 52 retail funds have been
labeled a Lipper Leader in at least one category and 17 funds
have been selected in multiple categories.

Retail sales for 2002 were a record
$5.7 billion, up $2.0 billion or 54% over 2001. The
growth in retail sales was driven by increased sales of managed
account business. Managed account deposits in 2002 more than
doubled deposits in 2001, with deposits of $1.2 billion in
2002 compared to $0.5 billion in 2001. A portion of the
sales increase in managed accounts was a result of events
affecting key competitors (a group departure of investment
professionals from one firm and a second firm temporarily
closing for new business).

Sales of Delaware’s mutual funds by LFA
continued to decline during 2002 as sales through LFA
represented approximately 4% and 5% of LFA’s total mutual
fund sales in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sales of mutual
funds, managed accounts, 401(k) products and “529”
plans through LFD, the internal wholesaling arm for distribution
of Delaware’s investment products increased 32% in 2002
relative to 2001. LFD was organized at the end of 2000 and was
in the ramp up stage throughout 2001. Delaware is working
closely with both LFA and LFD to increase sales through improved
communication, focusing on selected funds and working with the
newly formed research teams to ensure optimum positioning of
competitive Delaware products. Delaware was awarded program
management and certain investment advisory services for the
“529” college savings plans for the state of Hawaii
and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during 2001. Services
commenced in mid-2002 for the “529” plans. The
persistence of poor equity markets, combined with a more crowded
“529” marketplace, has resulted in lower than
anticipated sales; however, these programs provide Delaware with
an opportunity to attract significant long-term assets under
management. Although “529”



programs should have a favorable impact on retail
sales, positive earnings impact is not expected to occur until
at least 2005 because of significant start-up and distribution
costs.

Outlook

In October 2002, the President and CEO of
Delaware, Charles E. Haldeman, Jr. announced his
resignation. In January 2003, Jude T. Driscoll, Executive
Vice-President and Head of Fixed Income for Delaware, was named
President and CEO. LNC believes that a strong team of investment
and research professionals exists at Delaware that continues to
be committed to a team approach to research and investment
management. Delaware continues to focus on improving investment
performance, attracting and retaining client assets and/or
funds, managing expenses and ultimately improving profitability.
The Investment Management segment has made progress on these
initiatives, and will continue to focus on sustaining and
improving those results.

Lincoln UK

Lincoln UK is headquartered in Barnwood,
Gloucester, England, and is licensed to do business throughout
the United Kingdom (“UK”). Although Lincoln UK
transferred its sales force to Inter-Alliance Group PLC in the
third quarter of 2000, it continues to manage, administer and
accept new deposits on its current block of business and accept
new business for certain products. Lincoln UK’s
product portfolio principally consists of unit-linked life and
pension products, which are similar to variable life and annuity
products sold in the U.S.

Result of Operations:

Lincoln UK’s financial
results, account values, in-force and exchange rates were as
follows:

(1)

Income (loss) from operations and net income
    (loss) for 1999 include a charge of $126.1 million
    ($194.0 million pre-tax) for a change in estimate of the
    cost of settling pension misselling liabilities and 1999 also
    includes a tax benefit of $42.1 million relating to the
    decision to explore exiting the UK insurance market.

Comparison of
2002 to 2001

The $28.9 million or 42% decrease in net
income in 2002 was primarily due to the decline in the UK equity
markets. The FSTE 100 index declined 24% in 2002 compared
to a 16% decline in 2001. The decline in the equity markets
reduced assets in equity-linked accounts resulting in lower fee
income. The equity market



decline also resulted in increased amortization
from retrospective unlocking of DAC and PVIF assets and the
liability, deferred front-end loads revenue (“DFEL”).
There was negative unlocking of $22.8 million in 2002
compared to negative unlocking of $8.4 million in 2001. As
required under FAS 97, acquisition costs for unit-linked
contracts are amortized over the lives of the contracts in
relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits. Estimated
gross profits on unit-linked contracts vary based on surrenders,
fee income, expenses and realized gains/losses on investments.
The amortization is adjusted retrospectively when estimates of
current or future gross profits to be realized from unit-linked
contracts are revised. Because market movement has such a
significant impact on fee income, estimated future profits will
go up or down accordingly. On a quarterly basis, Lincoln UK
reviews the assumptions of its DAC amortization model and
records a retrospective adjustment to the amount expensed, (i.e.
unlocks the DAC). On an annual basis, Lincoln UK reviews
and adjusts as necessary its assumptions for prospective
amortization of DAC, PVIF and DFEL.

In 2001, Lincoln UK consolidated its home
office operations into the Barnwood office. In 2002,
Lincoln UK sold its former Uxbridge home office and
recognized a realized gain on the transaction of
$5.5 million ($7.9 million pre-tax) which is included
in realized gain on investments. Excluding this gain,
Lincoln UK’s realized gains (losses) decreased
$12.9 million from 2001. The impact of realized gain
(losses) in both years was a result of sales relating to
the realignment of the investment portfolio in order to better
match invested assets with the liabilities they support.

Net income for 2002 included releases of
$1.7 million related to restructuring charges reported in
2000 for the restructuring plan to exit all direct sales and
sales support operations and to consolidate the Uxbridge home
office with the Barnwood home office.

Critical
Accounting Policy – Equity Market Sensitivity

As illustrated in the discussion of the
Lincoln UK segment’s results of operations above, the
segment earnings are sensitive to swings in the equity markets.
Refer to the First Quarter 2003 Guidance for Estimated Effect of
Equity Market Volatility on Fee Income, DAC and GMDB section for
estimates of the effect of movements in the equity markets on
Lincoln UK’s earnings.

Comparison of
2001 to 2000

The increase in net income of $82.1 million
in 2001 was due primarily to the absence of restructuring
charges of $76.5 million recorded in the third and fourth
quarters of 2000 as discussed above. This restructuring plan
resulted from LNC’s decisions to cease writing new business
in the UK through its sales force and transfer of the sales
force to Inter-Alliance Group PLC. In addition, Lincoln UK
had an increase in realized gains on investments of
$6.4 million between years. The gains reported in 2001
relate to the realignment of the investment portfolio to better
match invested assets with the liabilities they support.

Outsourcing
Agreement

In the third quarter 2002, Lincoln UK agreed
to outsource its customer service and policy administration
function to the Capita Group, Plc (“Capita”). The
agreement involved the transfer of approximately 500 employees
to Capita. The purpose of the transaction was to reduce the
operational risk and variability of future costs associated with
administering the business by taking advantage of Capita’s
proven expertise in providing outsourcing solutions to a variety
of industries including general insurance companies.

Exchange
Rates

LNC’s subsidiary in the UK has its balance
sheets and income statements translated at the current spot
exchange rate as of the year end and average spot exchange rate
for the year, respectively. From time to time, LNC will hedge
its exposure to foreign currency as it relates to its net
investment in Lincoln UK.



Outlook

During 2003, Lincoln UK will continue to
work to resolve all past misselling exposures while focusing on
retaining and managing its current block of business and
maximizing earnings through effective expense management.

Other Operations

Activity that is not included in the major
business segments is reported in “Other Operations.”
“Other Operations” includes operations not directly
related to the business segments and unallocated corporate items
(i.e., corporate investment income, interest expense on
corporate debt, unallocated overhead expenses, and the
operations of LFA and LFD.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2001, LNC had a
Reinsurance segment (“Lincoln Re”). LNC’s
reinsurance business was acquired by Swiss Re in December
2001. As the majority of the business acquired by Swiss Re
was via indemnity reinsurance agreements, LNC is not relieved of
its legal liability to the ceding companies for this business.
This means that the liabilities and obligations associated with
the reinsured contracts remain on the consolidated balance
sheets of LNC with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from
Swiss Re. In addition, the gain resulting from the
indemnity reinsurance portion of the transaction was deferred
and is being amortized into earnings at the rate that earnings
on the reinsured business are expected to emerge, over a period
of 15 years. The ongoing management of the indemnity
reinsurance contracts and the reporting of the deferred gain
will be within LNC’s Other Operations. Given the lengthy
period of time over which LNC will continue to amortize the
deferred gain, and the fact that related assets and liabilities
will continue to be reported on LNC’s financial statements,
the historical results for the Reinsurance segment prior to the
close of the transaction with Swiss Re will not be
reflected in discontinued operations, but as a separate line in
Other Operations. The results for 2001 included eleven months of
Reinsurance segment operations through the period ended
November 30, 2001.



Results of
Operations:

Other Operations’
financial results were as follows:

(1)

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes relates
    to the transition adjustment of $(0.5) million recorded in the
    first quarter of 2001 upon adoption of FAS No. 133 and the
    adjustment of $(2.2) million recorded in the second quarter of
    2001 upon adoption of EITF 99-20.

Comparison of
2002 to 2001

The net loss in 2002 was a $248.0 million
higher compared to net income in 2001. The net loss includes
$199.1 million related to charges required by FAS 113
for increases in personal accident and disability income
reserves for the business sold through indemnity reinsurance to
Swiss Re. Included in the charge is $0.6 million of
amortization related to the reserve increases and the settlement
with Swiss Re on disputed matters. In addition, the
amortization of deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance increased
$36.0 million due to a full year’s amortization in 2002
compared to one month’s amortization in 2001.

Net income for 2001, included $128.8 million
of income from the former Reinsurance segment. In 2002, LNC
reported a gain of $21.7 million on the sale of its
investment (included in realized gains on investments) in an
international marketing company associated with LNC’s
former Reinsurance segment. Offsetting this gain was an
adjustment in 2002 of $9.4 million to the gain on sale of
reinsurance subsidiaries sold in 2001. The adjustment related
primarily to the true-up of estimated taxes associated with the
sale.

LNC Financing had a positive variance of
$34.9 million from 2001. In 2002, LNC Financing
included investment income of $19.6 million from the
proceeds of the sale of LNC’s reinsurance business to
Swiss Re.



In addition to the investment income, there was a
decrease in long-term debt expense associated with various
long-term financing activities that occurred in the second half
of 2001 and third quarter of 2002 as described in the Liquidity
and Cash Flow section within Review of Consolidated Financial
Conditions. In addition, short-term borrowing costs were lower
due to lower interest rates and lower daily average borrowings
under the commercial paper program in the U.K. The
Lincoln UK segment has experienced increased cash flow from
operations over the last year, which was used in part to
eliminate its outstanding commercial paper balance during 2002.

Other Corporate had income of $5.8 million
in 2002, an improvement of $24.0 million compared to 2001.
Included in the 2001 loss was a restructuring charge of
$15.8 million to consolidate operations and reduce excess
space in LNC’s Fort Wayne, Indiana operations resulting
from LNC’s divestiture of its reinsurance operations.

LFA had an increase in net loss of
$11.7 million compared to 2001. Included in LFA’s
expenses are the effects of changes in the measurement of
LFA’s liability for deferred compensation due to changes in
fair value primarily resulting from changes in the equity
markets. The declines in the equity markets during 2002, reduced
LFA’s liability for deferred compensation and increased
income by $6.4 million. However, in the fourth quarter 2001, LNC
invested in a variable annuity contract to partially offset the
impact on net income of equity market volatility associated with
the liability for deferred compensation. Due to the fall of the
equity markets in 2002, the annuity value decreased resulting in
a loss of $8.3 million. In addition, in 2002 the Fringe
Benefit operation (“FBD”) was moved from LFA to the
Retirement segment. In 2001, FBD had a loss of $2.2 million
which was included in LFA’s results. Excluding the net
effect of the annuity and the deferred compensation liability
and FBD’s income in 2001, LFA’s net loss was
$25.6 million and $18.5 million in 2002 and 2001,
respectively, an increase of $7.1 million between years.
LFA sales during the fourth quarter 2002 did not reflect the
typical seasonal fourth quarter increase over the prior three
quarters of the year as had been seen during the fourth quarter
of the previous four years. This deviation from the prior trend
in sales resulted in a decrease in revenues for the year. In
2003, LFA expects to focus on its growth strategy to increase
its financial planner base in order to expand sales while
employing effective expense management.

LFD, LNC’s wholesaling distribution arm,
experienced an improvement in net losses of $0.5 million in
2002. However, included in LFD’s 2002 net income were
expenses of $5.0 million resulting from a decision to
expense previously deferred costs related to specific
initiatives to expand life insurance sales. Excluding this
expense, LFD’s net losses improved as a result of a
combination of increased sales in all of its product categories
including life insurance, annuity and investment products and a
reduction in fixed operating costs primarily due to lower
expenses following two restructurings that occurred in 2001 and
ongoing disciplined expense management. LFD incurred expenses of
$3.7 million in 2001 for the restructuring activities. The
objectives of LFD restructuring charges were to reorganize the
life wholesaling function within the independent planner
distribution channel; consolidate retirement wholesaling
territories; streamline the marketing and communications
functions in LFD; combine channel oversight; position LFD to
take better advantage of ongoing “marketplace
consolidation” and to expand the customer base of
wholesalers in certain non-productive territories. LFD’s
on-going strategy is to develop existing strategic alliances
across all distribution channels. However, given the continued
uncertainty of the equity markets and interest rate environment,
LNC is cautious about sales expectations for 2003.

Critical
Accounting Policy — Personal Accident & Disability
Income Reserves

Refer to the Acquisition and Divestiture section
for discussion of the impact on income for changes in reserves
for the personal accident and disability income sold to
Swiss Re through indemnity reinsurance.

Comparison of
2001 to 2000

Net income increased $17.4 million to
$7.2 million in 2002. Net income for 2001 included the
impact of three restructuring charges totaling
$19.5 million: two charges were recorded related to LFD
totaling $3.7 million and the other charge was for
$15.8 million noted above in Other Corporate. Net income
for 2001 also included the impact of a $15.0 million gain
on sale of reinsurance subsidiaries.



The loss in Financing decreased $7.0 million
between years primarily due to lower short-term borrowing costs
resulting from the ten Fed rate cuts that occurred in 2001 and
lower long-term debt costs. The decrease in long-term debt costs
resulted from several corporate finance activities in 2001 as
described in the Liquidity and Cash Flow section of the Review
of Consolidated Financial Conditions.

Other Corporate experienced a negative variance
of $3.1 million between years. Included in the 2001 loss
was the restructuring charge noted above. In 2000, there were
losses of $2.6 million associated with litigation items and
a $2.4 million loss related to LNC’s equity investment in
AnnuityNet. In addition, there was $8.6 million in
incentive compensation expense in 2000 resulting from the
achievement of the three-year long-term incentive compensation
goals.

The Reinsurance line, which includes the
historical earnings of the former Reinsurance segment had an
increase in income of $5.6 million in 2001. The 2001
results, however, only represents eleven months of earnings
through November 30, 2001.

The Amortization of Deferred Gain line includes
the amortization of the deferred gain on the indemnity
reinsurance portion of the transaction with Swiss Re for
December ($5.0 million) along with the recognition of
accelerated amortization of the deferred gain on Canadian
reinsurance business that was novated to Swiss Re after
December 7, 2001 ($7.9 million), but prior to
December 31, 2001. In accordance with FAS 113, the
gain associated with the indemnity reinsurance portion of the
transaction with Swiss Re was recorded as a deferred gain
and is being amortized into earnings over a period of
15 years. Upon novation (transfer of the legal liability),
generally accepted accounting principles provide for immediate
recognition in earnings of the deferred gain related to the
novated business.

LFA had an increased net loss of
$4.2 million between years due primarily to a decrease in
sales revenue. LFA, a fee-based investment planning firm and
broker/ dealer, experienced a decrease in sales across all
product lines: annuities, life insurance and other investment
products. The downturn in the equity markets caused a difficult
sales environment for broker/ dealers. Sales in the fourth
quarter of 2001 rebounded from the lower levels experienced in
the first three quarters of 2001 and contributed to positive
earnings for the quarter which reduced the loss for the year.
This fourth quarter 2001 increase in sales was consistent with
the trend experienced over the prior three years and can be
explained as a seasonal improvement related to the year-end
increase in tax planning and other related activities. In
addition, in 2001, the events of September 11 derailed
sales in the third quarter which created increased demand in the
fourth quarter. In addition to lower revenues, LFA had an
increase in overall expenses in 2001 as a result of increased
salaries and other general and administrative expenses partially
offset by reduced commissions and other volume related expenses.

LFD had an increased loss of $15.9 million
between years due to decreased sales revenue and increased
expenses, including the restructuring charge in 2001 noted
above. LFD experienced slightly lower retail sales in 2001, and
revenue decreased as a result of changes in the mix of business.
In addition, LFD had lower sales of corporate owned life
insurance as previously discussed in the Life Insurance
segment’s result of operations. Retail sales were bolstered
by strong second half sales of the StepFive® Fixed Annuity,
Lincoln ChoicePlus

sm

Variable Annuity product line
and the MoneyGuard universal life product which includes a
long-term care benefit. Mutual fund sales, however, were weak
throughout the year due primarily to the poor performance of the
equity markets. In addition, LFD’s wholesaling force was
not at full strength until the end of 2001. LFD had higher
expenses primarily as a result of its investment in new
wholesalers during 2001 partially offset by the positive impact
on expenses of the two restructuring plans implemented in 2001,
as well as other targeted expense reduction activities. LFD
started with 221 wholesalers at the beginning of 2001 and had
241 at December 31, 2001.

Litigation

During the first quarter of 2000, the appellate
court upheld LNC’s position in litigation relating to the
1992 sale of the Employee Life-Health Benefit business segment.
As a result of this favorable decision, LNC’s 2000 earnings
increased by approximately $11.2 million
($17.2 million pre-tax).



In 2001, Lincoln National Life Insurance Company
(“LNL’) concluded the settlement of all class action
lawsuits alleging fraud in the sale of LNL non-variable
universal life and participating whole life policies issued
between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1998. Since
2001, LNL has reached settlements with a substantial number of
the owners of policies that opted out of the class action
settlement. LNL continues to defend a small number of opt out
claims and lawsuits. While there is continuing uncertainty about
the ultimate costs of settling the remaining opt out cases, it
is management’s opinion that established reserves are
adequate and future developments will not materially affect the
consolidated financial position of LNC.

LNC and LNL have pursued claims with their
liability insurance carriers for reimbursement of certain costs
incurred in connection with the class action settlement and the
settlement of claims and litigation brought by owners that opted
out of the class action settlement. During the fourth quarter of
2002, LNC and LNL settled their claims against three liability
carriers on a favorable basis. LNC and LNL continue to pursue
similar claims against a fourth liability insurance carrier.

In December 2000, LNC received a $43 million
(pre-tax) cash payment in exchange for agreeing to modify
certain non-compete terms included in an acquisition completed
by LNC prior to 1999. In LNC’s purchase accounting for this
acquisition, the non-compete terms of the acquisition agreement
were believed to have only negligible value and there was no
reasonable basis for estimating the additional business and
profits, if any, that might result from these non-compete terms.
Under these facts and circumstances, LNC concluded that no
separately identifiable intangible asset should be recorded for
the non-compete terms. However, events in 2000 resulted in a
substantial increase in the value of these non-compete terms,
culminating with the receipt of the $43 million payment.
LNC does not believe that the forfeiture of its remaining
non-compete rights and benefits, which would have otherwise
expired in 2001, diminishes the value of goodwill recorded in
the acquisition. As a result, LNC recorded the
$28.0 million ($43 million pre-tax) payment in fourth
quarter 2000 net income.

Consolidated Investments

The consolidated assets under management
including consolidated investments and assets held in separate
accounts on the balance sheet, and external assets under
management classified by investment advisor, mean invested
assets, net investment income and investment yield are as
follows:

(1)

See Investment Management segment data for
    additional detail.

(2)

Includes tax-exempt income.

Investment Objective:

Invested assets are an integral part
of the Lincoln Retirement, Life Insurance and Lincoln UK
segments’ operations. For discussion of external assets
under management, i.e. retail and



institutional assets, see the Investment
Management segment discussion. LNC follows a balanced approach
of investment for both current income and prudent risk
management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current
income to meet LNC’s obligations. This approach requires
the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class
utilized, while still meeting the income objectives of LNC. This
approach also permits LNC to be more effective in its
asset-liability management, since decisions can be made based
upon both the economic and current investment income
considerations affecting assets and liabilities.

Investment Portfolio Composition and
Diversification:

Fundamental to
LNC’s investment policy is diversification across asset
classes. LNC’s investment portfolio, excluding cash and
invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities;
mortgage loans on real estate; real estate either wholly owned
or in joint ventures and other long-term investments. LNC
purchases investments for its segmented portfolios that have
yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account
the liabilities of the products being supported. The dominant
investments held are fixed maturity securities, which represent
approximately 82% the investment portfolio. The total investment
portfolio increased $3.9 billion in 2002 and
$744 million in 2001. The increase in 2002 was due to the
purchase of investments from cash flow generated by the business
units, positive net flows for fixed annuity portfolios and
market appreciation of fixed maturity securities. The increase
in 2001 was due to the purchase of investments from cash flow
generated by the business units, positive net flows for fixed
annuity portfolios and market appreciation of fixed maturity
securities due to the significant decline in interest rates
during 2001.

Securities Available-for-Sale:

LNC’s entire fixed maturity and
equity securities portfolio is classified as
“available-for-sale” and is carried at fair value on
its balance sheet. Because the general intent of the
“available-for-sale” accounting rules is to reflect
shareholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were
actually recognized, it is necessary for LNC to consider all
related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a
hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such
related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the
balances of deferred acquisition costs, policyholder commitments
and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances
are charged or credited directly to shareholders’ equity as
part of LNC’s “available-for-sale” accounting.
For instance, deferred acquisition costs are adjusted upon the
recognition of unrealized gains or losses since the amortization
of deferred acquisition costs is based upon an assumed emergence
of gross profits on certain insurance business. In a similar
manner, adjustments to the balances of policyholder reserves or
commitments are made because LNC has either a contractual
obligation or has a consistent historical practice of making
allocations of investment gains or losses to certain
policyholders. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted,
since unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes
currently paid. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements for details of the gross unrealized gains and losses
as of December 31, 2002.

Mortgaged-Backed Securities:

LNC’s fixed maturity securities
available-for-sale include mortgage-backed securities. The
mortgage-backed securities included in LNC’s investment
portfolio are subject to risks associated with variable
prepayments. This may result in these securities having a
different actual cash flow and maturity than expected at the
time of purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater
than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than
expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss. Those
securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay
faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a
gain. In addition, LNC may incur reinvestment risks if market
yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities.
Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite
impact. LNC may incur disinvestment risks if market yields are
higher than the book yields earned on the securities and LNC is
forced to sell the securities. The degree to which a security is
susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by
1) the difference between its amortized cost and par,
2) the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages
backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate
environment and 3) the repayment priority of the securities
in the overall securitization structure.

LNC limits the extent of its risk on
mortgage-backed securities by prudently limiting exposure to the
asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities
with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing
securities backed by stable collateral, and by concentrating on
securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure. Such
securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield (but
higher liquidity) than higher-risk mortgage-backed securities.
At selected times, higher-risk securities may be purchased if
they do



not compromise the safety of the general
portfolio. At December 31, 2002, LNC did not have a
significant amount of higher-risk mortgage-backed securities.
There are negligible default risks in the mortgage-backed
securities portfolio as a whole as the vast majority of the
assets are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored
entities or are supported in the securitization structure by
junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment
grade status. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional detail about the underlying collateral.

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate and Real Estate:

As of December 31, 2002, mortgage
loans on real estate and investments in real estate represented
10.5% and 0.7% of the total investment portfolio. As of
December 31, 2002, the underlying properties supporting the
mortgage loans on real estate consisted of 36.8% in commercial
office buildings, 23.3% in retail stores, 18.1% in industrial
buildings, 10.3% in apartments, 7.7% in hotels/motels and 3.8%
in other. In addition to the dispersion by property type, the
mortgage loan portfolio is geographically diversified throughout
the United States. However, mortgage loans on real estate in
California and Texas accounted for approximately 28% of the
total carrying value of mortgage loans at December 31, 2002.

All mortgage loans that are impaired have an
established allowance for credit loss. Changing economic
conditions impact LNC’s valuation of mortgage loans.
Increasing vacancies, declining rents and the like are
incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that LNC
performs for monitored loans and may contribute to the
establishment of (or an increase in) an allowance for credit
losses. In addition, LNC recently completed a detailed review of
its entire hotel mortgage loan portfolio in light of the
downturn in that sector and has done similar analysis for its
portfolio of anchored retail mortgage loans. LNC also monitors
and evaluates office mortgage loan exposures to troubled sectors
such as telecom. Where warranted, LNC has established or
increased loss reserves based upon this analysis. Impaired
mortgage loans as a percentage of total mortgage loans has
deteriorated over the last year as a result of increased credit
losses in the sectors noted above. This percentage was 1.7%,
0.6%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1.1%, 1.9% and 3.9% as of
December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional detail regarding impaired mortgage
loans.

LNC completed securitizations of commercial
mortgage loans in both the fourth quarter of 2000 and the fourth
quarter of 2001. In each securitization, the loans were
transferred to a trust held in a “qualified” special
purpose entity (“SPE”), which is therefore not
consolidated into LNC. In the first securitization, the loans
had a fair value of $186.0 million and a carrying value of
$185.7 million. LNC retained a 6.3% interest in the
securitized assets. LNC received $172.7 million from the
trust for the sale of the senior trust certificates representing
the other 93.7% beneficial interest. A realized gain of
$0.4 million pre-tax was recorded on this sale. A recourse
liability was not recorded since LNC is not obligated to
repurchase any loans from the trust that may later become
delinquent. Cash flows received during 2002, 2001 and 2000 from
interests retained in the trust were $2.6 million,
$2.6 million and $0.4, respectively.

In the second securitization completed in 2001,
the loans had a fair value of $209.7 million and a carrying
value of $198.1 million. LNC received $209.7 million
from the trust for the sale of the loans. A recourse liability
was not recorded since LNC is not obligated to repurchase any
loans from the trust that may later become delinquent. Servicing
fees of $0.03 million were received in 2001 and
$0.2 million were received in 2002. The transaction was
hedged with total return swaps to lock in the value of the
loans. LNC recorded a loss on the hedge of $10.1 million
pre-tax and a realized gain on the sale of $11.6 million
pre-tax resulting in a net gain of $1.5 million pre-tax.
LNC did not initially retain an interest in the securitized
assets; however, LNC later invested $14.3 million of its
general account assets in the certificates issued by the trust.
This investment is included in fixed maturity securities on the
balance sheet.

Limited Partnership Investments:

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
there were $294.2 million and $329.5 million,
respectively, of limited partnership investments included in
consolidated investments. These include investments in
approximately 50 different partnerships that allow LNC to gain
exposure to a broadly diversified portfolio of asset classes
such as venture capital, hedge funds, and oil and gas. They are
generally fairly large partnerships with several third party
partners. These partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet
financing to LNC. Select partnerships contain “capital
calls” which require LNC to contribute capital



upon notification by the general partner. These
capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment
decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date.
The capital calls are not material in size and pose no threat to
LNC’s liquidity. The capital calls are included on
LNC’s table of contingent commitments within Review of
Consolidated Financial Condition. Limited partnership
investments are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting and the majority of these investments are included in
“Other Investments” on the consolidated balance sheets.

Net Investment Income:

Net Investment income decreased
$71.3 million or 3% in 2002 due to a decrease in the yield
on investments from 7.14% to 6.74% (all calculations on a cost
basis). The decrease in yield was primarily due to lower
interest rates on new securities purchased along with higher
than historical levels of defaults due to the weak economy of
2002. In addition, 2002 net investment income generated by
partnership investments was lower than the unusually favorable
levels of net investment income generated by partnerships in
2001. Net investment income decreased $67.5 million or 2%
in 2001 due to a decrease in the yield on investments from 7.35%
to 7.14% (all calculations on a cost basis). The decrease in the
yield on investments was primarily due to lower interest rates
on new securities purchased along with an increase in security
defaults resulting from the weak economy in 2001. In addition,
LNC transferred higher yielding invested assets, and received
current fair value as part of the close of the sale of the
reinsurance business to Swiss Re on December 7, 2001. The
proceeds of the sale were invested in lower yielding highly
liquid short-term investments. Mean invested assets only
increased 0.4% in 2001.

Critical Accounting Policy —
Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Derivative Instruments:

LNC had net pre-tax realized losses on
investments and derivatives of $271.5 million,
$114.5 million and $28.3 million in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Prior to the amortization of acquisition
costs, provision for policyholder commitments and investment
expenses, net pre-tax realized losses were $405.3 million,
$202.8 million, and $56.4 million in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Also included in the 2002 loss was a pre-tax
realized gain of $33.4 million ($21.7 million
after-tax) from the sale of LNC’s investment in
unconsolidated affiliate related to LNC’s former
Reinsurance segment (see further discussion of this investment
in the Results of Operations for “Other Operations”).

The gross realized gains on fixed maturity and
equity securities were $181.2 million, $223.2 million
and $204.5 million, in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Gross realized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities
were $609.9 million, $459.7 million and
$266.8 million, respectively. Included within losses are
write-downs for impairments of $321.5 million,
$252.9 million and $55.8 million in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Although the realized losses that resulted from
sales and impairments originated from a number of sectors, the
larger losses can be attributed to collateralized debt
obligations (CDOs) and the telecommunications and airline
sectors.

LNC’s overall strategy of reducing exposure
to CDOs was complicated by the deteriorating economy and the
lack of liquidity of these instruments driven by declining
economic conditions and increased corporate default rates. All
these effects negatively impacted the CDO market, resulting in
prolonged implementation of our strategy. As a result of sales
and impairment write-downs, the CDO exposure has been reduced to
approximately 1.6% of LNC’s fixed maturity securities, with
90% rated investment grade.

The losses in the telecommunications sector were
largely due to sales and impairment write-downs of Worldcom
bonds, although there were other telecommunications issuers that
were sold at losses throughout the year. Similar to the
telecommunication sector, LNC also experienced realized losses
in the airline sector due to the bankruptcies of US Airways and
United Airlines. LNC’s exposure to the airline sector is
primarily equipment trust certificates and enhanced equipment
trust certificates. Airplanes collateralize these investments,
but the declines in underlying valuations of airplanes have
resulted in the impairment of LNC’s holdings.



In addition to the aforementioned sectors, the
realized losses and gains in 2002 arose from investment
transactions as a result of the active management of LNC’s
portfolio quality. There were several strategies that drove
transactions, some of which include:

1. In addition to credit evaluations and
    relative value considerations, investments that do not provide
    adequate return relative to statutory capital requirements were
    liquidated and replaced with investments that are more capital
    efficient.

2. Portfolio exposure to certain high-risk
    sectors, such as bonds of issuers that have asbestos related
    litigation risk, was reduced.

3. Small proportions of the LNC portfolio
    are allocated to high-risk asset classes such as emerging
    markets. Given the volatile markets in 2002, the turnover was
    higher on this sub-segment of the portfolio than in previous
    years. This resulted in realized gains as well as realized
    losses.

Significant circumstances that contributed to
realized losses on investments in 2001 included the Enron
bankruptcy, the defaults by Kmart and Argentina, as well as
rapid declines in credit ratings and deterioration of expected
cash flows on various collateralized debt obligation
investments. The loss in 2000 was primarily the result of the
sale of investments, and to a lesser extent the write-down and
provision for losses on investments.

LNC has considered economic factors and
circumstances within countries and industries where recent
write-downs have occurred in its assessment of the status of
securities owned by LNC of similarly situated issuers. While it
is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular
investment to affect other investments, LNC’s risk
management has been designed to identify correlation risks and
other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once
identified, strategies and procedures are developed to
effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk
correlation that LNC’s investment management group pays
particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within
specific financial and business markets, risks within specific
industries and risks associated with related parties.

Critical Accounting Policy —
Write-Downs and Allowance for Losses:

Securities available-for-sale, that
were deemed to have declines in fair value that were other than
temporary were written down to fair value. The fixed maturity
securities to which these write-downs apply were generally of
investment grade quality at the time of purchase, but were
subsequently down graded by rating agencies to
“below-investment grade.” Factors considered by LNC in
determining whether declines in the fair value of fixed maturity
securities are other than temporary include 1) the
significance of the decline, 2) LNC’s ability and
intent to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time
for it to recover, 3) the time period during which there
has been a significant decline in value, and 4) fundamental
analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall
financial condition of the issuer. Based upon these factors,
securities that have indications of potential impairment are
subject to intensive review. Where such analysis results in a
conclusion that declines in fair values are other than
temporary, the security is written down to fair value. See
Note 8 (Fair Value of Financial Instruments) to the
consolidated financial statements for a general discussion of
the methodologies and assumptions used to determine estimated
fair values.

Fair values for private securities are estimated
by (1) a matrix process that employs discounting expected
future cash flows using a current market rate applicable to the
coupon rate, credit quality, industry sector and maturity of the
investments, (2) third party-supplied prices or secondary
market transactions, and (3) applying professional judgment
to arrive at fair value based upon prices of public or
non-public securities of similarly situated issuers. The fair
value for all private securities was $4,601.3 million and
$4,537.7 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, representing about 11.5% and 12.5% of total
invested assets, respectively.

As the discussion above indicates, there are
risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether
declines in the fair value of investments are other than
temporary. These include subsequent significant changes in
general overall economic conditions as well as specific business
conditions affecting particular issuers, future financial market
effects such as interest rate spreads, stability of foreign
governments and economies, future ratings agency actions and
significant accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that



may adversely affect certain investments. In
addition, there are often significant estimates and assumptions
required by LNC to estimate the fair values of securities,
including projections of expected future cash flows and pricing
of private securities. LNC is continuously monitoring
developments and updating underlying assumptions and financial
models based upon new information. Provided below are additional
facts concerning the potential affect upon LNC’s future
earnings and financial position should management later conclude
that some of the current declines in fair value of securities
are other than temporary declines.

EITF 99-20 changed the manner in which impairment
on certain investments in collateralized securities is
determined. The cumulative effect adjustment that LNC recorded
in connection with the adoption of EITF 99-20 in the second
quarter of 2001 was a net realized loss on investments of
$11.3 million after-tax ($17.3 million pre-tax).

Write-downs and allowances for losses on select
mortgage loans on real estate, real estate and other investments
were established when the underlying value of the property was
deemed to be less than the carrying value. These write-downs and
provisions for losses, as well as the write-downs of fixed
maturity and equity securities are disclosed within the notes to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements (see Note 3
to the consolidated financial statements).

Unrealized Gains and Losses:

At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
gross unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale were
$2,402.5 million and $1,075.4 million, respectively, and
gross unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale were
$735.4 million and $659.6 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2002, gross unrealized gains and losses on
fixed maturity securities available-for-sale were
$2,357.5 million and $693.1 million, respectively, and
gross unrealized gains and losses on equity securities
available-for-sale were $11.2 million and
$8.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2001,
gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities
available-for-sale were $1,005.6 million and
$615.9 million, respectively, and gross unrealized gains
and losses on equity securities available-for-sale were
$69.8 million and $43.7 million, respectively. The
great majority of these unrealized gains and losses can be
attributed to changes in interest rates, which have created
temporary price fluctuations. However, within the portfolio of
securities with unrealized losses are certain securities that
LNC has identified as exhibiting indications that the decline in
fair value may be other than a temporary decline in value.

Where detailed analysis by LNC credit analysts
and investment portfolio managers leads to the conclusion that a
security’s decline in fair value is other than temporary,
the security is written down to fair value. In instances where
declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to
be carefully monitored.

The following information is applicable to
unrealized loss securities that were subject to these enhanced
analysis and monitoring processes as of the relevant balance
sheet date. In viewing this information, it is important to
realize that LNC is continuously reviewing and updating the
status of its investment portfolios. Accordingly, the
information presented below relates to the status of securities
that were being monitored at a particular point in time, and may
not be indicative of the status of LNC’s investment
portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, since
the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and
losses through the selection of which securities are sold is
largely at management’s discretion, it is important to
consider the information provided below within the context of
the overall unrealized gain or loss position of LNC’s
investment portfolios. These are important considerations that
should be included in any evaluation of the potential impact of
unrealized loss securities upon LNC’s future earnings. LNC
had an overall net unrealized gain (after the amortization of
acquisition costs, provision for policyholder commitments,
investment expenses and taxes) on securities available-for-sale
under FAS 115 of $753.3 million and $195.7 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The unrealized losses for Lincoln UK Equity
    Securities are primarily related to participating polices in the
    Lincoln UK segment. Gain and losses on securities supporting
    this business are credited to the policyholder when incurred and
    do not affect net income of LNC.



The composition by industry categories of all
securities in unrealized loss status, held by LNC at
December 31, 2001 is presented in the table below.



At December 31, 2002 and 2001, less than 9%
and 5%, respectively, of the traded and private securities held
that were subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for
potential changes in unrealized loss status were rated as
investment grade. The range of maturity dates for these
securities varies, with about 57% of these securities maturing
between 5 and 10 years, about 20% maturing in greater than
10 years and the remaining maturity dates maturing in less
than 5 years. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, 65.3% and
84.7%, respectively of total traded and private securities in
unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. At
December 31, 2002, the range of maturity dates for total
traded and private securities in unrealized loss status varies,
with about 22% maturing between 5 and 10 years, 46%
maturing after 10 years and the remaining securities
maturing in less than 5 years. At December 31, 2001,
the range of maturity dates for these securities varies, with
about 39% maturing between 5 and 10 years, 37% maturing
after 10 years and the remaining securities maturing in
less than 5 years. See Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements for ratings and maturity date information
for LNC’s fixed maturity investment portfolio.

The information presented above is subject to
rapidly changing conditions. As such, LNC expects that the level
of securities with overall unrealized losses will fluctuate, as
will the level of unrealized loss securities that are subject to
enhanced analysis and monitoring. The recent volatility of
financial market conditions has resulted in increased
recognition of both investment gains and losses, as portfolio
risks are adjusted through sales and purchases. As discussed
below, this is consistent with LNC’s classification of its
investment portfolios as available-for-sale.

During the year ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, LNC sold securities at gains and at losses. As discussed
earlier, in the process of evaluating whether a security with an
unrealized loss reflects an other than temporary decline, LNC
considers its ability and intent to hold the security until its
value recovers. However, subsequent decisions on securities
sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring,
assessing value relative to other comparable securities and
overall portfolio maintenance. Although LNC’s portfolio
managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the
preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized
losses that are considered temporary until such losses are
recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result
in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are
consistent with the classification of LNC’s investment
portfolio as available-for-sale. In the future, LNC expects to
continue to



manage all invested assets within its portfolios
in a manner that is consistent with the available-for-sale
classification.

Use of Derivatives:

The primary use of derivatives at LNC
is to hedge interest rate risk that is embedded in either life
insurance and annuity product liabilities or investment
portfolios. To a lesser extent, derivatives are also used to
hedge exposures to foreign currency and equity market risks.
Derivatives held at December 31, 2002 contain industry
standard terms and are entered into with financial institutions
with long-standing, superior performance records.

Review of
Consolidated Financial Condition

Liquidity and Cash Flow

Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise
to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations
to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety.
Because of the interval of time from receipt of deposit or
premium until payment of benefits or claims, LNC and other
insurers employ investment portfolios as an integral element of
operations. By segmenting its investment portfolios along
product lines, LNC enhances the focus and discipline it can
apply to managing the liquidity, as well as the interest rate
and credit risk of each portfolio commensurate with the profile
of the liabilities. For example, portfolios backing products
with less certain cash flows and/or withdrawal provisions are
kept more liquid than portfolios backing products with more
predictable cash flows.

The consolidated statements of cash flows
indicate that operating activities provided cash of
$0.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $2.0 billion in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This statement also
classifies the other sources and uses of cash by investing
activities and financing activities and discloses the amount of
cash available at the end of the year to meet LNC’s
obligations.

Although LNC generates adequate cash flow to meet
the needs of its normal operations, periodically LNC may issue
debt or equity securities to fund internal expansion,
acquisitions, investment opportunities and the retirement of
LNC’s debt and equity. In April 2002, a new shelf
registration statement was declared effective by the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The new shelf registration totaled
$1.2 billion (including $402.5 million of registered
but unissued securities from previous registration statements).
After giving consideration to the $250 million 5.25%
five-year senior notes issued in June 2002, LNC has
$950 million remaining under the shelf registration to
issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants,
stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units of LNC and
trust preferred securities of four subsidiary trusts. The net
proceeds from the sale of the securities offered by this shelf
registration and the applicable prospectus supplement(s) are
expected to be used by LNC for general corporate purposes,
including repurchases of outstanding common stock, repayment or
redemption of outstanding debt or preferred stock, the possible
acquisition of financial services businesses or assets thereof,
investment in portfolio assets and working capital needs. Cash
funds are also available from LNC’s revolving credit
agreements. In June 2002, LNC reduced its revolving bank lines
of credit from $700 million to $500 million when LNC
suspended its commercial paper issuance under its European
Commercial Paper program (see Note 5 to the consolidated
financial statements).

LNC purchased and retired 12,088,100; 11,278,022;
and 6,222,581 shares of common stock at a cost of
$474.5 million, $503.7 million and $210.0 million
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In November 2000, the LNC
board authorized $500 million to repurchase LNC securities.
At the time of this authorization, there was $99.7 million
remaining under a $500 million May 1999 board
authorization. All of the shares repurchased in 2000 came under
the May 1999 board authorization. In July 2001, the LNC board
authorized an additional $500 million to repurchase LNC
securities. In 2001, the remaining amount ($53.4 million) under
the May 1999 board authorization was used and
$450.4 million under the November 2000 board authorization
was used. On August 8, 2002, the LNC Board authorized the
repurchase of up to an additional $600 million of LNC
securities. In 2002, the remaining amount ($49.6 million)
under the November 2000 board authorization was used and
$424.9 million under the July 2001 board authorization was
used. The remaining amount under the combined repurchase
authorization at December 31, 2002 was $675.1 million.



On August 16, 2001, LNC settled mandatory
stock purchase contracts issued in conjunction with the FELINE
PRIDES financing. This action resulted in the issuance of
4.6 million shares of LNC stock at $49.67 per share.
Investors had the option of settling the purchase contract with
separate cash or by having the collateral securing their
purchase obligations sold. In the case of investors who held the
Trust Originated Preferred Securities (“TOPrS”) as
collateral for the purchase contracts, they were permitted to
enter into a remarketing process with proceeds used to settle
the contracts. On August 13, 2001, the remarketing failed
resulting in the retirement of $225 million TOPrS. A total
of $5 million of two-year TOPrS remain outstanding which
represents investors who chose to settle with separate cash and
hold onto their TOPrS until maturity.

On September 13, 2001, LNC redeemed all
8.6 million shares of the $215 million outstanding
8.75% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities,
Series A that were issued by Lincoln National
Capital I and guaranteed by LNC.

On November 19, 2001, LNC issued
6.9 million shares of $172.5 million 7.65% Trust
Preferred Securities (“TRUPS”) through Lincoln
National Capital V. In conjunction with the $172.5 million
TRUPS issue, LNC executed a $172.5 million notional amount
interest rate swap that effectively converted the 7.65% fixed
rate coupon on the TRUPS into a LIBOR-based floating rate
obligation. On December 7, 2001, LNC issued
$250 million 6.20% ten-year senior notes.

On January 7, 2002, LNC redeemed
$100 million 8.35% Trust Originated Preferred Securities
issued by Lincoln Capital II and guaranteed by LNC. On
June 3, 2002, LNC issued $250 million 5.25% five-year
senior notes. The net proceeds of that offering was used for
general corporate purposes, and pending such application, have
been used to pay down short-term debt. In conjunction with the
$250 million debt issue, LNC executed a $100 million
notional amount interest rate swap that effectively converted
the 5.25% fixed rate coupon on the bond into a LIBOR-based
floating rate obligation for that portion of the bond.

On December 7, 2001, Swiss Re acquired
LNC’s reinsurance operation for $2.0 billion. In addition,
LNC retained the capital supporting the reinsurance operation.
After giving affect to the increased levels of capital needed
within the Life Insurance and Lincoln Retirement segments that
results from the change in the ongoing mix of business under
LNC’s internal capital allocation models, the disposition
of LNC’s reinsurance operation has freed-up approximately
$100 million of capital. The transaction structure involved
a series of indemnity reinsurance transactions combined with the
sale of certain stock companies that comprised LNC’s
reinsurance operation. Approximately $0.56 billion of the
proceeds from the transaction were used to pay taxes and
associated deal costs and approximately $1.0 billion was
used to repurchase stock, reduce debt, and support holding
company cash flow needs. LNC used approximately
$0.3 billion to pay the fourth quarter 2002 settlement with
Swiss Re (see the Acquisition and Divestiture section for
regarding the settlement with Swiss Re). Any remaining proceeds
will be dedicated to the ongoing capital needs of LNL.

In order to maximize the use of available cash,
the holding company (LNC) maintains a facility where
subsidiaries can borrow from the holding company to meet their
short-term needs and can invest their short-term funds with the
holding company. Depending on the overall cash availability or
need, the holding company invests excess cash in short-term
investments or borrows funds in the financial markets. In
addition to facilitating the management of cash, the holding
company receives dividends from its subsidiaries, invests in
operating companies, maintains an investment portfolio and pays
shareholder dividends and certain corporate expenses.

LNC’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to
certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the
transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding
company. Generally, these restrictions pose no short-term
liquidity concerns for the holding company. However, as
discussed in detail within Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements, the acquisition of two blocks of business
in 1998 resulted in negative statutory earned surplus for LNL
which triggered certain approval requirements in order for LNL
to declare and pay dividends to LNC. As a result of negative
earned surplus, LNL was required to obtain the prior approval of
the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (“Commissioner”)
before paying any dividends to LNC until its statutory earned
surplus became positive. During the first quarter 2002, LNL
received approval from the Commissioner to reclassify total
dividends of $495 million paid to LNC in 2001 from
LNL’s earned



surplus to paid-in-capital. This change plus the
increase in statutory earned surplus from the indemnity
reinsurance transaction with Swiss Re resulted in positive
statutory earned surplus for LNL at December 31, 2001.

In general, dividends are not subject to prior
approval from the Commissioner provided LNL’s statutory
earned surplus is positive and such dividends do not exceed the
standard limitation of the greater of 10% of total statutory
earned surplus or the amount of statutory earnings in the prior
calendar year. Dividends of $710 million were paid by LNL
to LNC in the second quarter of 2002. These distributions were
made in two installments. The first installment of
$60 million was paid in April. The second installment of
$650 million was paid in June. As both installments exceeded the
standard limitation noted above, a special request was made for
each payment and each was approved by the Commissioner. Both
distributions represented a portion of the proceeds received
from the indemnity reinsurance transaction with Swiss Re. As a
result of the payment of dividends and statutory losses in 2002,
LNL’s statutory earned surplus is negative as of
December 31, 2002. The statutory losses resulted from
realized losses on investments, the effect of the equity markets
and the reserve strengthening in 2002 related to the reinsurance
business sold to Swiss Re. Due to the negative statutory earned
surplus as of December 31, 2002, any dividend(s) paid by
LNL in 2003 will be subject to prior approval from the
Commissioner. As occurred in 2001, dividends approved and paid
while statutory earned surplus is negative are expected to be
classified as a reduction to paid-in-capital.

LNL is recognized as an accredited reinsurer in
the state of New York, which effectively enables it to conduct
reinsurance business with unrelated insurance companies that are
domiciled within the state of New York. As a result, in addition
to regulatory restrictions imposed by the state of Indiana, LNL
is also subject to the regulatory requirements that the State of
New York imposes upon accredited reinsurers.

Contractual
Obligations and Contingent Commitments

The tables below summarize LNC’s obligations
and commitments to make future payments under contracts in place
at December 31, 2002, as well as contingent commitments in
place at December 31, 2002.

Contractual Obligations



Contingent Commitments

(1)

The amount includes a maximum annual increase
    related to the CPI.

(2)

The contract is for a term of 10 years and
    the annual cost is based on a per policy charge plus an amount
    for other services provided. The amounts quoted above are the
    estimated fees as the actual cost will depend on the number of
    policies in force and the applicable inflation rate for the each
    period.

(3)

Total includes $72.0 million of capital
    calls on limited partnership investments, $182.9 million of
    real estate pre-buys and $49.7 million and
    $86.2 million of commitments for mortgage loans and private
    placement securities, respectively.

As of December 31, 2002, LNC’s senior
debt ratings were Moody’s at A3 (“Upper Medium
Grade”), Standard and Poor’s at A-
(“Strong”), Fitch at A (“Strong”) and A.M.
Best at “a” (“Strong”), and LNC’s
commercial paper ratings included Moody’s at P-2
(“Strong”), Standard and Poor’s at A-2
(“Satisfactory”) and Fitch at F-1 (“Very
Strong”). On September 19, 2002 Fitch lowered
LNC’s senior debt ratings from A+ to A and the trust
preferred security ratings for Lincoln Capital III, IV, and V
from A to A- both on “stable outlook.” Fitch’s
action did not impact LNC’s commercial paper rating or the
insurance financial strength ratings of LNC’s insurance
subsidiaries. The move was part of industry-wide action on
several life insurance companies given the recent market
environment and, in the case of LNC, reflects Fitch’s
desire to maintain a traditional three notch separation between
debt and insurance financial strength ratings. The rating action
is expected to have no effect on LNC’s liquidity, access to
capital, or cost of capital. Although there are less investors
for A-2/ P-2 commercial paper and there are periods in which
there is weak investor interest in A-2/ P-2 commercial paper,
through December 31, 2002, liquidity has not been adversely
impacted. LNC can draw upon alternative short-term borrowing
facilities such as revolving bank lines of credit.

At December 31, 2002 LNC maintained three
revolving credit agreements with a group of domestic and foreign
banks totaling $580 million. LNC’s commercial paper is
supported by these facilities, a $200 million 364-day
revolving credit facility maturing in December 2003 and a
$300 million revolving credit facility maturing in December
2005 and a $80 million revolving credit facility,
maintained by Lincoln UK, which matured in January 2003. The UK
facility was renewed in January 2003 for $48 million
maturing in January 2004. At December 31, 2002, LNC had
$12 million in outstanding borrowings under the Lincoln UK
agreement. All three agreements provide for interest on
borrowings based on various money market indices. Under all
three agreements, LNC must maintain senior unsecured long-term
debt ratings of at least S&P A- and Moody’s A3 or be
restricted by an adjusted debt to capitalization ratio.
LNC’s 364-day revolving credit contains a one-year term-out
feature which allows LNC to convert any loans outstanding on the
maturity date of the credit facility into a one-year term loan
subject to a floating interest rate.

On average, LNC’s commercial paper borrowing
rates have increased 0.20% per annum since LNC was downgraded to
an A-2/ P-2 issuer. However, historically there have been times
of greater volatility in commercial paper borrowing rates for an
A-2/ P-2 issuer with the spread above A-1/ P-1 rates ranging



from 0.10% to 0.50%. During such times of greater
volatility, LNC may experience difficulty in placing longer-term
commercial paper (defined as 30-90 day maturities), and as
a result, experience increased short-term financing costs.

If current debt ratings and claims paying ratings
were downgraded in the future, certain covenants of various
contractual obligations may be triggered which could impact
overall liquidity. In addition, contractual selling agreements
with intermediaries could be negatively impacted which could
have an adverse impact on overall sales of annuities, life
insurance and investment products.

As a result of increased cash flow from
operations, Lincoln National (UK) PLC was able to retire
its remaining outstanding commercial paper in the second quarter
of 2002 and LNC eliminated the bank lines and ratings associated
with this program.

On June 3, 2002, LNC announced an agreement
with the Philadelphia Eagles to name the Eagles’ new
stadium, Lincoln Financial Field. In exchange for the naming
rights, LNC agreed to pay $139.6 million over a 20-year
period, through annual payments to the Eagles, which average
approximately $6.7 million per year. This future commitment
has not been recorded as a liability on LNC’s balance sheet
as it will be accounted for in a manner consistent with the
accounting for operating leases.

Effect of
Inflation

LNC’s insurance affiliates, as well as other
companies in the insurance industry, attempt to minimize the
effect of inflation on their revenues and expenses by
anticipating inflationary trends in the pricing of their
products. Inflation, except for changes in interest rates, does
not have a significant effect on LNC’s balance sheet due to
the minimal amount of dollars invested in property, plant and
equipment and the absence of inventories.

Capital
Resources

Total shareholders’ equity increased
$32.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2002.
Accumulated other comprehensive income increased
shareholders’ equity by $561.4 million. The components
of the changes to accumulated other comprehensive income were:
$564.5 million related to the increase in the unrealized
gain on securities available-for-sale and derivative
instruments, $58.8 million related to an increase in the
accumulated foreign exchange gain and a decrease of
$61.9 million for minimum pension liability adjustments.
Excluding changes due to other comprehensive income,
shareholders’ equity decreased $528.6 million. This
decrease is the net of increases due to $91.6 million of
net income and $93.6 million from the issuance of common
stock related to benefit plans and decreases due to $234.3
million from the declaration of dividends to shareholders,
$474.5 million for the retirement of common stock,
$4.5 million for the forfeiture of shares under benefit
plans and $0.5 million for the cancellation of shares
related to the acquisition of subsidiaries

Capital adequacy is a primary measure used by
insurance regulators to determine the financial stability of an
insurance company. In the U.S., risk-based capital guidelines
are used by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
to determine the amount of capital that represents minimum
acceptable operating amounts related to insurance and investment
risks. Regulatory action is triggered when an insurer’s
statutory-basis capital falls below the formula-produced capital
level. At December 31, 2002, statutory-basis capital for
each of LNC’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries was in excess of
regulatory action levels of risk-based capital required by the
jurisdiction of domicile.

As noted above, shareholders’ equity
includes accumulated other comprehensive income. At
December 31, 2002, the book value of $29.82 per share
included $3.85 of accumulated other comprehensive income. At
December 31, 2001, the book value of $28.10 per share
included $0.97 related to accumulated other comprehensive income.



Contingencies

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements for information regarding contingencies.

Legislation

In the 2003 Budget proposal, President Bush
proposed an economic stimulus package and changes to retirement
savings. The centerpiece of the stimulus proposal is the
elimination of the double taxation of corporate dividends. Both
the Bush Administration and Congress have expressed concerns
regarding the impact of the proposal on variable annuities. The
life insurance industry has proposed that dividends in equity
securities held in separate accounts flow through to increase
the basis in the variable annuity contract.

The overall impact of these proposals on
LNC’s products and corporate tax burden cannot be
accurately predicted at this time. Initial legislative language
has been introduced to implement certain aspects of the
President’s proposals, which is currently the subject of
debate and testimony before Congress It is too early to predict
the final form of the legislation that Congress will pass, if
any.

Tax legislation could increase or reduce
tax-advantages for some of LNC’s life insurance and annuity
products. LNC continues to support reductions in the tax burden
imposed on its businesses, employees and policyholders.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk Exposures of Financial
Instruments

LNC analyzes and manages the risks arising from
market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other
risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that
takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential
effect of market and other risks of the entire enterprise, LNC
estimates, reviews and in some cases manages the risk to its
earnings and shareholder value. LNC has exposures to several
market risks including interest rate, default risk, foreign
currency exchange, liquidity and equity price risks.

The exposures of financial instruments to market
risks, and the related risk management processes, are most
important in the Lincoln Retirement (formerly known as
Annuities) and Life Insurance segments. It is within these
segments where most of the invested assets support accumulation
and investment oriented insurance products. As an important
element of its integrated asset-liability management process,
LNC uses derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in
interest levels and the shape of the yield curve. In this
context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to
reduce interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of
significant increases in interest rates on LNC’s earnings.
Additional market exposures exist in LNC’s other general
account insurance products and in its debt structure and
derivatives positions. The primary sources of market risk are:
1) substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or
decreases in interest rates, 2) fluctuations in currency
exchange rates or 3) a sharp drop in equity market values.
Each of these market risks are discussed in detail in the
following pages.

1)     Interest
Rate Risk

Accumulation and Investment Oriented Insurance
Products.

General account assets
supporting accumulation and investment oriented insurance
products total $31.2 billion or 78% and $26.5 billion
or 73% of total invested assets at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

With respect to these products, LNC seeks to earn
a stable and profitable spread between investment income and
interest credited to account values. If LNC has adverse
experience on investments that cannot be passed onto customers,
its spreads are reduced. Alternatively, LNC may seek to maintain
spreads and this may result in crediting rates that are not
competitive in the market place. This strategy could result in
adverse surrender experience on policies and could force LNC to
liquidate a portion of its portfolio to fund cash surrender
value benefits.

LNC does not view the near term risk to spreads
over the next twelve months to be material. The combination of a
probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve
months, asset-liability



management strategies, flexibility in adjusting
policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy
surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to
minimize this risk. The interest rate scenarios of concern are
those in which there is a substantial, relatively rapid increase
or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long
period.

Fixed Deferred Annuities.

Assets of $19.9 billion and
$16.5 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, support the largest category of accumulation and
investment oriented insurance products, fixed deferred
annuities. For these products, LNC may adjust renewal crediting
rates monthly or quarterly, subject to guaranteed minimums
ranging from 3% to 5%. The higher minimums apply to in-force
blocks of older products that no longer are sold. Annuity
insurance customers have the right to surrender their policies
at account value less a surrender charge that grades to zero
over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years from policy issue
date or, in some cases, the date of each premium received. In
some cases, a market value adjustment may also apply. Due to
LNC’s ability to change crediting rates to reflect
investment experience on the majority of its traditional annuity
products, the underlying assets are assumed to be a good proxy
for the interest rate risk inherent in these liabilities. This
assumption is appropriate for probable movements in interest
rates over the next 12 months. This assumption may not be
appropriate for a substantial, relatively rapid increase or
decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long
period.

Universal Life and Interest-Sensitive Whole
Life.

LNC had $9.3 billion and
$8.1 billion in assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, supporting universal life and interest-sensitive
whole life insurance on which it has the right to adjust renewal
crediting rates. The credited rates are subject to guaranteed
minimums ranging from 3% to 4.5% for universal life and 4.0% to
7.0% for interest-sensitive whole life, at December 31,
2002. Similar to annuities, universal life insurance customers
have the right to surrender their policies at account value less
a surrender charge that grades to zero over periods ranging from
10 to 20 years from policy issue date or, in some cases,
the date of each premium received.

Guaranteed Interest Contracts and Group
Pension Annuities.

LNC had assets
totaling $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively that support
guaranteed interest contracts, group pension annuities and
immediate annuities. Generally, the cash flows expected on these
liabilities do not vary with fluctuations in market interest
rates and are not adjustable by LNC. Accordingly, if experience
on the assets supporting these products is more adverse than the
assumptions used in pricing the products, spreads will tend to
be below expectations. LNC limits exposure to interest rate risk
by managing the duration and maturity structure of each
investment portfolio in relation to the liabilities it supports.

Other General Account Insurance Products.

LNC had $8.8 billion and
$9.6 billion of assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, supporting general account products. For these
products, the liability cash flows may have actuarial
uncertainty. However, their amounts and timing do not vary
significantly with interest rates. LNC limits interest rate risk
by analyzing the expected cash flows of the products and
structuring investment portfolios with similar cash flows.

Interest Rate Risk — Falling Rates.

Interest rates declined in 1998, rose
in 1999 and declined again in 2000, 2001 and 2002. For example,
the five-year Treasury yield decreased from 5.7% in 1997 to 4.5%
by the end of 1998, increased to 6.3% by the end of 1999, and
declined from 5.0% at the end of 2000 to 4.3% at the end of 2001
and declined again to 2.70% at the end of 2002. Under scenarios
in which interest rates fall and remain at levels significantly
lower than those prevailing at December 31, 2002, minimum
guarantees on annuity and universal life insurance policies
(generally 3% to 5% or an average of approximately 4%) could
cause the spread between the yield on the portfolio and the
interest rate credited to policyholders to deteriorate. The
earned rate on the annuity and universal life insurance
portfolios averaged 6.8% and 7.3%, respectively, for the year
ended December 31, 2002, providing a cushion for a decline
before the earned rates would be insufficient to cover minimum
guaranteed rates plus the target spread.

The following table provides detail on the
difference between interest crediting rates and minimum
guaranteed rates as of December 31, 2002. For example, at
December 31, 2002, there are $5.920 billion of



combined Retirement and Life Insurance account
values where the excess of the crediting rate over contact
minimums is between 1.51% and 2.00%.

*

For purposes of this exhibit, contracts currently
    within new money rate bands are grouped according to the
    corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon
    their first anniversary.

The maturity structure and call provisions of the
related portfolios are structured to afford protection against
erosion of this cushion for a period of time. However, spreads
would be at risk if interest rates continued to fall and
remained lower for a long period. LNC devotes extensive effort
to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash
flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. LNC seeks to
manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity
structure and by limiting its exposure to call risk in each
respective investment portfolio.

LNC believes that the portfolios supporting its
accumulation and investment oriented insurance products have a
prudent degree of call protection individually and on a
consolidated basis. For instance, as of December 31, 2002,
the mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) and
asset-backed securities (“ABS”) portion represented a
total of $5.0 billion or 17% of the $31.2 billion of
general account assets supporting such products. Of this
portfolio, 11% of general account assets or $3.1 billion is
subject to residential prepayment risk from investments made in
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (“CMOs”), mortgage
pass-throughs, manufactured housing and home equity loans. As of
December 31, 2001, the MBS and ABS portion of the portfolio
represented a total of $3.5 billion or 14% of the
$24.6 billion of general account assets supporting such
products. LNC’s MBS portfolio has equal to or slightly less
prepayment risk than the MBS pass-through market in general
primarily due to holding more seasoned securities in the
portfolio.



Interest Rate Risk — Rising Rates.

For both annuities and universal life
insurance, a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates poses
risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders. The
portfolios supporting these products have fixed-rate assets
laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to ten years
or more. Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags
behind changes in market yields. As rates rise, the lag may be
increased by slowing MBS prepayments. The greater and faster the
rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to
lag behind market rates. If LNC sets renewal crediting rates to
earn the desired spread, the gap between its renewal crediting
rates and competitors’ new money rates may be wide enough
to cause increased surrenders. If LNC credits more competitive
renewal rates to limit surrenders, its spreads will narrow. LNC
devotes extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating
asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate
scenarios. Such analysis has led to adjustments in the target
maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by
buying out-of-the-money interest rate cap agreements and
swaptions (see discussion below). With these instruments in
place, the potential adverse impact of a rapid and sustained
rise in rates is kept within corporate risk tolerances.

Debt.

As of
December 31, 2002, LNC had short-term debt, long-term debt
and company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely junior
subordinated debentures totaling $1.67 billion
($1.22 billion with fixed rates and $0.45 billion with
floating rates) on the balance sheet. As of December 31,
2001, LNC had short-term debt, long-term debt and minority
interest-preferred securities of subsidiary companies totaling
$1.69 billion ($1.27 billion with fixed rates and
$0.42 billion with floating rates) on the balance sheet.
LNC manages the timing of maturities and the mixture of
fixed-rate and floating-rate debt as part of the process of
integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire
enterprise.

Derivatives.

As
indicated in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements, LNC has entered into derivative transactions to
reduce its exposure to rapid rises in interest rates. The four
programs discussed below are used to help LNC achieve more
stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to
policyholders during periods when interest rates are rising.
Failure to maintain competitive crediting rates could cause
policyholders to withdraw their funds and place them in more
competitive products.

LNC uses interest rate cap agreements to hedge
against the negative impact of a significant and sustained rise
in interest rates. Interest rate caps are contracts that require
counterparties to pay LNC at specified future dates the amount,
if any, by which a specified market interest rate exceeds the
cap rate stated in the agreements, applied to a notional amount.
As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, LNC had agreements with
notional amounts of $1.3 billion in both periods. At
December 31, 2002, the agreements had cap rates ranging
from 200 to 850 basis points above prevailing interest rates.
The cap rates in some contracts increase over time. These
agreements expire in 2003 through 2007.

LNC also uses swaptions to hedge against the
negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest
rates. Swaptions are options to enter into a swap at a specified
future date. If the option is exercised at expiration, the
option is either settled in cash or exercised into a swap
agreement. LNC purchases swaptions to be settled in cash. At
expiration, the counterparty is required to pay LNC the amount,
if any, of the present value of the difference between the fixed
rate on a market rate swap and the strike rate stated in the
agreement, applied to a notional amount. As of December 31,
2002 and 2001, LNC had agreements with notional amounts of
$0.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. At
December 31, 2002, the agreements had strike rates ranging
from 550 to 700 basis points above prevailing interest rates.
These agreements expire in 2003.

Notional for swaptions decreased by
$1.6 billion as a result of expirations and a change in the
method of reporting notional. No additional swaptions were
purchased during the year.

For future periods, the fair value of LNC’s
interest rate caps and swaptions depends on the levels of future
U.S. Treasury and U.S. dollar swap interest rates. The table
below shows estimates of fair value levels for the cap and
swaption portfolio at December 31, 2002 for future time
periods and selected potential future interest rate levels.



LNC uses exchange-traded financial futures
contracts to hedge against interest rate risks on a portion of
its fixed maturity securities. Financial futures contracts
obligate LNC to buy or sell a financial instrument at a
specified future date for a specified price. They may be settled
in cash or through delivery of the financial instrument. Cash
settlements on the change in market values of financial futures
contracts are made daily. As of December 31, 2002, LNC did
not have any open futures.

LNC uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge
its exposure to floating rate bond coupon payments, replicating
a fixed rate bond. An interest rate swap is a contractual
agreement to exchange payments at one or more times based on the
actual or expected price level, performance or value of one or
more underlying interest rates. LNC is required to pay the
counterparty the stream of variable interest payments based on
the coupon payments from the hedged bonds, and in turn, receives
a fixed payment from the counterparty, at a predetermined
interest rate. In addition, LNC uses interest rate swap
agreements to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations
related to the forecasted purchase of assets to support newly
acquired blocks of business or certain other portfolios of
assets. Finally, LNC uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge
the risk of paying a higher fixed rate interest on
company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts holding solely junior subordinated debentures
and on senior debt than can be paid on long-term debt based on
current interest rates in the marketplace. As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, LNC had swap agreements with a
notional amount of $701.6 million and $507.6 million,
respectively. The agreements expire in 2003 through 2050.
Notional for interest rate swaps increased $194.0 million
during 2002 primarily as a result of entering into interest rate
swaps to hedge variable rate assets and to convert fixed rate
debt payments into floating rate debt payments.

LNC used a treasury lock agreement to hedge its
exposure to variability in future semi-annual interest payments,
attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, related
to the issuance of its 10-year $250 million senior debt in
December 2001 and its 5-year $250 million senior debt in
2002. A treasury lock is an agreement that allows the holder to
lock in a benchmark interest rate, so that if the benchmark
interest rate increases, the holder is entitled to receive a
payment from the counterparty equal to the present value of the
difference in the benchmark interest rate at the determination
date and the locked-in benchmark interest rate. If the benchmark
interest rate decreases, the holder must pay the counterparty an
amount equal to the present value of the difference in the
benchmark interest rate at the determination date and the
locked-in benchmark interest rate. As of December 31, 2002,
LNC did not have any open treasury locks.

In addition to continuing existing programs, LNC
may use derivative products in other strategies to limit risk
and enhance returns, particularly in the management of
investment spread businesses. LNC has established policies,
guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of
derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall
portfolio of risks assumed in LNC’s operations. Annually,
LNC’s Board of Directors reviews LNC’s derivatives
policy and LNC’s compliance with the policy.

Table of Significant Exposures.

The table below provides a general

    treasury forward curve.

2) Foreign Currency
Risk

Foreign Currency Denominated Investments.

LNC invests in foreign currency
denominated securities for incremental return and risk
diversification relative to United States Dollar-Denominated
(“USD”) securities. The fair value of foreign
securities totaled $975.1 million as of December 31,
2002. LNC periodically uses foreign exchange forward contracts
and foreign currency swaps to hedge some of the foreign exchange
risk related to its investment in securities denominated in
foreign currencies. The currency risk is hedged using foreign
currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds. The
table below shows LNC’s exposure to foreign currency
securities. Also included is the relevant information relating
to the foreign currency derivatives that are hedging the
currency risk of these securities. The table below presents the
principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents by
expected maturity for LNC’s foreign currency denominated
investments and foreign currency swaps as of December 31,
2002.

The table below presents the principal or
notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents of LNC’s foreign
currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps as
of December 31, 2001.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts.

LNC uses foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to
its investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in
foreign currencies. LNC typically engages in short term currency
forward contracts of less than six months and actively monitors
currency markets in determining those currencies to hedge, the
duration of the hedge and the nominal amount to hedge. A foreign
currency forward contract obligates LNC to deliver a specified
amount of currency at a future date at a specified exchange
rate. The value of the foreign exchange forward



contracts at any given point fluctuates according
to the underlying level of exchange rate and interest rate
differentials.

During 2002, LNC entered into foreign currency
forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in
Lincoln UK. At December 31, 2002, the total notional and
fair value for these contracts was $43.0 million and $(1.8)
million, respectively. These contracts expire in 2003.

Foreign Currency Swaps.

A foreign currency swap is a
contractual agreement to exchange the currencies of two
different countries at a specified rate of exchange in the
future. LNC uses foreign currency swaps to convert the cash flow
of foreign currency securities to U.S. dollars.

3) Equity Market
Exposures

LNC’s revenues, assets, liabilities and
derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Refer to the
section captioned “First Quarter 2003 Guidance for the
Estimated Effect of Equity Market Volatility” for
additional discussion of equity market risk.

Fee Revenues.

The
fee revenues of LNC’s Investment Management segment and
fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance
products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market
values. These fees are generally a fixed percentage of the
market value of assets under management. In a severe equity
market decline, fee income could be reduced by not only reduced
market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and
redemptions. Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds
and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to
LNC’s fixed-income accounts and the transfer of funds to
LNC from its competitors’ customers.

Assets.

While LNC
invests in equity assets with the expectation of achieving
higher returns than would be available in its core-fixed-income
investments, the returns on, and values of, these equity
investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than its
fixed income investments. These investments, however, add
diversification benefits to LNC’s fixed income investments.
The table below shows the sensitivity of price changes to
LNC’s equity assets owned.

Liabilities.

LNC has
exposure to U.S. equity markets through stock appreciation
rights (“SARs”) issued in 2000 through 2002. The
aggregate value for vested and non-vested SARs was
$3.7 million and $4.1 million at December 31, 2002,
respectively. The aggregate value for vested and non-vested SARs
was $6.5 million and $15.3 million at
December 31, 2001, respectively. This program is being
hedged with equity derivatives as discussed below.

Derivatives Hedging Equity Risks.

LNC uses OTC equity call options on
LNC stock to hedge against the increase in its liabilities
arising from stock appreciation rights granted on LNC stock in
2000 through 2002. These call options require the counterparty
to pay LNC at specified future expiration dates the amount, if
any, of the increase in LNC’s stock price over the strike
price of the option, applied to the number of contracts. LNC had
1.3 million and 1.1 million call options on an equal
number of shares of LNC stock at



December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The call options expirations are matched to the liabilities and
expire in 2005 through 2007.

Default Risk.

LNC’s portfolio of invested
assets was $40.0 billion as of December 31, 2002. Of
this total, $25.9 billion consists of corporate bonds and
$4.2 billion consists of commercial mortgages. LNC manages
the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by
applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting
standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower-quality,
higher-yielding investments, and diversifying exposures by
issuer, industry, region and property type. For each
counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, LNC’s
exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in
relation to formal limits set by rating quality and industry
group. LNC remains exposed to occasional adverse cyclical
economic downturns during which default rates may be
significantly higher than the long-term historical average used
in pricing. As of December 31, 2001, LNC had a portfolio of
invested assets of $36.1 billion.

LNC is depending on the ability of derivative
product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations
to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives
agreements. In order to minimize the risk of default losses, LNC
diversifies its exposures among several dealers and limits the
amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating
of each dealer or its guarantor. LNC generally limits its
selection of counterparties that are obligated under these
derivative contracts to those with an A credit rating or above.

Credit-Related
Derivatives.

LNC periodically uses
spread-lock agreements to hedge a portion of the value of its
fixed maturity investments against the risk of widening in the
spreads between their yields and the yields of comparable
maturity U.S. or other Government obligations. As of
December 31, 2002, LNC did not have any open spread-lock
agreements. LNC used put options, combined with various
perpetual fixed-income securities and interest rate swaps to
replicate fixed-income, fixed-maturity investments. The risk
being hedged was a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns
with the international bond issuers.

The put options allowed LNC to put the bonds back
to the counterparties at original par. As of December 31,
2002, LNC did not have any open put options.

LNC uses credit default swaps to hedge against a
drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond
issuers. A credit swap allows LNC to put the bond back to the
counterparty at par upon a credit event by the bond issuer. A
credit event is defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or
obligation acceleration. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
LNC had credit swaps with a notional amount of $26 million
and $29 million, respectively. The credit swaps expire in
2003 through 2006.

LNC used total return swaps to hedge its exposure
to interest rate and spread risk resulting from the forecasted
sale of assets in a securitization of certain LNC mortgage
loans. A total return swap is an agreement that allows the
holder to protect itself against loss of value by effectively
transferring the economic risk of asset ownership to the
counterparty. The holder pays (receives) the total return
equal to interest plus capital gains or losses on a referenced
asset and receives a floating rate of interest. As of
December 31, 2002, LNC did not have any open total return
swaps.

Ratings-based Termination Events.

LNC and LNL are required to maintain
minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice in negotiating
ISDA agreements. Under the majority of ISDA agreements and as a
matter of policy, LNL has agreed to maintain financial strength
or claims-paying ratings above S&P BBB and Moody’s
Baa2. A downgrade below these levels would result in termination
of the derivatives contract at which time any amounts payable by
LNC would be dependent on the market value of the underlying
derivative contract. In certain transactions, LNC and the
counterparty have entered into a collateral support agreement
requiring LNC to post collateral upon significant downgrade. LNC
is required to maintain long-term senior debt ratings above
S&P BBB and Moody’s Baa2. LNC also requires for its own
protection minimum rating standards for counterparty credit
protection. LNL is required to maintain financial strength or
claims-paying ratings above S&P A- and Moody’s A3 under
certain ISDA agreements, which collectively do not represent
material notional exposure. LNC does not believe the inclusion
of termination or collateralization events pose any material
threat to its liquidity position.

1.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation.

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include Lincoln National Corporation
(“LNC”) and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Through
subsidiary companies, LNC operates multiple insurance and
investment management businesses divided into four business
segments (see Note 9). The collective group of companies
uses “Lincoln Financial Group” as its marketing
identity. Less than majority-owned entities in which LNC has at
least a 20% interest are reported on the equity basis. These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

Use of Estimates.

The nature of the insurance and investment management businesses
requires management to make numerous estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results will differ
from those estimates.

Investments.

LNC
classifies its fixed maturity and equity securities as
available-for-sale and, accordingly, such securities are carried
at fair value. The cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted
for amortization of premiums and discounts. The cost of fixed
maturity and equity securities is reduced to fair value with a
corresponding charge to realized loss on investments for
declines in value that are other than temporary.

For the mortgage-backed securities portion of the
fixed maturity securities portfolio, LNC recognizes income using
a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and
the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of
prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to
reflect the revised anticipated future payments. The new
effective yield is used to recognize income on the security
prospectively. This adjustment is reflected in net investment
income.

Mortgage loans on real estate, which are
primarily held in the Life Insurance and Retirement segments,
are carried at the outstanding principal balances adjusted for
amortization of premiums and discounts and are net of valuation
allowances. Valuation allowances are established for the excess
carrying value of the mortgage loan over its estimated fair
value when it is probable that, based upon current information
and events, LNC will be unable to collect all amounts due under
the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When LNC determines
that a loan is impaired, the cost is adjusted or a provision for
loss is established equal to the difference between the
amortized cost of the mortgage loan and the estimated value.
Estimated value is based on: 1) the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate; 2) the loan’s observable
market price; 3) the fair value of the collateral. The
provision for losses is reported as realized gain (loss) on
investments. Mortgage loans deemed to be uncollectible are
charged against the allowance for losses and subsequent
recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for losses.
Interest income on mortgage loans includes interest collected,
the change in accrued interest, and amortization of premiums and
discounts. Mortgage loan fees and costs are recorded in net
investment income as they are incurred.

Investment real estate is carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Cost is adjusted for impairment when the projected undiscounted
cash flow from the investment is less than the carrying value.
Impaired real estate is written down to the estimated fair value
of the real estate, which is generally computed using the
present value of expected future cash flows from the real estate
discounted at a rate commensurate with the underlying risks.
Also, valuation allowances for losses are established, as
appropriate, for real estate holdings that are in the process of
being sold. Real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings
is reclassified on the balance sheet from mortgage loans on real
estate to real estate and is recorded at fair value at the
settlement date, which establishes a new cost basis. If a
subsequent periodic review of a foreclosed property indicates
the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is lower than the
carrying value at settlement date, the carrying value is
adjusted to the lower amount. Write-downs to real estate and any
changes to the reserves on real estate are reported as realized
gain (loss) on investments.

Policy loans are carried at aggregate unpaid
balances.



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and invested cash are carried at cost and
include all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less.

Realized gain (loss) on investments is recognized
in net income, net of associated amortization of deferred
acquisition costs and investment expenses, using the specific
identification method. Changes in the fair values of securities
carried at fair value are reflected directly in
shareholders’ equity, after deductions for related
adjustments for deferred acquisition costs and amounts required
to satisfy policyholder commitments that would have been
recorded had these securities been sold at their fair value, and
after deferred taxes or credits to the extent deemed recoverable.

Realized gain (loss) on sale of subsidiaries, net
of taxes, is recognized in net income.

Derivative Instruments.

For the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, LNC hedged certain portions of its exposure
to interest rate fluctuations, the widening of bond yield
spreads over comparable maturity U.S. Government
obligations, credit risk, foreign exchange risk and equity risk
fluctuations by entering into derivative transactions. A
description of LNC’s accounting for its hedging of such
risks is discussed in the following paragraphs.

Effective upon the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
(“FAS 133”) on January 1, 2001, LNC
recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.
FAS 133 standardized the accounting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
in other contracts. The accounting for changes in the fair value
of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been
designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and
further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as
hedging instruments, LNC must designate the hedging instrument
based upon the exposure being hedged — as a cash flow
hedge, fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a
foreign operation. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, LNC
had derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as
cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. In addition, LNC had
derivative instruments that were economic hedges, but were not
designated as hedging instruments under FAS 133. LNC also
had derivative instruments that were designated as hedges of a
portion of its net investment in a foreign operation at
December 31, 2002.

For derivative instruments that are designated
and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and
reclassified into net income in the same period or periods
during which the hedged transaction affects net income. The
remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of
the cumulative change in the present value of designated future
cash flows of the hedged item (hedge ineffectiveness), if any,
is recognized in current income during the period of change. For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair
value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as
well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income
during the period of change in fair values. For derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net
investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss is reported
in OCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment to the
extent it is effective. For derivative instruments not
designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is
recognized in current income during the period of change.

See Note 7 for further discussion of
LNC’s accounting policy for derivative instruments.

Prior to January 1, 2001, derivative
instruments were carried in other investments. The premiums paid
for interest rate caps and swaptions were deferred and amortized
to net investment income on a straight-line basis over the term
of the respective derivative. Interest rate caps that hedged
interest credited on fixed annuity liabilities were carried at
amortized cost. Any settlement received in accordance with the
terms of the interest rate caps was also recorded as net
investment income. Realized gain (loss) from the termination of
the interest rate caps was included in net income.



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Swaptions, put options, spread-lock agreements,
interest rate swaps and financial futures that hedge fixed
maturity securities available-for-sale were carried at fair
value. The change in fair value was reflected directly in
shareholders’ equity. Settlements on interest rate swaps
and commodity swaps were recognized in net investment income.
Realized gain (loss) from the termination of swaptions, put
options, spread-lock agreements, interest rate swaps and
financial futures were deferred and amortized over the life of
the hedged assets as an adjustment to the yield.
Forward-starting interest rate swaps were also used to hedge the
forecasted purchase of investments. These interest rate swaps
were carried off-balance sheet until the occurrence of the
forecasted transaction at which time the interest rate swaps
were terminated and any gain (loss) on termination was used to
adjust the basis of the forecasted purchase. If the forecasted
purchase did not occur or the interest rate swaps were
terminated early, changes in the fair value of the swaps were
recorded in net income.

Over-the-counter call options which hedged
liabilities tied to the S&P stock index were carried at fair
value. The change in fair value was reflected directly in net
income. Gain (loss) realized upon termination of these call
options was included in net income. Over-the-counter call
options which hedge stock appreciation rights were carried at
fair value when hedging vested stock appreciation rights and at
cost when hedging unvested stock appreciation rights. The change
in fair value of call options hedging vested stock appreciation
rights was included in net income. Gain (loss) upon termination
was reported in net income.

Foreign exchange forward contracts which hedged
debt issued by Lincoln UK in a foreign currency were carried at
fair value. The change in fair value was included in income.
Gain (loss) upon termination was reported in net income. Foreign
currency swaps, which hedged some of the foreign exchange risk
of investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in
foreign currencies, were carried at fair value. The change in
fair value was included in shareholders’ equity. Realized
gain (loss) from the termination of such derivatives was
included in net income. Foreign exchange forward contracts were
also used to hedge LNC’s net investment in a foreign
subsidiary. These foreign exchange forward contracts were
initially carried at zero. Carrying value was adjusted for
changes in the currency spot rate, as well as amortization of
forward points. Changes in carrying value were recorded in the
foreign currency translation adjustment.

Prior to January 1, 2001, hedge accounting
was applied as indicated above after LNC determined that the
items to be hedged exposed LNC to interest rate fluctuations,
the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity
U.S. Government obligations, credit risk, foreign exchange
risk or equity risk. Moreover, the derivatives used to hedge
these exposures were designated as hedges and reduced the
indicated risk demonstrating a high correlation between changes
in the value of the derivatives and the items being hedged at
both the inception of the hedge and throughout the hedge period.
If such criteria was not met or if the hedged items were sold,
terminated or matured, the change in value of the derivatives
was included in net income.

Loaned Securities.

Securities loaned are treated as
collateralized financing transactions and a liability is
recorded equal to the cash collateral received which is
typically greater than the market value of the related
securities loaned. In other instances, LNC will hold as
collateral securities with a market value at least equal to the
securities loaned. Securities held as collateral are not
recorded in LNC’s consolidated balance sheet in accordance
with accounting guidance for secured borrowings and collateral.
LNC’s agreements with third parties generally contain
contractual provisions to allow for additional collateral to be
obtained when necessary. LNC values collateral daily and obtains
additional collateral when deemed appropriate.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment owned for
company use is carried at cost less allowances for depreciation.
Provisions for depreciation of investment real estate and
property and equipment owned for company use are computed
principally on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets.

Premiums and Fees on Investment Products and
Universal Life and Traditional Life Insurance
Products.

Investment Products and
Universal Life Insurance Products:

Investment products
consist primarily of individual and group variable and fixed
deferred annuities. Universal life insurance products include
universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance,
corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance and
other interest-sensitive life insurance policies. Revenues for
investment products and universal life insurance products
consist of net investment income, asset based fees, cost of
insurance charges, percent of premium charges, policy
administration charges and surrender charges that have been
assessed and earned against policy account balances and premiums
received during the period. The timing of revenue recognition as
it relates to fees assessed on investment contracts is
determined based on the nature of such fees. Asset based fees,
cost of insurance and policy administration charges are assessed
on a daily or monthly basis and recognized as revenue when
assessed and earned. Percent of premium charges are assessed at
the time of premium payment and recognized as revenue when
assessed and earned. Certain amounts assessed that represent
compensation for services to be provided in future periods are
reported as unearned revenue and recognized in income over the
periods benefited. Surrender charges are recognized upon
surrender of a contract in accordance with contractual terms.

Traditional Life Insurance
Products:

Traditional life insurance
products include those products with fixed and guaranteed
premiums and benefits and consist primarily of whole life
insurance, limited-payment life insurance, term life insurance
and certain annuities with life contingencies. Premiums for
traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenue
when due from the policyholder.

Investment Advisory Fees.

As specified in the investment
advisory agreements with the mutual funds, fees are generally
determined and recognized as revenues monthly, based on the
average daily net assets of the mutual funds managed. Investment
advisory contracts with other types of clients generally provide
for the determination and payment of advisory fees based on
market values of managed portfolios at the end of a calendar
month or quarter. Investment management and advisory contracts
typically are renewable annually with cancellation clauses
ranging up to 90 days.

Assets Held in Separate Accounts/ Liabilities
Related to Separate Accounts.

These
assets and liabilities represent segregated funds administered
and invested by LNC’s insurance subsidiaries for the
exclusive benefit of pension and variable life and annuity
contractholders. Both the assets and liabilities are carried at
fair value. The fees earned by LNC’s insurance subsidiaries
for administrative and contractholder maintenance services
performed for these separate accounts are included in insurance
fee revenue.

Deferred Acquisition Costs.

Commissions and other costs of
acquiring universal life insurance, variable universal life
insurance, unit-linked products, traditional life insurance,
annuities and other investment contracts, which vary with and
are primarily related to the production of new business, have
been deferred to the extent recoverable. The methodology for
determining the amortization of acquisition costs varies by
product type based on two different accounting pronouncements:
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97,
“Accounting by Insurance Companies For Certain
Long-Duration Contracts & Realized Gains and Losses on
Investment Sales” (“FAS 97”) and Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60, “Accounting
and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises”
(“FAS 60”). Under FAS 97, acquisition costs
for universal life and variable universal life insurance and
investment-type products, which include unit-linked products and
fixed and variable deferred annuities, are amortized over the
lives of the policies in relation to the incidence of estimated
gross profits from surrender charges; investment, mortality net
of reinsurance ceded and expense margins; and actual realized
gain (loss) on investments.

Past amortization amounts are adjusted when
revisions are made to the estimates of current or future gross
profits expected from a group of products. Policy lives for
universal and variable universal life policies are estimated to
be 30 years, based on the expected lives of the policies and are
variable based on the inception of each policy for unit-linked
policies. Policy lives for fixed and variable deferred annuities
are 13 to 18 years for the traditional, long surrender
charge period products and 8 to 10 years for the more
recent short-term, or no



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

surrender charge products. The front-end load
annuity product has an assumed life of 25 years. Longer
lives are assigned to those blocks that have demonstrated
favorable experience.

Under FAS 60, acquisition costs for
traditional life insurance products, which include whole life
and term life insurance contracts, are amortized over periods of
10 to 30 years on either a straight-line basis or as a
level percent of premium of the related policies depending on
the block of business. There are currently no deferred
acquisition costs being amortized under FAS 60 for fixed
and variable payout annuities.

For all FAS 97 and FAS 60 policies,
amortization is based on assumptions consistent with those used
in the development of the underlying policy form adjusted for
emerging experience and expected trends.

Policy sales charges that are collected in the
early years of an insurance policy have been deferred (referred
to as “deferred front-end loads”) and are amortized
into income over the life of the policy in a manner consistent
with that used for DAC. (See above for discussion of
amortization methodologies.)

Benefits and Expenses.

Benefits and expenses for universal
life-type and other interest-sensitive life insurance products
include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit
claims incurred during the period in excess of policy account
balances. Interest crediting rates associated with funds
invested in the general account of LNC’s insurance
subsidiaries during 2000 through 2002 ranged from 4.00% to
10.00%. For traditional life, group health and disability income
products, benefits and expenses, other than deferred acquisition
costs, are recognized when incurred in a manner consistent with
the related premium recognition policies.

Interest and debt expense includes interest on
company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts holding solely junior subordinated debentures.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Prior to January 1, 2002,
goodwill, as measured by the excess of the cost of acquired
subsidiaries or businesses over the fair value of net assets
acquired, was amortized using the straight-line method over
periods of 20 to 40 years in accordance with the benefits
expected to be derived from the acquisitions. Effective
January 1, 2002, goodwill is not amortized, but is subject
to impairment tests conducted at least annually.

Insurance businesses typically produce ongoing
profit streams from expected new business generation that extend
significantly beyond the maximum 40-year period allowed for
goodwill amortization. Accordingly, for acquired insurance
businesses where financial modeling indicated that anticipated
new business benefits would extend for 40 years or longer,
goodwill was amortized over a 40-year period.

Other intangible assets for acquired insurance
businesses consist of the value of existing blocks of business
(referred to as the “present value of in-force”). The
present value of in-force is amortized over the expected lives
of the block of insurance business in relation to the incidence
of estimated profits expected to be generated on universal life
and investment-type products acquired and over the premium
paying period for insurance products acquired, (i.e.,
traditional life insurance products). Amortization is based upon
assumptions used in pricing the acquisition of the block of
business and is adjusted for emerging experience. Accordingly,
amortization periods and methods of amortization for present
value of in-force vary depending upon the particular
characteristics of the underlying blocks of acquired insurance
business.

Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill relating
to acquisitions of investment management subsidiaries was
amortized using the straight-line method, over a 25-year period.
Effective January 1, 2002, goodwill is not amortized, but
is subject to impairment tests conducted at least annually.
Other intangible assets relating to these acquisitions include
institutional customer relationships, covenants not to compete
and mutual fund customer relationships. These assets are still
required to be amortized on a straight-line basis over their
useful life for periods ranging from 6 to 15 years
depending upon the characteristics of the particular underlying
relationships for the intangible asset.



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Prior to January 1, 2002, the carrying
values of goodwill and other intangible assets were reviewed
periodically for indicators of impairment in value that are
other than temporary, including unexpected or adverse changes in
the following: (1) the economic or competitive environments
in which the company operates, (2) profitability analyses,
(3) cash flow analyses, and (4) the fair value of the
relevant subsidiary. If there was an indication of impairment
then the cash flow method would be used to measure the
impairment and the carrying value would be adjusted as
necessary. However, effective January 1, 2002, goodwill is
subject to impairment tests conducted at least annually. Other
intangible assets will continue to be reviewed periodically for
indicators of impairment consistent with the policy that was in
place prior to January 1, 2002.

Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities.

The liabilities for future policy
benefits and claim reserves for universal and variable universal
life insurance policies consist of policy account balances that
accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender
charges. The liabilities for future insurance policy benefits
and claim reserves for traditional life policies are computed
using assumptions for investment yields, mortality and
withdrawals based principally on generally accepted actuarial
methods and assumptions at the time of policy issue. Interest
assumptions for traditional direct individual life reserves for
all policies range from 2.25% to 6.75% depending on the time of
policy issue. The interest assumptions for immediate and
deferred paid-up annuities range from 1.50% to 13.55%.

The liabilities for future claim reserves for the
guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) feature on
certain variable annuity contracts are a function of the net
amount at risk (“NAR”), mortality, persistency and
incremental death benefit mortality and expense assessments
(“M&E”) expected to be incurred over the period of
time for which the NAR is positive. At any point in time, the
NAR is the difference between the potential death benefit
payable and the total variable annuity account values subject to
the GMDB. At each quarterly valuation date, the GMDB reserves
are calculated for every variable annuity contract with a GMDB
feature based on projections of account values and NAR followed
by the computation of the present value of expected NAR death
claims using product pricing mortality assumptions less expected
GMDB M&E revenue during the period for which the death
benefit options are assumed to be in the money. As part of the
estimate of future NAR, gross equity growth rates which are
consistent with those used in the DAC valuation process are
utilized.

With respect to its insurance and investment
contract liabilities, LNC continually reviews its:
1) overall reserve position; 2) reserving techniques
and 3) reinsurance arrangements. As experience develops and
new information becomes known, liabilities are adjusted as
deemed necessary. The effects of changes in estimates are
included in the operating results for the period in which such
changes occur.

Reinsurance.

LNC’s insurance companies enter
into reinsurance agreements with other companies in the normal
course of their business. Prior to the acquisition of LNC’s
reinsurance operations by Swiss Re on December 7, 2001,
LNC’s insurance subsidiaries assumed reinsurance from
unaffiliated companies. The transaction with Swiss Re involved a
series of indemnity reinsurance transactions combined with the
sale of certain stock companies that comprised LNC’s
reinsurance operations. Assets/liabilities and premiums/benefits
from certain reinsurance contracts that granted statutory
surplus to other insurance companies are netted on the
consolidated balance sheets and income statements, respectively,
since there is a right of offset. All other reinsurance
agreements including the Swiss Re indemnity reinsurance
transaction are reported on a gross basis.

Postretirement Medical and Life Insurance
Benefits.

LNC accounts for its
postretirement medical and life insurance benefits using the
full accrual method.

Stock Options.

Through 2002, LNC recognized compensation expense for its stock
option incentive plans using the intrinsic value method of
accounting. Under the terms of the intrinsic value method,
compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market
price of the stock at the grant date, or other measurement date,
over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. On
August 8, 2002, LNC



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

announced plans to expense the fair value of
employee stock options beginning in 2003 under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS 123”).
On December 31, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure”
(“FAS 148”), which provides alternative methods
of transition for entities that change to the fair value method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure provisions of
FAS 123 to require expanded and more prominent disclosure
of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with
respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net
income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial
statements.

The three transition methods provided under
FAS 148 are the prospective method, the modified
prospective and the retroactive restatement method. LNC will
adopt the retroactive restatement method, which requires that
companies restate all periods presented to reflect stock-based
employee compensation cost under the fair value accounting
method in FAS 123 for all employee awards granted, modified
or settled in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1994. FAS 148’s amendment of the transition and annual
disclosure requirements of FAS 123 is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2002. As the recognition
provisions of FAS 123 should be applied as of the beginning
of the year, LNC will adopt the fair value method of accounting
under FAS 123, as amended by FAS 148, as of
January 1, 2003 and will present restated financial
statements for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 in its first
quarter 2003 filing on Form 10-Q (see Note 6 for
further discussion of stock-based employee compensation cost).

The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and earnings per share for 2002, 2001 and 2000 if LNC had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123.

Foreign Exchange.

LNC’s foreign subsidiaries’
balance sheet accounts and income statement items are translated
at the current exchange and average exchange rates for the year,
respectively. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as
a component of shareholders’ equity. Other translation
adjustments for foreign currency transactions that affect cash
flows are reported in comprehensive income.

Earnings per Share.

Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the
average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is
computed assuming the conversion or exercise of dilutive
convertible preferred securities, non-vested stock, stock
options and deferred compensation shares outstanding during the
year.

Reclassifications.

Certain amounts reported in prior
years’ consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the
current year. These reclassifications have no effect on net
income or shareholders’ equity of the prior years.

2.     Changes in
Accounting Principles and Changes in Estimates

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.

In June 1998, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“FAS 133”). In July 1999, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 137, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities — Deferral of the Effective Date of
FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS 137”),
which delayed the effective date of FAS 133 one year (i.e.,
adoption required no later than the first quarter of 2001). In
June 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities”
(“FAS 138”), which addresses a limited number of
implementation issues arising from FAS 133.

LNC adopted FAS 133, as amended, on
January 1, 2001. Upon adoption, the provisions of
FAS 133 were applied prospectively. The transition
adjustments that LNC recorded upon adoption of FAS 133 on
January 1, 2001 resulted in a net loss of $4.3 million
after-tax or $0.02 per share ($6.6 million pre-tax)
recorded in net income, and a net gain of $17.6 million
after-tax or $0.09 per share ($27.1 million pre-tax)
recorded as a component of Other Comprehensive Income
(“OCI”) in equity. Deferred acquisition costs of
$4.8 million were restored and netted against the
transition loss on derivatives recorded in net income and
deferred acquisition costs of $18.3 million were amortized
and netted against the transition gain recorded in OCI. A
portion of the transition adjustment ($3.5 million
after-tax) recorded in net income upon adoption of FAS 133
was reclassified from the OCI account, Net Unrealized Gain on
Securities Available-for-Sale. These transition adjustments were
reported in the financial statements as a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle.

Change in Estimate of Premium Receivables on
Certain Client-Administered Individual Life
Reinsurance.

During the first quarter
of 2001, LNC’s former Reinsurance segment refined its
estimate of due and unpaid premiums on its client-administered
individual life reinsurance business. As a result of the
significant growth in the individual life reinsurance business
generated in recent years, the Reinsurance segment initiated a
review of the block of business in the last half of 2000. An
outgrowth of that analysis resulted in a review of the
estimation of premiums receivable for due and unpaid premiums on
client-administered business. During the first quarter of 2001,
the Reinsurance segment completed the review of this matter, and
concluded that enhanced information flows and refined actuarial
techniques provided a basis for a more precise estimate of
premium receivables on this business. As a result, the
Reinsurance segment recorded income of $25.5 million or
$0.13 per share ($39.3 million pre-tax) related to
periods prior to 2001.

Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment
on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets.

On April 1,
2001, LNC adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and
Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in
Securitized Financial Assets” (“EITF 99-20”).
EITF 99-20 was effective for fiscal quarters beginning after
March 15, 2001. EITF 99-20 changed the manner in which LNC
determined impairment of certain investments including
collateralized bond obligations. Upon the adoption of EITF
99-20, LNC recognized a net realized loss on investments of
$11.3 million after-tax or $0.06 per share
($17.3 million pre-tax) reported as a cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle. In arriving at this amount,
deferred acquisition costs of $12.2 million were restored
and netted against net realized loss on investments.

Accounting for Business Combinations and
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
“Business Combinations” (“FAS 141”),
and No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“FAS 142”). FAS 141 is
effective for all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001, and FAS 142 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the new
rules, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subject to
impairment tests conducted at least annually in accordance with
the new standards. Intangible assets that do not have indefinite
lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful
lives. LNC



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

adopted FAS 142 on January 1, 2002.
After consideration of the provisions of the new standards
regarding proper classification of goodwill and other intangible
assets on the consolidated balance sheet, LNC did not reclassify
any goodwill or other intangible balances held as of
January 1, 2002.

In compliance with the transition provision of
FAS 142, LNC completed the first step of the transitional
goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of 2002. The
valuation techniques used by LNC to estimate the fair value of
the group of assets comprising the different reporting units
varied based on the characteristics of each reporting
unit’s business and operations. A number of valuation
approaches, including, discounted cash flow modeling, were used
to assess the goodwill of the reporting units within LNC’s
Lincoln Retirement, Life Insurance and Lincoln UK segments.
Valuation approaches combining multiples of revenues, earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(“EBITDA”) and assets under management were used to
estimate the fair value of the reporting units within LNC’s
Investment Management segment. The results of the first step of
the tests indicate that LNC does not have impaired goodwill. In
accordance with FAS 142, LNC has chosen October 1 as
its annual review date. As such, LNC performed another valuation
review during the fourth quarter of 2002. The results of the
first step of the tests performed as of October 1, 2002
indicate that LNC does not have impaired goodwill. The valuation
techniques used by LNC for each reporting unit were consistent
with those used during the transitional testing.

As a result of the application of the
non-amortization provisions of the new standards, LNC had an
increase in net income of $41.7 million ($0.22 per
common share on a fully diluted basis) for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

During 2002, the consolidated carrying value of
goodwill changed as a result of changes to the goodwill balances
in the Lincoln UK and Retirement segments. The Lincoln UK
segment’s carrying value changed as a result of the
translation of the Lincoln UK balance from British pounds to
U.S. dollars based on the prevailing exchange rate as of
the balance sheet date. The adjustment to the Retirement segment
carrying value was a result of the acquisition of The
Administrative Management Group, Inc. (“AMG”). Total
purchased goodwill in 2002 was $20.2 million (see
Note 11).

The carrying amount of goodwill by reportable
segment as of December 31, 2002 is as follows:



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The reconciliation of reported net income to
adjusted net income is as follows:

For intangible assets subject to amortization,
the total gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in
total and for each major intangible asset class by segment are
as follows:

*

The non-compete agreements included in the
    Investment Management segment as of December 31, 2001 were
    fully amortized during the first quarter of 2002 resulting in a
    net carrying value of zero at December 31, 2002.

**

The gross carrying amount and accumulated
    amortization of the present value of in-force for the Lincoln UK
    segment changed from December 31, 2001 to December 31,
    2002 due to the translation of the balances from British pounds
    to U.S. dollars based on the prevailing exchange rate as of
    the balance sheet dates.

The aggregate amortization expense for other
intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000 was $144.7 million, $125.2 million and
$150.3 million, respectively.

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets.

In August 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(“FAS 144”), which addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets and supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of,” and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of
Operations” for a disposal of a segment of a business.
FAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. LNC adopted FAS 144 on
January 1, 2002 and the adoption of the Statement did not
have a material impact on the consolidated financial position
and results of operations of LNC.

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities.

In June 2002, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”
(“FAS 146”), which addresses financial accounting
and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Action
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)”
(“Issue 94-3”). The principal difference between
FAS 146 and Issue 94-3 is that FAS 146 requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather
than at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan.
FAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities after
December 31, 2002. Adoption of FAS 146 by LNC will
result in a change in timing of when expense is recognized for
restructuring activities after December 31, 2002.

Change in Estimate for Disability Income and
Personal Accident Reinsurance
Reserves.

As a result of developments
and information obtained during 2002 relating to personal
accident and disability income matters, LNC increased these
exited business reserves by $198.5 million after-tax or
$1.07 per fully diluted share ($305.4 million
pre-tax). After giving effect to LNC’s $100 million
indemnification obligation to Swiss Re, LNC recorded a
$133.5 after-tax ($205.4 million pre-tax) increase in
reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re with a corresponding
increase in the deferred gain. (See Note 11 for further
explanation of LNC’s Reinsurance transaction with
Swiss Re.)

Accounting for Variable Interest Entities.

In January 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (“Interpretation No.
46”), which requires the consolidation of variable interest
entities (“VIE”) by an enterprise if that enterprise
has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the
VIE’s expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of
the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur, or
both. If one enterprise will absorb a majority of a VIE’s
expected losses and another enterprise will receive a majority
of that VIE’s expected residual returns, the enterprise
absorbing a majority of the losses shall consolidate the VIE.
VIE refers to an entity in which equity investors do not have
the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do
not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support

quarter of 2003 to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a variable
interest that is acquired before February 1, 2003. This
Interpretation may be applied prospectively with a

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Among the matters that LNC is currently reviewing
in connection with the third quarter 2003 effective date of
Interpretation No. 46 to existing VIEs is the potential
application to Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) pools
that are managed by LNC. If the fees earned by LNC for managing
these CDOs are required to be included in the analysis of
expected residual returns, it is possible that such CDO pools
would fall under the consolidation requirements of
Interpretation No. 46. While LNC does not currently have
access to all information necessary to determine the ultimate
effects of such a required consolidation (because LNC is not the
trustee or administrator to the CDOs), based upon currently
available information, LNC estimates that the effect of
consolidation would result in recording additional assets and
liabilities on LNC’s consolidated balance sheet of about
$1.3 billion. If such liabilities are required to be
recorded, LNC would disclose that such liabilities are without
recourse to LNC, as LNC’s role of investment manager for
such CDO pools does not expose LNC to risk of loss.

Although LNC and the industry continue to review
the new rules, at the present time LNC does not believe there
are other significant VIEs that would result in consolidation
with LNC, beyond the managed CDOs discussed above.

During the second quarter of 1998, LNC purchased
three bonds issued with offsetting interest rate
characteristics. Subsequent to the purchase of these bonds,
interest rates increased and the value of one of these bonds
decreased. This bond was sold at the end of the second quarter
1998 and a realized loss of $28.8 million
($18.7 million after-tax) was recorded. The other two bonds
are still owned by LNC and are producing net investment income
on an annual basis of $9.9 million ($6.4 million
after-tax). Subsequent to these transactions being recorded, the
Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board reached consensus with regard to accounting for this type
of investment strategy. LNC is not required to apply the new
accounting rules, however, if such rules were applied, the
realized loss on the sale of

$28.8 million ($18.7 million after-tax)
on one of these bonds recorded at the end of the second quarter
of 1998 would be reduced to $8.8 million ($5.7 million
after-tax) and the difference would be applied as a change in
the carrying amount of the two bonds that remain in LNC’s
portfolio. Also, net investment income for the year ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 would be less than
reported by $2.9 million ($1.9 million after-tax),
$2.7 million ($1.8 million after-tax) and
$2.5 million ($1.6 million after-tax), respectively.

The balance sheet captions, “Real
Estate” and “Property and Equipment,” are shown
net of allowances for depreciation as follows:

Impaired mortgage loans along with the related
allowance for losses are as follows:

The allowance for losses is maintained at a level
believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable
credit losses. Management’s periodic evaluation of the
adequacy of the allowance for losses is based on LNC’s past
loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio,
adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability
to repay (including the timing of future payments), the
estimated value of the underlying collateral, composition of the
loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant
factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it
requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows
expected to be received on impaired loans that may be
susceptible to significant change.

A reconciliation of the mortgage loan allowance
for losses for these impaired mortgage loans is as follows:

The average recorded investment in impaired
mortgage loans and the interest income recognized on impaired
mortgage loans were as follows:

All interest income on impaired mortgage loans
was recognized on the cash basis of income recognition.



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, LNC had
mortgage loans on non-accrual status of $1.8 million and
$0.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2002
and 2001, LNC had no mortgage loans past due 90 days and
still accruing.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, LNC had
restructured mortgage loans of $4.6 million and
$5.2 million, respectively. LNC recorded $0.4 million
and $0.5 million of interest income on these restructured
mortgage loans in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest income
in the amount of $0.4 million and $0.5 million would
have been recorded on these mortgage loans according to their
original terms in 2002 and 2001, respectively. As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, LNC had no outstanding
commitments to lend funds on restructured mortgage loans.

As of December 31, 2002, LNC’s
investment commitments for fixed maturity securities (primarily
private placements), mortgage loans on real estate and real
estate were $558.9 million. This includes
$168.1 million of standby commitments to purchase real
estate upon completion and leasing.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, fixed
maturity securities available-for-sale, mortgage loans on real
estate and real estate investments which were non-income
producing were not significant. As of December 31, 2002 and
2001, the carrying value of non-income producing securities was
$37.3 million and $32.4 million, respectively.

The balance sheet account for other liabilities
includes a reserve for guarantees of third-party debt in the
amount of $0.4 million and $0.3 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, LNC completed
a securitization of commercial mortgage loans. In the aggregate,
the loans had a fair value of $186.0 million and carrying
value of $185.7 million. LNC retained a 6.3% beneficial
interest in the securitized assets. LNC received
$172.7 million from the trust for the sale of the senior
trust certificates representing the other 93.7% beneficial
interest. A realized gain of $0.4 million pre-tax was
recorded on this sale. A recourse liability was not recorded
since LNC is not obligated to repurchase any loans from the
trust that may later become delinquent. Cash flows received
during 2002, 2001 and 2000 from interests retained in the trust
were $2.6 million, $2.6 million and $0.4 million,
respectively. The fair values of the mortgage loans were based
on a discounted cash flow method based on credit rating,
maturity and future income. Prepayments are expected to be less
than 1% with an expected weighted-average life of
6.4 years. Credit losses are anticipated to be minimal over
the life of the trust.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, LNC completed
a second securitization of commercial mortgage loans. In the
aggregate, the loans had a fair value of $209.7 million and
a carrying value of $198.1 million. LNC received
$209.7 million from the trust for the sale of the loans. A
recourse liability was not recorded since LNC is not obligated
to repurchase any loans from the trust that may later become
delinquent. Servicing fees of $0.2 million and
$0.03 million were received in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The transaction was hedged with total return swaps to lock in
the value of the loans. LNC recorded a loss on the hedge of
$10.1 million pre-tax and a realized gain on the sale of
$11.6 million pre-tax resulting in a net gain of
$1.5 million pre-tax. Upon securitization, LNC did not
retain an interest in the securitized assets; however, LNC later
invested $14.3 million of its general account assets in the
certificates issued by the trust. This investment is included in
fixed maturity securities on the balance sheet.

4.     Federal Income
Taxes

The Federal income tax expense (benefit) is as
follows:

The effective tax rate on pre-tax income is lower
than the prevailing corporate Federal Income tax rate. A
reconciliation of this difference is as follows:

The effective tax rate is a ratio of tax expense
over pre-tax income. Since the pre-tax income of
$1.6 million resulted in a tax benefit of
$90.0 million in 2002, an unusual effective tax rate of
(5,558)% is reported.

The Federal income tax asset (liability) is
as follows:



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Significant components of LNC’s deferred tax
assets and liabilities are as follows:

Cash paid for Federal income taxes in 2002 and
2001 was $382.9 million and $57.6 million,
respectively. Cash received for Federal income taxes in 2000 was
$79.1 million due to the carry back of 1999 tax losses.

LNC is required to establish a valuation
allowance for any gross deferred tax assets that are unlikely to
reduce taxes payable in future years’ tax returns. At
December 31, 2002, LNC believes that it is more likely than
not that all gross deferred tax assets will reduce taxes payable
in future years except for the amount of the valuation allowance
established in 2001. In 2001, LNC established a valuation
allowance of $51.2 million for the gross deferred tax
assets relating to net operating losses of its remaining foreign
life reinsurance subsidiary, Lincoln National Reinsurance
Company (Barbados) (“LNR Barbados”). The net operating
losses of LNR Barbados are subject to Federal income tax
limitations that only allow the net operating losses to be used
to offset future taxable income of the subsidiary. Due to the
disposition of its reinsurance operations, LNC believes that it
is more likely than not that LNC will not realize all of the tax
benefits associated with LNR Barbados’ net operating
losses. Because LNC has been required to defer recognition of
the gain on the portion of the disposition of its reinsurance
operation that was structured as indemnity reinsurance, the
establishment of this valuation allowance was recorded as a
decrease in the after-tax amount of the reinsurance deferred
gain carried on LNC’s consolidated balance sheet.

Since LNC made the decision in 1999 not to
permanently reinvest Lincoln UK’s earnings in Lincoln UK,
the U.S. tax rules rather than UK tax rules are the primary
factor in determining the deferred taxes for the segment. In
2002, LNC established $16.4 million of deferred taxes
relating to the segment.

At December 31, 2002, LNC had net operating
loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of:
$290.0 million for LNR Barbados that expire in the years
2014, 2016 and 2017 and $31.7 million for Lincoln
Life & Annuity Company of New York that expire in the
year 2013. LNC also had net capital loss carryforwards of
$156.2 million for The Lincoln National Life Insurance
Company and $7.4 million for First Penn-Pacific Life
Insurance Company that expire in the year 2007. Net capital
losses of $33.5 million for



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New
York will expire in years 2004 through 2007. Net capital losses
of $44.5 million for LNR Barbados will expire in the year
2007. In contrast to the net operating losses of LNR Barbados,
the net capital losses can be used in future LNC consolidated
U.S. tax returns. Accordingly, LNC believes that it is more
likely than not that the capital losses will be fully utilized
within the allowable carryforward period.

Under prior Federal income tax law, one-half of
the excess of a life insurance company’s income from
operations over its taxable investment income was not taxed, but
was set aside in a special tax account designated as
“Policyholders’ Surplus.” At December 31,
2002, LNC has approximately $196.0 million of untaxed
“Policyholders’ Surplus” on which no payment of
Federal income taxes will be required unless it is distributed
as a dividend, or under other specified conditions. Barring the
passage of unfavorable tax legislation, LNC does not believe
that any significant portion of the account will be taxed in the
foreseeable future. Accordingly, no deferred tax liability has
been recognized relating to LNC’s Policyholders’
Surplus balance. If the entire Policyholders’ Surplus
balance became taxable at the current Federal rate, the tax
would be approximately $68.6 million.

respectively.

Detailed below is a breakdown of amounts included
in LNC’s balance sheet related to the reinsurance business
sold to Swiss Re through indemnity reinsurance. Because LNC is
not relieved of its liability to the ceding companies for this
business, the liabilities and obligations associated with the
reinsured contracts remain on the consolidated balance sheet of
LNC with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from Swiss Re.
In addition, a portion of the business has been reinsured on a
funds withheld basis. This means that LNC

transferred reserves for the reinsurance business
to Swiss Re, but LNC continues to hold assets in support of
those reserves. The payable to Swiss Re related to the assets is

LNC also has access to capital from minority
interest in preferred securities of subsidiary companies. Hybrid
securities currently outstanding, which combine debt and equity
characteristics, were offered through a series of subsidiaries
(Lincoln National Capital III, IV and V). These
subsidiaries were formed solely for the purpose of issuing
preferred securities and lending the proceeds to LNC. The common
securities of these subsidiaries are owned by LNC. The only
assets of Lincoln National Capital III, IV, and V are the
notes receivable from LNC for such loans. Distributions are paid
by these subsidiaries to the preferred securityholders on a
quarterly basis. The principal obligations of these subsidiaries
are irrevocably guaranteed by LNC. Upon liquidation of these
subsidiaries, the holders of the preferred securities would be
entitled to a fixed amount per share plus accumulated and unpaid
distributions. LNC reserves the right to: 1) redeem the
preferred securities at a fixed price plus accumulated and
unpaid distributions and; 2) extend the stated redemption
date up to 19 years if certain conditions are met.

In August 1998, Lincoln National Capital IV
issued 9,200,000 shares or $230 million of 7.75%
FELINE PRIDES (service mark of Merrill Lynch & Co.
Inc.). The purchasers of such securities were also provided
stock purchase contract agreements that indicated they would
receive a specified amount of LNC common stock on or before the
August 2001 maturity date of the FELINE PRIDES. A portion of the
issuance costs associated with this offering along with the
present value of the payments associated with the stock purchase
agreements were charged to the common stock line within
shareholders’ equity.

On August 16, 2001, LNC settled mandatory
stock purchase contracts issued in conjunction with the FELINE
PRIDES financing. This action resulted in the issuance of
4,630,318 shares of LNC stock at $49.67 per share.
Investors had the option of settling the purchase contract with
separate cash or by having the collateral securing their
purchase obligations sold. In the case of investors who held the
Trust Originated Preferred Securities (“TOPrS”) as
collateral for the purchase contracts, they were permitted to
enter into a remarketing process with proceeds used to settle
the contracts. On August 13, 2001, the remarketing failed
resulting in the retirement of $225 million TOPrS. A total
of $5 million of two-year TOPrS remain outstanding which
represents investors who chose to settle with separate cash and
hold onto their TOPrS until maturity.

In September 2001, LNC redeemed $215 million
8.75% Quarterly Income Preferred Securities which were issued by
Lincoln National Capital I in July 1996. In November 2001,
Lincoln National Capital V issued 6,900,000 shares of
$172.5 million 7.65% Trust Preferred Securities
(“TRUPS”). In conjunction with the $172.5 million
TRUPS issue, LNC executed an interest rate swap in the amount of
172.5 million notional that effectively converted the 7.65%
fixed rate into a LIBOR-based floating interest rate.

In December 2001, LNC issued $250 million
6.20% ten-year senior notes. In January 2002, LNC redeemed
$100 million 8.35% TOPrS which were issued by Lincoln
Capital II in August 1996. In June 2002, LNC issued
$250 million 5.25% five-year senior notes. In conjunction
with the $250 million debt issue, LNC executed an interest
rate swap in the amount of 100 million notional that
effectively converted the 5.25% fixed rate coupon on that
portion of the bond into LIBOR-based floating rate debt.

In April 2002, a new shelf registration statement
was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The new shelf registration totaled $1.2 billion
(including $402.5 million of registered but unissued
securities from previous registration statements). After giving
consideration to the $250 million 5.25% five-year senior
notes issued in June 2002, LNC has $950 million remaining
under the shelf registration to issue debt securities, preferred
stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts and
stock purchase units of LNC and trust preferred securities of
four subsidiary trusts. The net proceeds from the sale of the
securities offered by this shelf registration and the applicable
prospectus supplement(s) are expected to be used by LNC for
general corporate purposes, including repurchases of outstanding
common stock, repayment or redemption of outstanding debt or
preferred stock, the possible acquisition of financial services
businesses or assets thereof, investment in portfolio assets and
working capital needs.

Finally, LNC maintains three revolving credit
agreements with a group of domestic and foreign banks totaling
$580 million. One agreement, in the amount of
$300 million, expires in December 2005 and the second
agreement, in the amount of $200 million, expires in
December 2003. The third agreement, in the amount of
$80 million, is maintained by Lincoln UK and expired in
January 2003. The Lincoln UK agreement was renewed in January
2003 for $48 million maturing in January 2004. All three
agreements provide for interest on borrowings based on various
money market indices. Under all three agreements, LNC must
maintain senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of at least
S&P A- and Moody’s A3 or be restricted by an adjusted
debt to capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2002, LNC had
$11.9 million in outstanding borrowings under the Lincoln
UK agreement. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, fees paid for
maintaining revolving credit agreements amounted to
$0.55 million, $0.65 million and $0.64 million,
respectively.

6.     Employee
Benefit Plans

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit
Plans — U.S.

LNC maintains
funded defined benefit pension plans for most of its
U.S. employees and, prior to January 1, 1995, most
full-time agents. Effective January 1, 2002, the
employees’ pension plan has a cash balance formula.
Employees retiring before 2012 will have their benefits
calculated under both the old and new formulas and will receive
the better of the two calculations. Employees retiring in 2012
or after will receive benefits under the amended plan. Benefits
under the old employees’ plan are based on total years of
service and the highest 60 months of compensation during the
last 10 years of employment. Under the amended plan,
employees have guaranteed account balances that grow with pay
and interest credits each year. The amendment to the
employees’ pension plan resulted in a $27.8 million
pre-tax negative unrecognized prior service cost in 2001 that
will be evenly recognized over future periods. All benefits
applicable to the defined benefit plan for agents were frozen as
of December 31, 1994. The plans are funded by contributions
to tax-exempt trusts. LNC’s funding policy is consistent
with the funding requirements of Federal law and regulations.
Contributions are intended to provide not only the benefits
attributed to service to date, but also those expected to be
earned in the future.

LNC sponsors three types of unfunded,
nonqualified, defined benefit plans for certain
U.S. employees and agents: supplemental retirement plans, a
salary continuation plan, and supplemental executive retirement
plans.

The supplemental retirement plans provide defined
benefit pension benefits in excess of limits imposed by Federal
tax law. Effective January 1, 2000, one of these plans was
amended to limit the maximum compensation recognized for benefit
payment calculation purposes. The effect of this amendment was
to reduce the pension benefit obligation by $5.4 million.

The salary continuation plan provides certain
officers of LNC defined pension benefits based on years of
service and final monthly salary upon death or retirement.

The supplemental executive retirement plan
provides defined pension benefits for certain executives who
became employees of LNC as a result of the acquisition of a
block of individual life insurance and annuity business from
CIGNA Corporation (“CIGNA”). Effective January 1,
2000, this plan was amended to freeze benefits payable under
this plan. The effect of this plan curtailment was to decrease
the pension benefit obligation by $2.4 million. Effective
January 1, 2000, a second supplemental executive retirement
plan was established for this same group of executives to
guarantee that the total benefit payable under the LNC
employees’ defined benefit pension plan benefit formula
will be determined using an average compensation not less than
the minimum three-year average compensation as of
December 31, 1999. All benefits payable from this plan are
reduced by benefits payable from the LNC employees’ defined
benefit pension plan.

LNC also sponsors unfunded plans that provide
postretirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits to
full-time U.S. employees and agents who, depending on the
plan, have worked for LNC 10 years and attained age 55
(60 for agents). Medical and dental benefits are also available
to spouses and other dependents of employees and agents. For
medical and dental benefits, limited contributions are required
from individuals who retired prior to November 1, 1988.
Contributions for later retirees, which can be adjusted
annually, are based on such items as years of service at
retirement and age at retirement. Life insurance benefits are
noncontributory; however, participants can elect supplemental
contributory life benefits up to age 70. Effective
July 1, 1999, the agents’ postretirement plan was
changed to require agents retiring on or after that date to pay
the full medical and dental premium costs. This change in the
plan resulted in a one-time curtailment gain of
$10.2 million pre-tax. Beginning January 1, 2002, the
employees’ postretirement plan was changed to require
employees not yet age 50 with five years of service by year
end 2001 to pay the full medical and dental



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

premium cost when they retire. This change in the
plan resulted in the immediate recognition at the end of 2001 of
a one-time curtailment gain of $11.3 million pre-tax.

On December 1, 2001, Swiss Re acquired
LNC’s reinsurance business. This transaction resulted in
the immediate recognition of a one-time curtailment gain on post
retirement benefits of $6 million pre-tax and additional
expense of $1.4 million pre-tax related to pension benefits
for a net curtailment gain of $4.6 million pre-tax. This
net curtailment gain was included in the realized gain on sale
of subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2001. Due
to the release of the pension obligations on these former LNC
employees, there was a $16 million gain in the pension plan
that was used to offset prior plan losses.

Information with respect to defined benefit plan
asset activity and defined benefit plan obligations is as
follows:

In 2002, all plans have projected benefit
obligations in excess of plan assets. In 2001, the funded status
amounts in the pension benefits columns above combine plans with
projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and plans
with plan assets in excess of projected benefit obligations. At
December 31, 2001, for plans that had projected benefit
obligations in excess of plan assets, the aggregate projected
benefit obligations



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

were $400.1 million, the aggregate
accumulated benefit obligations were $373.0 million and the
aggregate fair value of plan assets was $314.9 million.

As required by Statement of Financial Accountant
Standards No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for
Pensions,” for plans where the accumulated benefit
obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, LNC has
recognized the minimum pension liability of the unfunded
accumulated benefit obligation as a liability with an offsetting
adjustment to Other Comprehensive Income, net of tax impact. As
of December 31, 2002, this minimum pension liability
amounted to $64.8 million ($99.7 million pre-tax) for
U.S. pension plans. In addition, as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, for the non-U.S. defined benefit plan, a
minimum pension liability of $33.0 million
($50.9 million pre-tax) and $36.0 million,
respectively, was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income (see below for further discussion of the
non-U.S. defined benefit plan). The total amount recorded
in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $97.8 million and
$36.0 million, respectively.

Plan assets for both the funded employees and
agents plans are principally invested in equity and fixed income
funds managed by LNC’s Investment Management segment.

The components of net defined benefit pension
plan and postretirement benefit plan costs are as follows:

The calculation of the accumulated postretirement
benefits obligation assumes a weighted-average annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (i.e. health
care cost trend rate) of 10.0% for 2002. It further assumes the
rate will gradually decrease to 5.0% by 2014 and remain at that
level. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a
significant effect on the amounts reported. For example,
increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one
percentage point each year would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefits obligation as of December 31, 2002
and 2001 by $7.5 million and $6.8 million,
respectively. The aggregate of the estimated service and
interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefits
cost for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 would
increase by $0.6 million and $0.8 million,
respectively.

LNC maintains a defined contribution plan for its
U.S. insurance agents. Contributions to this plan are based
on a percentage of the agents’ annual compensation as
defined in the plan. Effective January 1, 1998, LNC assumed
the liabilities for a non-contributory defined contribution plan
covering certain highly compensated former CIGNA agents and
employees. Contributions for this plan are made annually based
upon varying percentages of annual eligible earnings as defined
in the plan. Contributions to this plan are in lieu of any
contributions to the qualified agent defined contribution plan.
Effective January 1, 2000, this plan was expanded to
include certain highly compensated Lincoln agents. The combined
pre-tax expenses for these plans amounted to $1.0 million,
$2.8 million and $4.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. These expenses reflect both LNC’s
contribution as well as changes in the measurement of LNC’s
liabilities under these plans.

Pension Plan — Non
U.S.

The employees of LNC’s
primary foreign subsidiary are covered by a defined benefit
pension plan. The plan provides death and pension benefits based
on final pensionable salary. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
plan assets were under the projected benefit obligations by
$62.7 million and $47.0 million, respectively, and was
included in other liabilities in LNC’s balance sheet. As a
result of the accumulated benefit obligation being in excess of
plan assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001, a minimum
pension liability adjustment of $33.0 million
($50.9 million pre-tax) and $36.0 million,
respectively, was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income in equity. There was no tax recorded on the minimum
pension liability adjustment in 2001. Net pension costs for the
foreign plan were $10.0 million, $7.4 million and
$4.4 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

401(k), Money Purchase and Profit Sharing
Plans.

LNC also sponsors contributory
defined contribution plans for eligible U.S. employees and
agents. These plans include 401(k) plans and effective
April 1, 2001, a defined contribution money purchase plan
for eligible employees of Delaware Management Holdings, Inc.
(“Holdings”). Prior to April 1, 2001, the defined
contribution money purchase plan was structured as a profit
sharing plan. LNC’s contributions to the 401(k) plans are
equal to participant’s pre-tax contribution, not to exceed
6% of base pay, multiplied by a percentage, ranging from 50% to
150%, which varies according to certain incentive criteria as
determined by LNC’s Board of Directors. As a result of LNC
attaining the goals established under the three-year long-term
incentive plan for 1998 through 2000, an additional match was
made on a participant’s 2000 pre-tax contribution.

LNC’s contribution to the defined
contribution money purchase plan is equal to 7.5% per annum
of a participant’s eligible compensation, while its
contribution to the previous profit sharing plan of Holdings was
equal to an amount, if any, determined in accordance with a
resolution of the Board of Directors. Each plan year’s
contribution is allocated in the proportion that the plan
compensation of each eligible participant bears to the total
plan compensation of all eligible participants for such plan
year. Compensation is defined as all of an eligible
participant’s plan year earnings and is subject to the
limitation of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended. For 2002 and 2001, the contribution to the
defined contribution money purchase plan was based on 7.5% of
the eligible compensation for the year ended December 31,
2002 and for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2001,
respectively. For the profit sharing plan’s fiscal years
ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, the Board issued a
resolution authorizing a 15% per annum contribution to the
plan. Expense for the 401(k) and profit sharing plans amounted
to $22.6 million, $27.0 million and $43.5 million
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans.

LNC sponsors contributory deferred
compensation plans for certain U.S. employees and agents.
Plan participants may elect to defer payment of a portion of
their compensation, as defined by the plans. At this point, LNC
has not chosen to fund these plans. Plan participants may select
from a variety of alternative measures for purposes of
calculating the investment return considered attributable to
their deferral. Under the terms of these plans, LNC agrees to
pay out amounts based upon the alternative measure selected by
the participant. Plan participants who are also participants in
an LNC 401(k) plan and who have reached the contribution limit
for that plan may also elect to defer the additional amounts
into the deferred compensation plan. LNC makes matching
contributions to these plans based upon amounts placed into the
deferred compensation plans by individuals who have reached the
contribution limit under the 401(k) plan. The amount of
LNC’s contribution is calculated in a manner similar to the
employer match calculation described in the 401(k) plans section
above. Expense for these plans amounted to $1.7 million,
$0.6 million and $4.3 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. These expenses reflect both LNC’s employer
matching contributions, as well as changes in the measurement of
LNC’s liabilities under these plans.

In the fourth quarter of 1999, LNC modified the
terms of the deferred compensation plans to provide that plan
participants who selected LNC stock as the measure for their
investment return would receive shares of LNC stock in
satisfaction of this portion of their deferral. In addition,
participants were precluded from diversifying any portion of
their deferred compensation plan account that is measured by
LNC’s stock

performance. As a result of these modifications
to the plans, ongoing changes in value of LNC’s stock no
longer affect the expenses associated with this portion of the
deferred compensation plans.

In connection with the acquisition of the block
of individual life insurance and annuity business from CIGNA,
LNC assumed the liability for an unfunded contributory deferred
compensation plan covering certain former CIGNA employees and
agents. These participants became immediately eligible for the
LNC contributory deferred compensation plans, and therefore this
plan was frozen as to future deferrals as of January 1,
1998. Effective January 1, 2001, this frozen plan was
merged into the LNC contributory deferred compensation plans and
the associated expenses for 2002, 2001 and 2000 are included in
those plan expenses disclosed above.

The total liabilities associated with these plans
were $161.3 million and $149.5 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Incentive Plans.

LNC
has various incentive plans for employees, agents and directors
of LNC and its subsidiaries that provide for the issuance of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
awards and stock incentive awards. These plans are comprised
primarily of stock option incentive plans. Stock options awarded
under the stock option incentive plans are granted with an
exercise price equal to the market value of LNC stock at the
date of grant and, subject to termination of employment, expire
10 years from the date of grant. Such options are
transferable only upon death. Options become exercisable in 25%
increments over the four-year period following the option grant
anniversary date. A “reload option” feature was added
on May 14, 1997. In most cases, persons exercising an
option after that date have been granted new options in an
amount equal to the number of matured shares tendered to
exercise the original option award. The reload options are
granted for the remaining term of the related original option
and have an exercise price equal to the market value of LNC
stock at the date of the reload award. Reload options can be
exercised two years after the grant date if the value of the new
option has appreciated by at least 25%.

In 2000, as a result of changes in the
interpretation of the existing accounting rules for stock
options, LNC decided not to continue issuing stock options to
agents that do not meet the stringent definition of a common law
employee. In the first quarter of 2000, LNC adopted a stock
appreciation right (“SAR”) program as a replacement to
the agent stock option program. The first awards under this
program were also made in the first quarter of 2000. The SARs
under this program are rights on LNC stock that are cash settled
and become exercisable in 25% increments over the four year
period following the SAR grant date. SARs are granted with an
exercise price equal to the market value of LNC stock at the
date of grant and, subject to termination of employment, expire
five years from the date of grant. Such SARs are transferable
only upon death.

LNC recognizes compensation expense for the SAR
program based on the fair value method using an option-pricing
model. Compensation expense and the related liability are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of
the SARs. The SAR liability is marked-to-market through net
income. This accounting treatment causes volatility in net
income as a result of changes in the market value of LNC stock.
LNC hedges this volatility by purchasing call options on LNC
stock. Call options hedging vested SARs are also
marked-to-market through net income. Total compensation expense
(income) recognized for the SAR program for 2002, 2001 and 2000
was $(0.7) million, $4.8 million and
$3.1 million, respectively. The mark-to-market gain (loss)
recognized through net income on the call options on LNC stock
for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $(6.7) million,
$0.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The SAR
liability at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was
$3.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively.

In 2001, Holdings, through its wholly-owned
subsidiaries Delaware Investments U.S., Inc. (“DIUS”)
and DIAL Holding Company, Inc. (“DIAL”), established
separate stock option incentive plans for its domestic and
international personnel, respectively. Stock options awarded
under the plans are granted with an exercise price equal to the
estimated fair market value per share at the date of the grant,
as determined by an



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

outside appraiser, and expire 10 years from
the date of the grant, subject to conditions of the plan
agreements. Options granted under the DIUS plan become
exercisable and vest in 25% increments over the four-year period
following the option grant anniversary date. Options granted
under the DIAL plan also vest in 25% increments over the
four-year period following the option grant anniversary date,
however, such options are exercisable immediately. In the event
DIAL options are exercised prior to vesting, such stock acquired
is restricted from resale until vested under the option terms.

Shares acquired upon exercise, provided they have
been held for more than six months and are vested, may be
“put” to Holdings at the most recent determined fair
market value per share, subject to the specific terms of the
plan agreements. Fair market value is determined on a
semi-annual basis by the outside appraiser. Additionally, shares
acquired upon exercise, provided they have been held for more
than six months and are vested, may be “called” by
Holdings, DIUS or DIAL, as applicable, at the most recent
determined fair market value per share.

Through 2002, LNC recognized compensation expense
for its stock option incentive plans using the intrinsic value
method of accounting and provides the required pro forma
information for stock options granted after December 31,
1994. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized
for stock option incentive plans. LNC’s pro forma net
income and earnings per diluted share for the last three years
(2002, 2001 and 2000) would have been $56.6 million
($0.31 per diluted share); $549.2 million
($2.84 per diluted share) and $588.3 million
($3.02 per diluted share), respectively (a decrease of
$35.0 million or $0.19 per diluted share;
$41.0 million or $0.21 per diluted share and
$33.1 million or $0.17 per diluted share,
respectively). Included in this pro forma information is the
following effect of the DIUS and DIAL stock option incentive
plans.

If compensation expense for the DIUS and DIAL
stock option incentive plans had been determined based on the
estimated fair value at the grant dates for awards under those
plans, LNC’s net income and earnings per share for 2002 and
2001 would have been further reduced by $8.2 million
($0.04 per diluted share) and $1.9 million
($0.01 per diluted share), respectively.

These effects on pro forma net income and
earnings per share of expensing the estimated fair value of
stock options are not necessarily representative of the effects
on reported net income for future years due to factors such as
the vesting period of the stock options and the potential for
issuance of additional stock options in future years.

The fair value of options used as a basis for the
pro forma disclosures, shown above, was estimated as of the date
of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Included in
the above pro forma decrease in net income for 2001 was
$6.1 million after-tax of stock option expense related to
the former Reinsurance segment.

On August 8, 2002, LNC announced plans to
expense the fair value of employee stock options beginning in
2003 under FAS 123. FAS 148, issued on
December 31, 2002, provides for alternative methods of
transition for entities that change to the fair value method of
accounting for stock-based compensation. On January 1,
2003, LNC will adopt the retroactive restatement method under
FAS 148, which requires that companies restate all periods
presented to reflect stock-based employee compensation cost
under the fair value accounting method in FAS 123 for all
employee awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994. LNC will present
restated financial statements for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000
in its first quarter 2003 filing on Form 10-Q

Effective January 1, 2003, LNC’s stock
option employee compensation plan and long-term cash incentive
compensation plan were revised and combined to provide for
performance vesting, and to provide for awards that may be paid
out in a combination of stock options, performance shares of LNC
stock and cash. The performance measures for the initial grant
under the new plan will be calculated over a three-year period
from grant date and will compare LNC’s performance relative
to a selected group of peer companies. Comparative performance
measures will include relative growth in earnings per share,
return on equity and total share

performance. Certain participants in the new
plans will select from seven different combinations of stock
options, performance shares and or cash in determining the form
of their award. Other participants will have their award paid in
performance shares. This plan will replace the current LNC stock
option plan; however, the separate stock option incentive plans
established by DIUS and DIAL, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of
Delaware Management Holdings, Inc., will continue.

Statutory
Information and Restrictions

Net income (loss) as determined in accordance
with statutory accounting practices for LNC’s insurance
subsidiaries excluding the insurance subsidiaries sold to Swiss
Re in 2001 was $(0.159) billion, $0.268 billion and
$0.547 billion for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. On
December 7, 2001, Swiss Re acquired LNC’s reinsurance
operations. The transaction structure involved a series of
indemnity reinsurance transactions combined with the sale of
certain stock companies that comprised LNC’s reinsurance
operation. See Note 11 for further discussion of Swiss
Re’s acquisition of LNC’s reinsurance operations. All
of LNC’s foreign life reinsurance companies were sold to
Swiss Re on December 7, 2001 except Lincoln National
Reinsurance Company (Barbados) and Lincoln Re (Ireland) Limited.
In the second quarter of 2002, LNC exercised a contractual right
to “put” its interest in Lincoln Re (Ireland) Limited
to Swiss Re.



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

Shareholders’ equity as determined in
accordance with statutory accounting practices for LNC’s
insurance subsidiaries was $3.0 billion and
$3.8 billion for December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

The National Association of Insurance
Commissioners revised the Accounting Practices and Procedures
Manual in a process referred to as Codification. The revised
manual became effective January 1, 2001. The domiciliary
states of LNC’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries have
adopted the provisions of the revised manual. The revised manual
has changed, to some extent, prescribed statutory accounting
practices and has resulted in changes to the accounting
practices that LNC’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries use
to prepare their statutory-basis financial statements. The
impact of these changes to LNC and its U.S. insurance
subsidiaries’ statutory-based capital and surplus as of
January 1, 2001 was not significant.

LNC’s primary insurance subsidiary, The
Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”)
acquired a block of individual life insurance and annuity
business from CIGNA in January 1998 and a block of individual
life insurance from Aetna Inc. in October 1998. These
acquisitions were structured as indemnity reinsurance
transactions. The statutory accounting regulations do not allow
goodwill to be recognized on indemnity reinsurance transactions
and therefore, the related statutory ceding commission flows
through the statement of operations as an expense resulting in a
reduction of statutory earned surplus. As a result of these
acquisitions, LNL’s statutory earned surplus was negative.

LNC’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to
certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the
transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding
company. Generally, these restrictions pose no short-term
liquidity concerns for the holding company. As a result of
negative statutory earned surplus, LNL was required to obtain
the prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner
(“Commissioner”) before paying any dividends to LNC
until its statutory earned surplus became positive. During the
first quarter of 2002, LNL received approval from the
Commissioner to reclassify total dividends of $495 million
paid to LNC in 2001 from LNL’s earned surplus to
paid-in-capital. This change plus the increase in statutory
earned surplus from the disposition of LNC’s reinsurance
operations through an indemnity reinsurance transaction with
Swiss Re resulted in positive statutory earned surplus for LNL
at December 31, 2001.

In general, dividends are not subject to prior
approval from the Commissioner provided LNL’s statutory
earned surplus is positive and such dividends do not exceed the
standard limitation of the greater of 10% of total statutory
earned surplus or the amount of statutory earnings in the prior
calendar year. Dividends of $710 million were paid by LNL
to LNC in the second quarter of 2002. These distributions were
made in two installments. The first installment of
$60 million was paid in April. The second installment of
$650 million was paid in June. As both installments
exceeded the standard limitation noted above, a special request
was made for each payment and each was approved by the
Commissioner. Both distributions represented a portion of the
proceeds received from the indemnity reinsurance transaction
with Swiss Re. As a result of the payment of dividends plus the
statutory loss in 2002, LNL’s statutory earned surplus is
negative as of December 31, 2002. Due to the negative
statutory earned surplus as of December 31, 2002, any
dividend(s) paid by LNL in 2003 will be subject to prior
approval from the Commissioner. As occurred in 2001, dividends
approved and paid while statutory earned surplus is negative are
expected to be classified as a reduction to paid-in-capital.

LNL is recognized as an accredited reinsurer in
the state of New York, which effectively enables it to conduct
reinsurance business with unrelated insurance companies that are
domiciled within the state of New York. As a result, in addition
to regulatory restrictions imposed by the state of Indiana, LNL
is also subject to the regulatory requirements that the State of
New York imposes upon accredited reinsurers.

Divestitures,” for discussion of contingencies surrounding

United Kingdom Selling
    Practices

Various selling practices of the Lincoln UK
operations have come under scrutiny by the U.K. regulators at
different times in the recent past. These selling practices
include the sale and administration of individual pension
products, mortgage endowments and the selling practices of City
Financial Partners Limited (“CFPL”), a subsidiary
company purchased in December 1997. Regarding the sale and
administration of pension products to individuals, regulatory
agencies have raised questions as to what constitutes
appropriate advice to individuals who bought pension products as
an alternative to participation in an employer-sponsored plan.
In cases of alleged inappropriate advice, an extensive
investigation has been or is being carried out and the
individual put in a position similar to what would have been
attained if the individual had remained in an employer-sponsored
plan.

With regard to mortgage endowments, on
November 30, 2000, U.K. regulators issued a paper
containing draft guidelines explaining how mortgage endowment
policyholders would be compensated in instances where it is
determined that mis-selling occurred. This release also
indicated that an extensive analysis is underway of mortgage
endowment products offered by insurance companies in the U.K.
marketplace since 1988. Where the results of this analysis
indicate that products are designed in a way that could lead to
potential mis-selling, U.K. regulators are contacting companies
to review sales practices. Subsequently, further guidance has
been issued by the U.K. regulators to clarify the treatment of
complaints concerning the sale of these products.

Lincoln UK received a letter from U.K. regulators
on February 8, 2001, raising concerns with certain mortgage
endowment products sold by British National Life Assurance
Company (“BNLA”). The specific policies at issue were
sold between the period of July 1988 through March 1994. Lincoln
UK acquired BNLA from Citibank in August of 1993. Less than
6,000 of these BNLA policies remain in force.

In their letter and in subsequent discussions,
U.K. regulators are contending that BNLA’s sales literature
was written in a manner that provides a contractual warranty
that, if certain assumptions are achieved, the mortgage
endowment would grow to a balance sufficient to repay the
contractholder’s mortgage. LNC strongly disagrees that any
contractual warranties were made in the sale of these mortgage
endowment policies. In August of 2001, LNC reaffirmed its
position in a letter to the UK regulators.

In March of 2002, LNC received a letter saying
that the U.K. regulators had appointed enforcement investigators
to review BNLA’s charging structure. This change was not a
result of anything LNC had done to resolve this matter, but was
a formality according to the U.K. regulators, reflecting how
they wish to proceed with these matters across the entire
industry. They want to obtain more information to be able to
understand the background of the arguments. Accordingly, LNC has
provided a significant amount of data about BNLA mortgage
endowments and their charging structure. On May 31, 2002,
the U.K. regulator wrote to LNC informing them that enforcement
investigations had been completed and suggesting a meeting
between the parties’ leading counsel to try to resolve the
issues. This meeting has taken place but agreement was not
reached. LNC is prepared to proceed with all available means of
resolution, including pursuing regulatory, administrative and
legal means of concluding this matter.

On March 20, 2002, the U.K. regulator wrote
to LNC expressing the opinion that Laurentian Life, Liberty Life
(acquired by Lincoln UK in January and April 1995, respectively)
and Lincoln UK had in some cases calculated premiums for certain
endowment mortgage policies issued between July 1988 and October
2000 based upon growth rates that were, for that time, unduly
optimistic, creating exceptional risks for consumers. LNC has
reviewed a sample of the Liberty Life policies and based on the
results of this review, LNC and the regulators have agreed that
no further action is required on the Liberty Life policies
unless additional information is discovered. Discussions
continue on the Laurentian Life and Lincoln UK blocks of
business.

Following allegations made by the U.K.
Consumers’ Association (an organization which acts on
behalf of consumers of goods and services provided in the U.K.)
concerning various selling practices of CFPL, LNC



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

conducted an internal review of 5,000 ten-year
savings plans sold by CFPL during the period September 1,
1998 to August 31, 2000 and, following discussions with the
U.K. regulator, LNC wrote to all customers with a ten-year
savings plan sold by CFPL to determine whether the sales of
those policies were appropriate. As of December 31, 2002,
the mailings were substantially complete.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the aggregate
liability associated with Lincoln UK selling practices was
$82.2 million and $164.3 million, respectively. The
decrease in the aggregate liability was a result of redress
payments and expenditures partially offset by exchange rate
fluctuation. The reserves for these issues are based on various
estimates that are subject to considerable uncertainty.
Accordingly, the aggregate liability may prove to be deficient
or excessive. However, it is management’s opinion that
future developments regarding Lincoln UK selling practices will
not materially affect the consolidated financial position of LNC.

Marketing and Compliance
    Issues

Regulators continue to focus on market conduct
and compliance issues. Under certain circumstances, companies
operating in the insurance and financial services markets have
been held responsible for providing incomplete or misleading
sales materials and for replacing existing policies with
policies that were less advantageous to the policyholder.
LNC’s management continues to monitor the company’s
sales materials and compliance procedures and is making an
extensive effort to minimize any potential liability. Due to the
uncertainty surrounding such matters, it is not possible to
provide a meaningful estimate of the range of potential outcomes
at this time; however, it is management’s opinion that such
future developments will not materially affect the consolidated
financial position of LNC.

Euro Conversion

LNC owns operating companies in the U.K. and
previously conducted business with companies located within
Europe. LNC has modified its systems, financial activities and
currency risk exposures to align with the first phase of the
European Union’s conversion to a new common currency (the
Euro) that was adopted January 1, 1999. On January 1,
2002, the Euro banknotes and coins were put into circulation. It
is management’s opinion that the additional phases of this
conversion, which will be implemented during the next few years,
will not materially affect the consolidated financial position
of LNC.

Leases

Certain of LNC’s subsidiaries lease their
home office properties through sale-leaseback agreements. The
agreements provide for a 25-year lease period with options to
renew for six additional terms of five years each. The
agreements also provide LNC with the right of the first refusal
to purchase the properties during the terms of the lease,
including renewal periods, at a price defined in the agreements.
LNC also has the option to purchase the leased properties at
fair market value as defined in the agreements on the last day
of the initial 25-year lease period ending in 2009 or the last
day of any of the renewal periods.

Total rental expense on operating leases in 2002,
2001 and 2000 was $67.0 million, $79.4 million and
$88.4 million, respectively. Future minimum rental
commitments are as follows (in millions):

Information Technology
    Commitment

In February 1998, LNL signed a seven-year
contract with IBM Global Services for information technology
services for the Fort Wayne operations. Annual costs are
dependent on usage but are expected to range from
$60.0 million to $70.0 million.

Lincoln UK Outsourcing
    Agreement

Lincoln UK agreed to outsource its customer and
policy administration functions to the Capita Group Plc
(“Capita”) on August 1, 2002. The contract is for
a term of 10 years and the annual cost is based on a per
policy charge plus an amount for other services provided. The
total costs over the life of the contract are estimated to be
$259.2 million and annual costs over the next five years
are estimated to decline from $33.3 million to
$26.7 million. The amounts quoted are estimates as the
actual cost will depend on the number of policies in force and
the applicable inflation rate for the period concerned. Lincoln
UK or Capita may terminate the contract, subject to the
necessary conditions being satisfied, by serving six and
12 months notice, respectively.

Football Stadium Naming Rights
    Commitment

On June 3, 2002, LNC announced an agreement
with the Philadelphia Eagles to name the Eagles’ new
stadium Lincoln Financial Field. In exchange for the naming
rights, LNC agreed to pay $139.6 million over a 20-year
period, through annual payments to the Eagles which average
approximately $6.7 million per year. The total amount
includes a maximum annual increase related to the Consumer Price
Index (“CPI”). This future commitment has not been
recorded as a liability on LNC’s balance sheet as it will
be accounted for in a manner consistent with the accounting for
operating leases under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.”

Insurance Ceded and Assumed

LNC’s insurance companies cede insurance to
other companies. The portion of risks exceeding each
company’s retention limit is reinsured with other insurers.
LNC seeks reinsurance coverage within the businesses that sell
life insurance to limit its liabilities. As of December 31,
2002, LNC’s retention policy was to retain no more than
$10 million on a single insured life. For 2003, the
retention policy was changed to limit retention on new sales to
$5 million. Portions of LNC’s deferred annuity
business have also been co-insured with other companies to limit
LNC’s exposure to interest rate risks. At December 31,
2002, the reserves associated with these reinsurance
arrangements totaled $2,009.0 million. To cover products
other than life insurance, LNC acquires other insurance
coverages with retentions and limits that management believes
are appropriate for the circumstances. The accompanying
financial statements reflect premiums, benefits and deferred
acquisition costs, net of insurance ceded (see Note 5).
LNC’s insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers
are unable to meet contractual obligations under applicable
reinsurance agreements.

Certain LNC insurance companies assume insurance
from other companies. At December 31, 2002, LNC’s
insurance companies provided $80.2 million of statutory
surplus relief to other insurance companies under reinsurance
transactions. Generally, such amounts are offset by
corresponding receivables from the ceding company, which are
secured by future profits on the reinsured business. However,
LNC’s insurance companies are subject to the risk that the
ceding company may become insolvent and the right of offset
would not be permitted. LNC’s reinsurance operations were
acquired by Swiss Re on December 7, 2001. The transaction
structure involved a series of indemnity reinsurance
transactions combined with the sale of certain stock companies
that comprised LNC’s reinsurance operation. Under the
indemnity reinsurance agreements, Swiss Re reinsured certain
liabilities and obligations of LNC. Because LNC is not relieved
of its legal liability to the ceding companies, the liabilities
and obligations associated with the reinsured contracts remain
on the balance sheets of LNC with a corresponding reinsurance
receivable from Swiss Re.

Letters of Credit

LNC maintains $450 million in bank
agreements to issue standby letters of credit on behalf of
subsidiaries of LNC and for the benefit of third parties. These
letters of credit support LNL’s reinsurance needs and
specific treaties associated with LNC’s reinsurance
business, which was acquired by Swiss Re on



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 7, 2001 (see Note 11 for
further discussion of this transaction). Letters of credit are
primarily used to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements
of domestic clients of the former Reinsurance segment who have
contracted with the Reinsurance subsidiaries not domiciled in
the United States. The letter of credit allows the cedents to
take credit for reinsured reserves on their statutory balance
sheets. At December 31, 2002, there was a total of
$223.8 million in outstanding bank letters of credit
supporting six separate reinsurance treaties. In exchange for
the letters of credit, LNC paid the banks approximately
$3.8 million in fees in 2002.

Vulnerability from
    Concentrations

At December 31, 2002, LNC did not have a
material concentration of financial instruments in a single
investee or industry. LNC’s investments in mortgage loans
principally involve commercial real estate. At December 31,
2002, 28% of such mortgages, or $1.2 billion, involved
properties located in California and Texas. Such investments
consist of first mortgage liens on completed income-producing
properties and the mortgage outstanding on any individual
property does not exceed $38.2 million. Also at
December 31, 2002, LNC did not have a concentration of:
1) business transactions with a particular customer or
lender; 2) sources of supply of labor or services used in
the business or; 3) a market or geographic area in which
business is conducted that makes it vulnerable to an event that
is at least reasonably possible to occur in the near term and
which could cause a severe impact to LNC’s financial
position. Although LNC does not have any significant
concentration of customers, LNC’s Retirement segment has a
long-standing distribution relationship with American Funds
Distributors (“AFD”) that is significant to this
segment. In 2002, the American Legacy Variable Annuity product
line sold through AFD accounted for about 15% of LNC’s
total gross annuity deposits. In addition, the American Legacy
Variable Annuity product line represents approximately 31% of
LNC’s total gross annuity account values at
December 31, 2002. Recently, LNC and AFD have agreed to
transition the wholesaling of American Legacy to LFD. Currently,
AFD uses wholesalers who focus on both American Funds mutual
funds as well as the American Legacy Variable Annuity products.
Segment management believes that this change to a dedicated team
focused on key broker/ dealer relationships developed in
conjunction with AFD, should lead to renewed growth in American
Legacy Variable Annuity sales.

Other Contingency Matters

LNC and its subsidiaries are involved in various
pending or threatened legal proceedings, including purported
class actions, arising from the conduct of business. In some
instances, these proceedings include claims for unspecified or
substantial punitive damages and similar types of relief in
addition to amounts for alleged contractual liability or
requests for equitable relief. After consultation with legal
counsel and a review of available facts, it is management’s
opinion that these proceedings ultimately will be resolved
without materially affecting the consolidated financial position
of LNC.

In 2001, LNL concluded the settlement of all
class action lawsuits alleging fraud in the sale of LNL
non-variable universal life and participating whole life
policies issued between January 1, 1981 and
December 31, 1998. Since 2001, LNL has reached settlements
with a substantial number of the owners of policies that opted
out of the class action settlement. LNL continues to defend a
small number of opt out claims and lawsuits. While there is
continuing uncertainty about the ultimate costs of settling the
remaining opt out cases, it is management’s opinion that
established reserves are adequate and future developments will
not materially affect the consolidated financial position of LNC.

LNC and LNL have pursued claims with their
liability insurance carriers for reimbursement of certain costs
incurred in connection with the class action settlement and the
settlement of claims and litigation brought by owners that opted
out of the class action settlement. During the fourth quarter of
2002, LNC and LNL settled their claims against three liability
carriers on a favorable basis. LNC and LNL continue to pursue
similar claims against a fourth liability insurance carrier.



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For discussion of the resolution of legal
proceedings related to LNC’s sale of its former reinsurance
business to Swiss Re, refer to the discussion within
Note 11, “Acquisitions and Divestitures.”

State guaranty funds assess insurance companies
to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated
companies. Mandatory assessments may be partially recovered
through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states. LNC
has accrued for expected assessments net of estimated future
premium tax deductions.

Guarantees

LNC has guarantees with off-balance-sheet risks
whose contractual amounts represent credit exposure. Guarantees
with off-balance sheet risks having contractual values of
$22.4 million and $23.9 million were outstanding at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Certain subsidiaries of LNC have invested in real
estate partnerships that use industrial revenue bonds to finance
their projects. LNC has guaranteed the repayment of principal
and interest on these bonds. Certain subsidiaries of LNC are
also involved in other real estate partnerships that use
conventional mortgage loans. In case of default by the
partnerships, LNC has recourse to the underlying real estate.

In some cases, the terms of these arrangements
involve guarantees by each of the partners to indemnify the
mortgagor in the event a partner is unable to pay its principal
and interest payments. These guarantees expire in 2003 through
2012.

In addition, certain subsidiaries of LNC have
sold commercial mortgage loans through grantor trusts, which
issued pass-through certificates. These subsidiaries have agreed
to repurchase any mortgage loans which remain delinquent for
90 days at a repurchase price substantially equal to the
outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest thereon to
the date of repurchase. In case of default by the partnerships,
LNC has recourse to the underlying real estate. It is
management’s opinion that the value of the properties
underlying these commitments is sufficient that in the event of
default, the impact would not be material to LNC. These
guarantees expire in 2004 through 2009.

Derivative Instruments

LNC maintains an overall risk management strategy
that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize
significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused
by interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, equity risk, and
credit risk. LNC assesses these risks by continually identifying
and monitoring changes in interest rate exposure, foreign
currency exposure, equity market exposure, and credit exposure
that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by
evaluating hedging opportunities. Derivative instruments that
are currently used as part of LNC’s interest rate risk
management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate
caps and swaptions. Derivative instruments that are used as part
of LNC’s foreign currency risk management strategy include
foreign currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards. Call
options on LNC stock are used as part of LNC’s equity
market risk management strategy. Call options on the S&P 500
index were used for reinsurance programs and as a result of the
acquisition by Swiss Re of LNC’s reinsurance operations in
December 2001, this equity market risk management strategy was
terminated. LNC also uses credit default swaps as part of its
credit risk management strategy.

By using derivative instruments, LNC is exposed
to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform,
credit risk is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the
derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is
positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes
LNC and, therefore, creates a payment risk for LNC. When the
fair value of a derivative contract is negative, LNC owes the
counterparty and therefore LNC has no payment risk. LNC
minimizes the credit (or payment) risk in derivative instruments
by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties
that are reviewed periodically by



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

LNC. LNC also maintains a policy of requiring
that all derivative contracts be governed by an International
Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master
Agreement.

LNC and LNL are required to maintain minimum
ratings as a matter of routine practice in negotiating ISDA
agreements. Under the majority of ISDA agreements and as a
matter of policy, LNL has agreed to maintain financial strength
or claims-paying ratings above S&P BBB and Moody’s
Baa2. A downgrade below these levels would result in termination
of the derivatives contract at which time any amounts payable by
LNC would be dependent on the market value of the underlying
derivative contract. In certain transactions, LNC and the
counterparty have entered into a collateral support agreement
requiring LNC to post collateral upon significant downgrade. LNC
is required to maintain long-term senior debt ratings above
S&P BBB and Moody’s Baa2. LNC also requires for its own
protection minimum rating standards for counterparty credit
protection. LNL is required to maintain financial strength or
claims-paying ratings above S&P A- and Moody’s A3
under certain ISDA agreements, which collectively do not
represent material notional exposure. LNC does not believe the
inclusion of termination or collateralization events pose any
material threat to its liquidity position.

Market risk is the adverse effect that a change
in interest rates, currency rates, implied volatility rates, or
a change in certain equity indexes or instruments has on the
value of a financial instrument. LNC manages the market risk by
establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of
risk that may be undertaken.

LNC’s derivative instruments are monitored
by its risk management committee as part of that
committee’s oversight of LNC’s derivative activities.
LNC’s derivative instruments committee is responsible for
implementing various hedging strategies that are developed
through its analysis of financial simulation models and other
internal and industry sources. The resulting hedging strategies
are then incorporated into LNC’s overall risk management
strategies.

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, LNC had
derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as
cash flow hedges and fair value hedges and derivative
instruments that were not designated as hedging instruments. LNC
also had derivative instruments that were designated as hedges
of a portion of its net investment in a foreign operation at
December 31, 2002. See Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements for detailed discussion of the accounting
treatment for derivative instruments. For the year ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, LNC recognized a net gain of
$2.5 million after-tax and a net loss of $6.0 million
after-tax, respectively, in net income as a component of
realized gains and losses on investments and derivative
instruments. These gains (losses) relate to the ineffective
portion of cash flow hedges, the change in market value for
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments,
and the gain (loss) on swap terminations. For the year ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, LNC recognized a gain of
$6.8 million after-tax and $3.5 million after-tax,
respectively, in OCI related to the change in market value on
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash
flow hedges. In addition, for the year ended December 31,
2001, $3.5 million after-tax was reclassified from
unrealized gain (loss) on securities available-for-sale to
unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, both in OCI.
This reclassification relates to derivative instruments that
were marked to market through unrealized gain (loss) on
securities available-for-sale prior to the adoption of
FAS 133.



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Derivative
Instruments Designated in Cash Flow Hedges

Interest Rate Swap Agreements.

LNC uses interest rate swap agreements
to hedge its exposure to floating rate bond coupon payments,
replicating a fixed rate bond. An interest rate swap is a
contractual agreement to exchange payments at one or more times
based on the actual or expected price level, performance or
value of one or more underlying interest rates. LNC is required
to pay the counterparty the stream of variable interest payments
based on the coupon payments from the hedged bonds, and in turn,
receives a fixed payment from the counterparty, at a
predetermined interest rate. The net receipts/payments from
these interest rate swaps are recorded in net investment income.
Gains (losses) on interest rate swaps hedging interest rate
exposure on floating rate bond coupon payments are reclassified
from accumulated OCI to net income as bond interest is accrued.

LNC also uses interest rate swap agreements to
hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to the
forecasted purchase of assets for certain investment portfolios.
The gains (losses) resulting from the swap agreements are
recorded in OCI. The gains (losses) are reclassified from
accumulated OCI to earnings over the life of the assets once the
assets are purchased. As of December 31, 2002, there were
no interest rate swaps hedging forecasted asset purchases.

Foreign Currency Swaps.

LNC uses foreign currency swaps, which
are traded over-the-counter, to hedge some of the foreign
exchange risk of investments in fixed maturity securities
denominated in foreign currencies. A foreign currency swap is a
contractual agreement to exchange the currencies of two
different countries at a specified rate of exchange in the
future. Gains (losses) on foreign currency swaps hedging
foreign exchange risk exposure on foreign currency bond coupon
payments are reclassified from accumulated OCI to net income as
bond interest is accrued. The foreign currency swaps expire in
2003 through 2006.

Call Options on LNC Stock.

LNC uses call options on LNC stock to
hedge the expected increase in liabilities arising from stock
appreciation rights (“SARs”) granted on LNC stock.
Upon option expiration, the payment, if any, is the increase in
LNC’s stock price over the strike price of the option
applied to the number of contracts. Call options hedging vested
SARs are not eligible for hedge accounting and both are marked
to market through net income. Call options hedging nonvested
SARs are eligible for hedge accounting and are accounted for as
cash flow hedges of the forecasted vesting of SAR liabilities.
To the extent that the cash flow hedges are effective, changes
in the fair value of the call options are recorded in
accumulated OCI. Amounts recorded in OCI are reclassified to net
income upon vesting of SARs. LNC’s call option positions
will be maintained until such time the SARs are either exercised
or expire and LNC’s SAR liabilities are extinguished. The
SARs expire five years from the date of grant.

Treasury Lock.

LNC
used treasury lock agreements to hedge its exposure to
variability in future semi-annual interest payments,
attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, related
to the issuance of its 10-year $250 million senior debt in
2001 and its 5-year $250 million senior debt in 2002. A
treasury lock is an agreement that allows the holder to lock in
a benchmark interest rate, so that if the benchmark interest
rate increases, the holder is entitled to receive a payment from
the counterparty to the agreement equal to the present value of
the difference in the benchmark interest rate at the
determination date and the locked-in benchmark interest rate. If
the benchmark interest rate decreases, the holder must pay the
counterparty to the agreement an amount equal to the present
value of the difference in the benchmark interest rate at the
determination date and the locked-in benchmark interest rate.
The receipt (payment) from the termination of a treasury
lock is recorded in OCI and is reclassified from accumulated OCI
to interest expense over the coupon-paying period of the related
senior debt.

Total Return Swaps.

LNC used total return swaps to hedge
its exposure to interest rate and spread risk resulting from the
forecasted sale of assets in a securitization of certain LNC
mortgage loans in 2001. A total return swap is an agreement that
allows the holder to protect itself against loss of value by
effectively transferring the economic risk of asset ownership to
the counterparty. The holder pays (receives) the total



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

return equal to interest plus capital gains or
losses on a referenced asset and receives a floating rate of
interest. As of December 31, 2002, LNC did not have any
open total return swaps.

Gains and losses on derivative contracts are
reclassified from accumulated OCI to current period earnings. As
of December 31, 2002, $13.6 million of the deferred
net gains on derivative instruments accumulated in OCI are
expected to be reclassified as earnings during the next twelve
months. The amount reclassed from OCI to earnings for derivative
instruments was $15.9 million and $9.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This
reclassification is primarily due to the receipt of interest
payments associated with variable rate securities and forecasted
purchases, payment of interest on LNC’s senior debt, the
receipt of interest payments associated with foreign currency
securities, and the periodic vesting of SARs.

Derivative Instruments Designated in Fair
    Value Hedges

Interest Rate Swap Agreements.

LNC uses interest rate swap agreements
to hedge the risk of paying a higher fixed rate interest on
company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts holding solely junior subordinated debentures
and on senior debt than would be paid on long-term debt based on
current interest rates in the marketplace. LNC is required to
pay the counterparty a stream of variable interest payments
based on the referenced index, and in turn, receives a fixed
payment from the counterparty, at a predetermined interest rate.
The net receipts/payments from these interest rate swaps are
recorded as an adjustment to the interest expense related to the
debt being hedged. The changes in fair value of the interest
rate swap are reported in the consolidated statement of income
in the period of change along with the offsetting changes in
fair value of the debt being hedged.

Derivative Instruments Designated in Net
    Investment in a Foreign Operation

Foreign Currency Forward Contract.

LNC uses foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in its
foreign subsidiary, Lincoln National (UK) PLC. The foreign
currency forward contracts obligate LNC to deliver a specified
amount of currency at a future date at a specified exchange
rate. All gains or losses on the foreign currency forward
contracts are recorded in OCI and remain in accumulated OCI
until such time that Lincoln National (UK) PLC is sold or
liquidated. The foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
at December 31, 2002 terminate in 2003.

All Other Derivative
    Instruments

LNC uses various other derivative instruments for
risk management purposes that either do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment or have not currently been qualified by LNC
for hedge accounting treatment. The gain or loss related to the
change in market value for these derivative instruments is
recognized in current income during the period of change
(reported as realized gain (loss) on investments in the
consolidated statements of income except where otherwise noted
below).

Interest Rate Cap
Agreements.

The interest rate cap
agreements, which expire in 2003 through 2007, entitle LNC to
receive quarterly payments from the counterparties on specified
future reset dates, contingent on future interest rates. For
each cap, the amount of such quarterly payments, if any, is
determined by the excess of a market interest rate over a
specified cap rate multiplied by the notional amount divided by
four. The purpose of LNC’s interest rate cap agreement
program is to provide a level of protection for its annuity line
of business from the effect of rising interest rates. The
interest rate cap agreements provide an economic hedge of the
annuity line of business. However, the interest rate cap
agreements are not linked to assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet that meet the significantly increased level of
specificity required under FAS 133. Therefore, the interest
rate cap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under
FAS 133.



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Swaptions.

Swaptions, which expire in 2003,
entitle LNC to receive settlement payments from the
counterparties on specified expiration dates, contingent on
future interest rates. For each swaption, the amount of such
settlement payments, if any, is determined by the present value
of the difference between the fixed rate on a market rate swap
and the strike rate multiplied by the notional amount. The
purpose of LNC’s swaption program is to provide a level of
protection for its annuity line of business from the effect of
rising interest rates. The swaptions provide an economic hedge
of the annuity line of business. However, the swaptions are not
linked to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
that meet the significantly increased level of specificity
required under FAS 133. Therefore, the swaptions do not
qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133.

Foreign Exchange Forwards.

LNC’s foreign affiliate, Lincoln
UK, used foreign exchange forward contracts, which are traded
over-the-counter, to hedge short-term debt issuance in
currencies other than the British Pound until Lincoln UK
terminated their commercial paper program in the second quarter
of 2002. The foreign currency forward contracts obligate LNC to
deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date at a
specified exchange rate. The foreign exchange forward contracts
were marked to market through interest and debt expense within
the income statement.

Credit Default Swaps.

LNC uses credit default swaps which
expire in 2003 through 2006 to hedge against a drop in bond
prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit
swap allows LNC to put the bond back to the counterparty at par
upon a credit event by the bond issuer. A credit event is
defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or obligation
acceleration. LNC has not currently qualified credit default
swaps for hedge accounting under FAS 133 as amounts are
insignificant.

Call Options on S&P 500 Index.

Prior to Swiss Re’s acquisition
of LNC’s reinsurance operation in December 2001, LNC used
S&P 500 index call options to offset the increase in its
liabilities resulting from certain reinsurance agreements which
guaranteed payment of the appreciation of the S&P 500 index
on certain underlying annuity products. The call options
provided LNC with settlement payments from the counterparties on
specified expiration dates. The payment, if any, was the
percentage increase in the index, over the strike price defined
in the contract, applied to the notional amount. The S&P 500
call options provided an economic hedge of the reinsurance
liabilities, but the hedging relationship was not eligible for
hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133.

Call Options on LNC Stock.

As discussed previously in the Cash
Flow Hedges section, LNC uses call options on LNC stock to hedge
the expected increase in liabilities arising from SARs granted
on LNC stock. Call options hedging vested SARs are not eligible
for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133.

Derivative Instrument Embedded in Deferred
Compensation Plan.

LNC has certain
deferred compensation plans that have embedded derivative
instruments. The liability related to these plans varies based
on the investment options selected by the participants. The
liability related to certain investment options selected by the
participants is marked to market through net income. This
derivative instrument is not eligible for hedge accounting
treatment under FAS 133.

Call Options on Bifurcated Remarketable Put
Bonds.

LNC owns various debt
securities that contain call options attached by an investment
banker before the sale to the investor. These freestanding call
options are exercisable by a party other than the issuer of the
debt security to which they are attached and are accounted for
separately from the debt security. LNC has not currently
qualified call options bifurcated from remarketable put bonds
for hedge accounting treatment as amounts are insignificant.

LNC has used certain other derivative instruments
in the past for hedging purposes. Although other derivative
instruments may have been used in the past, any derivative type
that was not outstanding from January 1, 2001 through
December 31, 2002 is not discussed in this disclosure.
Other derivative instruments LNC has used include spread-lock
agreements, financial futures and put options. At
December 31, 2002, there are no outstanding positions in
these derivative instruments.

Additional Derivative Information.

Income and (expenses) for the
agreements and contracts described above amounted to
$23.0 million, $3.5 million and $(7.3) million in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in income for
2002 was primarily because of payments received on interest rate
swaps. The increase in 2001 was primarily because under
FAS 133 premiums for caps and swaptions are no longer
amortized.

LNC is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties on various derivative
contracts. However, LNC does not anticipate nonperformance by
any of the counterparties. The credit risk associated with such
agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from
financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance
records. The amount of such exposure is essentially the net
replacement cost or market value less collateral held for such
agreements with each counterparty if the net market value is in
LNC’s favor. At December 31, 2002, the exposure was
$85.8 million.

8.     Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The following discussion outlines the
methodologies and assumptions used to determine the estimated
fair value of LNC’s financial instruments. Considerable
judgment is required to develop these fair values. Accordingly,
the estimates shown are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts that would be realized in a one-time, current market
exchange of all of LNC’s financial instruments.

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities.

Fair values for fixed maturity
securities are based on quoted market prices, where available.
For fixed maturity securities not actively traded, fair values
are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing
services. In the case of private placements, fair values are
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a
current market rate applicable to the coupon rate, credit
quality and maturity of the investments. The fair values for
equity securities are based on quoted market prices.

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate.

The estimated fair value of mortgage
loans on real estate was established using a discounted cash
flow method based on credit rating, maturity and future income.
The ratings for mortgages in good standing are based on property
type, location, market conditions, occupancy, debt service
coverage, loan to value, caliber of tenancy, borrower and
payment record. Fair values for impaired mortgage loans are
based on: 1) the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate;
2) the loan’s market price or; 3) the fair value
of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

Policy Loans.

The
estimated fair value of investments in policy loans was
calculated on a composite discounted cash flow basis using
Treasury interest rates consistent with the maturity durations
assumed. These durations were based on historical experience.

Derivative
Instruments.

LNC employs several
different methods for determining the fair value of its
derivative instruments. Fair values for these contracts are
based on current settlement values. These values are based on:
1) quoted market prices for foreign currency exchange
contracts and financial futures contracts; 2) industry
standard models that are commercially available for interest
rate cap agreements, swaptions, spread-lock agreements, interest
rate swaps, commodity swaps, credit default swaps, total return
swaps and put options; 3) Monte Carlo techniques for the
equity call options on LNC stock. These techniques project cash
flows of the derivatives using current and implied future market
conditions. The cash flows are then present valued to arrive at
the derivatives’ current fair market values; and
4) Black-Scholes pricing methodology for standard European
equity call options.

Other Investments, and Cash and Invested Cash.

The carrying value for assets
classified as other investments, and cash and invested cash in
the accompanying balance sheets approximates their fair value.
Other investments include limited partnership investments which
are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Investment Type Insurance
Contracts.

The balance sheet captions,
“Insurance Policy and Claims Reserves” and
“Contractholder Funds,” include investment type
insurance contracts (i.e. deposit contracts and certain
guaranteed interest contracts). The fair values for the deposit
contracts and certain guaranteed interest contracts are based on
their approximate surrender values. The fair values for the
remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts are
estimated using discounted cash flow calculations. These
calculations are based on interest rates currently offered on
similar contracts with maturities that are consistent with those
remaining for the contracts being valued.

The remainder of the balance sheet captions,
“Insurance Policy and Claims Reserves” and
“Contractholder Funds” that do not fit the definition
of “investment type insurance contracts” are
considered insurance contracts. Fair value disclosures are not
required for these insurance contracts and have not been
determined by LNC. It is LNC’s position that the disclosure
of the fair value of these insurance contracts is important
because readers of these financial statements could draw
inappropriate conclusions about LNC’s shareholders’
equity determined on a fair value basis. It could be misleading
if only the fair value of assets and liabilities defined as
financial instruments are disclosed. LNC and other companies in
the insurance industry are monitoring the related actions of the
various rule-making bodies and attempting to determine an
appropriate methodology for estimating and disclosing the
“fair value” of their insurance contract liabilities.

Short-term and Long-term Debt.

Fair values for long-term debt issues
are based on quoted market prices or estimated using discounted
cash flow analysis based on LNC’s current incremental
borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements where
quoted prices are not available. For short-term debt, the
carrying value approximates fair value.

Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable
Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts Holding Solely Junior
Subordinated Debentures.

Fair values
for company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely junior
subordinated debentures are based on quoted market prices.

Guarantees.

LNC’s guarantees include guarantees related to industrial
revenue bonds, real estate partnerships and mortgage loan
pass-through certificates. Based on historical performance where
repurchases have been negligible and the current status of the
debt, none of the loans are delinquent and the fair value
liability for the guarantees related to the industrial revenue
bonds, real estate partnerships and mortgage loan pass-through
certificates is insignificant.

Investment Commitments.

Fair values for commitments to make
investments in fixed maturity securities (primarily private
placements), mortgage loans on real estate and real estate are
based on the difference between the value of the committed
investments as of the date of the accompanying balance sheets
and the commitment date. These estimates take into account
changes in interest rates, the counterparties’ credit
standing and the remaining terms of the commitments.

Separate Accounts.

Assets held in separate accounts are
reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair
value. The related liabilities are also reported at fair value
in amounts equal to the separate account assets.



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The carrying values and estimated fair values of
LNC’s financial instruments are as follows:

*

Total derivative instruments for 2001 are
    composed of $46.4 million and $(0.3) million on the
    consolidated balance sheet in Derivative Instruments and Other
    Liabilities, respectively.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
carrying value of the deposit contracts and certain guaranteed
contracts is net of deferred acquisition costs of
$486.0 million and $338.9 million, respectively,
excluding adjustments for deferred acquisition costs applicable
to changes in fair value of securities. The carrying values of
these contracts are stated net of deferred acquisition costs so
that they are comparable with the fair value basis.

9.     Segment
Information

LNC has four business segments: Lincoln
Retirement (formerly known as the Annuities segment), Life
Insurance, Investment Management and Lincoln UK. Prior to the
fourth quarter of 2001, LNC had a Reinsurance segment.
LNC’s reinsurance business was acquired by Swiss Re in
December 2001. As the majority of the business acquired by Swiss
Re was via indemnity reinsurance agreements, LNC is not relieved
of its legal liability to the ceding companies for this
business. This means that the liabilities and obligations
associated with the reinsured contracts remain on the balance
sheets of LNC with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from
Swiss Re. In addition, the gain resulting from the indemnity
reinsurance portion of the transaction was deferred and is being
amortized into earnings at the rate that earnings on the
reinsured business are expected to emerge over a period of
15 years. The ongoing management of the indemnity
reinsurance contracts and the reporting of the deferred gain is
within LNC’s Other Operations. Given the lengthy period of
time over which LNC will continue to amortize the deferred gain,
and the fact that related assets and liabilities will continue
to be reported on LNC’s financial statements, the
historical results for the



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reinsurance segment prior to the close of the
transaction with Swiss Re are not reflected in discontinued
operations, but as a separate line in Other Operations. The
results for 2001 related to the former Reinsurance segment are
for the eleven months ended November 30, 2001.

The Lincoln Retirement segment, headquartered in
Fort Wayne, Indiana, provides tax-deferred investment
growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients through
the manufacture and sale of fixed and variable annuities.
Through a broad-based distribution network, Lincoln Retirement
provides an array of annuity products to individuals and
employer-sponsored groups in all 50 states of the United
States. Lincoln Retirement distributes some of its products
through LNC’s wholesaling unit, Lincoln Financial
Distributors (“LFD”), as well as LNC’s retail
unit, Lincoln Financial Advisors (“LFA”). In addition,
group fixed and variable annuity products and the Alliance
program are distributed to the employer-sponsored retirement
market through Lincoln Retirement’s Fringe Benefit Division
dedicated sales force.

The Life Insurance segment, headquartered in
Hartford, Connecticut, focuses on the creation and protection of
wealth for its clients through the manufacture and sale of life
insurance products throughout the United States. The Life
Insurance segment offers universal life, variable universal
life, interest-sensitive whole life, term life and corporate
owned life insurance. The segment also offers linked-benefit
life insurance (a universal life product with a long-term care
benefit). A majority of the Life Insurance segment’s
products are currently distributed through LFD and LFA. In the
third quarter 2002, the Life Insurance segment entered into a
marketing agreement to distribute life insurance products
through the M Financial Group, a well-respected and successful
nationwide organization of independent firms serving the needs
of affluent individuals and corporations.

The Investment Management segment, headquartered
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, offers a variety of asset
management services to retail and institutional clients
throughout the United States and certain foreign countries. Its
product offerings include mutual funds and managed accounts. It
also provides investment management and account administration
services for variable annuity products, and 401(k) plans,
“529” college savings plans, pension, endowment,
trust, and other institutional accounts. Retail products are
primarily marketed by LFD through financial intermediaries
including LFA. Institutional products, including large case
401(k) plans, are marketed by a separate sales force within
Delaware working closely with manager selection consultants.

Lincoln UK is headquartered in Barnwood,
Gloucester, England, and is licensed to do business throughout
the United Kingdom (“UK”). Although Lincoln UK
transferred its sales force to Inter-Alliance Group PLC in the
third quarter of 2000, it continues to manage, administer and
accept new deposits on its current block of business and, as
required by UK regulation, accept new business for certain
products. Lincoln UK’s product portfolio principally
consists of unit-linked life and pension products, which are
similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products.

LNC reports operations not directly related to
the business segments and unallocated corporate items (i.e.,
corporate investment income, interest expense on corporate debt,
unallocated overhead expenses, and the operations of LFA and
LFD) in “Other Operations”. As noted above, the
financial results of the former Reinsurance segment were moved
to Other Operations upon the close of the transaction with Swiss
Re in December 2001.

Revenues for the Investment Management segment
    include inter-segment revenues for asset management services
    provided to the other segments of LNC. These inter-segment
    revenues totaled $83.8 million, $87.5 million and
    $88.9 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

During 2000, management initiated a plan to
change the operational and management reporting structure of
LNC’s wholesale distribution organization. Beginning with
the quarter ended March 31, 2001, LFD, the wholesaling arm
of LNC’s distribution network, was reported within Other
Operations. Previously, LNC’s wholesaling efforts were
conducted separately within the Lincoln Retirement, Life
Insurance and Investment



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

Management segments. Earlier periods were
restated to aid comparability of segment reporting between
periods.

Also, in the fourth quarter of 2000, a decision
was made to change the management reporting and operational
responsibilities for First Penn-Pacific’s Schaumburg,
Illinois annuities business. Beginning with the quarter ended
March 31, 2001, the financial reporting for First
Penn-Pacific’s annuities business was included in the
Lincoln Retirement segment. This business was previously managed
and reported in the Life Insurance segment. Earlier periods were
restated to aid the comparability of segment reporting between
periods.

Prior to 2001, the management of general account
investments performed by the Investment Management segment for
LNC’s U.S. based insurance operations was generally
priced on an “at cost” basis. Effective
January 1, 2001, substantially all of these internal
investment management services were priced on an arms-length
“profit” basis. Under this new internal pricing
standard, the Investment Management segment receives
approximately 18.5 basis points on certain assets under
management. The change in pricing of internal investment
management services impacted segment reporting results for the
Lincoln Retirement, Life Insurance, Reinsurance and Investment
Management segments, along with Other Operations. Earlier
periods were restated to aid the comparability of segment
reporting between periods.

Most of LNC’s foreign operations are
conducted by Lincoln UK, a UK company. The data for this company
is shown above under the Lincoln UK segment heading. In
addition, the Investment Management segment has non-U.S.
operations. Foreign intracompany revenues are not significant.
Financial data for Lincoln UK and the other non-U.S. units*
is as follows:

*

The financial data for other non-U.S. units
    includes the activity of several former reinsurance subsidiaries
    for the year ended December 31, 2000 and for the eleven
    months ended November 30, 2001. These entities were sold to
    Swiss Re in December 2001.

10.

Shareholders’ Equity

LNC’s common and series A preferred stock is
without par value.

All of the issued and outstanding series A
preferred stock is $3 cumulative convertible and is
convertible at any time into shares of common stock. The
conversion rate is sixteen shares of common stock for each share
of series A preferred stock, subject to adjustment for certain
events. The series A preferred stock is redeemable at the option
of LNC at $80 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
Outstanding series A preferred stock has full voting rights,
subject to adjustment if LNC is in default as to the payment of
dividends. If LNC is liquidated or dissolved, holders of series
A preferred stock will be entitled to payments of $80 per
share. The difference between the aggregate preference on
liquidation value and the financial statement balance for the
series A preferred stock was $0.9 million at
December 31, 2002.

LNC has outstanding one common share purchase
(“Right”) on each outstanding share of LNC’s
common stock. A Right will also be issued with each share of
LNC’s common stock that is issued before the



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Rights become exercisable or expire. If a person
or group announces an offer that would result in beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of LNC’s common stock, the Rights
will become exercisable and each Right will entitle its holder
to purchase one share of LNC’s common stock for $100. Upon
the acquisition of 15% or more of LNC’s common stock, each
holder of a Right (other than the person acquiring the 15% or
more) will have the right to acquire the number of shares of LNC
common stock that have a market value of two times the exercise
price of the Right. If LNC is acquired in a business combination
transaction in which LNC does not survive, each holder of a
Right (other than the acquiring person) will have the right to
acquire common stock of the acquiring person having a market
value of two times the exercise price of the Right. LNC can
redeem each Right for one cent at any time prior to the tenth
day after a person or group has acquired 15% or more of
LNC’s common stock. The Rights expire on November 14,
2006. As of December 31, 2002, there were
177,307,999 Rights outstanding.

During 2002, 2001 and 2000, LNC purchased and
retired 12,088,100; 11,278,022 and 6,222,581 shares,
respectively, of its common stock at a total cost of
$474.5 million, $503.7 million and
$210.0 million, respectively. The common stock account was
reduced for these purchases in proportion to the percentage of
shares acquired. The remainder of the purchase price was charged
to retained earnings.

Per share amounts for net income are shown on the
income statement using 1) an earnings per common share
basic calculation and 2) an earnings per common
share-assuming dilution calculation. A reconciliation of the
factors used in the two calculations are as follows:

LNC has stock options outstanding which were
issued at prices that are above the current average market price
of LNC common stock. In the event the average market price of
LNC’s common stock exceeds the issue price of stock
options, such options would be dilutive to LNC’s earnings
per share and will be shown in the table above. During 1999, LNC
changed its deferred compensation plans so that participants

Available-for-sale,” are as follows:

Adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and
amounts required to satisfy policyholder commitments are netted
against the Deferred Acquisition Costs asset line and included

The “Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) on
Derivative Instruments” component of other comprehensive
income shown on the Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders’ Equity is net of Federal income tax expense
of $1.2 million and $12.6 million ($9.5 million
of the tax expense relates to the transition adjustment recorded
in the first quarter of 2001 for the adoption of FAS 133)
for 2002 and 2001, respectively, and net of adjustments to
deferred amortization costs of $1.6 million and
$23.8 million ($18.3 million relates to the transition
adjustment recorded for the adoption of FAS 133) for 2002
and 2001, respectively.

The “Foreign Currency Translation”

Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity is net of
Federal income tax expense (benefit) of $31.7 million,
$(16.1) million and $(4.4) million for 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

11.     Acquisitions
and Divestitures

On August 30, 2002, LNC acquired The
Administrative Management Group, Inc. (“AMG”), an
employee benefits record keeping firm for $21.6 million in
cash. Contingent payments up to an additional



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$14 million will be paid over a period of
4 years (2003-2006) if certain criteria are met. Any such
contingent payments will be expensed as incurred. AMG, a
strategic partner of LNC’s Retirement segment for several
years, provides record keeping services for the Lincoln Alliance
Program along with approximately 400 other clients nationwide.
As of December 31, 2002, the application of purchase
accounting to this acquisition resulted in goodwill of
$20.2 million.

On December 7, 2001, Swiss Re acquired
LNC’s reinsurance operation for $2.0 billion. In
addition, LNC retained the capital supporting the reinsurance
operation. After giving effect to the increased levels of
capital needed within the Life Insurance and Lincoln Retirement
segments that result from the change in the ongoing mix of
business under LNC’s internal capital allocation models,
the disposition of LNC’s reinsurance operation freed-up
approximately $100 million of retained capital.

The transaction structure involved a series of
indemnity reinsurance transactions combined with the sale of
certain stock companies that comprised LNC’s reinsurance
operation. At the time of closing, an immediate gain of
$15.0 million after-tax was recognized on the sale of the
stock companies. A gain of $723.1 million after-tax
($1.1 billion pre-tax) relating to the indemnity
reinsurance agreements was reported at the time of closing. This
gain was recorded as a deferred gain on LNC’s consolidated
balance sheet, in accordance with the requirements of
FAS 113, and is being amortized into earnings at the rate
that earnings on the reinsured business are expected to emerge,
over a period of 15 years.

Effective with the closing of the transaction,
the former Reinsurance segment’s historical results were
moved into “Other Operations.” During December 2001
LNC recognized in Other Operations $5.0 million
($7.9 million pre-tax) of deferred gain amortization. In
addition, in December 2001, LNC recognized $7.9 million
($12.5 million pre-tax) of accelerated deferred gain
amortization relating to the fact that certain Canadian
indemnity reinsurance contracts were novated after the sale, but
prior to December 31, 2001.

On October 29, 2002 LNC and Swiss Re settled
disputed matters totaling about $770 million that had
arisen in connection with the final closing balance sheets
associated with Swiss Re’s acquisition of LNC’s
reinsurance operations. The settlement provided for a payment by
LNC of $195 million to Swiss Re, which was recorded by LNC
as a reduction in deferred gain. As a result of additional
information made available to LNC following the settlement with
Swiss Re in the fourth quarter of 2002, LNC recorded a further
reduction in the deferred gain of $51.6 million after-tax
($79.4 million pre-tax), as well as a $9.4 million
after-tax ($8.3 million pre-tax) reduction in the gain on
the sale of subsidiaries.

As part of the dispute settlement, LNC also paid
$100 million to Swiss Re in satisfaction of LNC’s
$100 million indemnification obligation with respect to
personal accident business. As a result of this payment, LNC has
no further underwriting risk with respect to the reinsurance
business sold. However, because LNC has not been relieved of its
legal liabilities to the underlying ceding companies with
respect to the portion of the business reinsured by Swiss Re,
under FAS 113 the reserves for the underlying reinsurance
contracts as well as a corresponding reinsurance recoverable
from Swiss Re will continue to be carried on LNC’s balance
sheet during the run-off period of the underlying reinsurance
business. This is particularly relevant in the case of the
exited personal accident and disability income reinsurance lines
of business where the underlying reserves are based upon various
estimates that are subject to considerable uncertainty.

As a result of developments and information
obtained during 2002 relating to personal accident and
disability income matters, LNC increased these exited business
reserves by $198.5 million after-tax ($305.4 million
pre-tax). After giving effect to LNC’s $100 million
indemnification obligation, LNC recorded a $133.5 after-tax
($205.4 million pre-tax) increase in reinsurance
recoverable from Swiss Re with a corresponding increase in the
deferred gain.

The combined effects of the 2002 settlement of
disputed matters and exited business reserve increases reduced
the $723.1 million after-tax ($1.1 billion pre-tax)
deferred gain reported at closing by $44.9 million
after-tax ($69 million pre-tax). During 2002, LNC amortized
$47 million after-tax ($72.4 million pre-tax) of



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the deferred gain. An additional
$1.3 million after-tax ($2 million pre-tax) of
deferred gain was recognized, due to a novation of certain
Canadian business during 2002.

Also during 2002, LNC exercised a contractual
right to “put” its interest in a subsidiary company
containing LNC’s disability income reinsurance business to
Swiss Re for $10 million. The $10 million sale price
was approximately equal to LNC’s book basis in the
subsidiary.

Through December 31, 2002, of the original
$2 billion in proceeds received by LNC, approximately
$0.56 billion was paid for taxes and deal expenses and
approximately $1.0 billion was used to repurchase stock,
reduce debt, and support holding company cash flow needs. LNC
also paid $195 million to Swiss Re to settle the closing
balance sheet disputed matters and $100 million to satisfy
LNC’s personal accident business indemnification
obligations. The remaining proceeds have been dedicated to the
ongoing capital needs of The Lincoln National Life Insurance
Company.

Because of ongoing uncertainty related to
personal accident and disability income businesses, the reserves
related to these exited business lines carried on LNC’s
balance sheet at December 31, 2002 may ultimately prove to
be either excessive or deficient. For instance, in the event
that future developments indicate that these reserves should be
increased, under FAS 113 LNC would record a current period
non-cash charge to record the increase in reserves. Because
Swiss Re is responsible for paying the underlying claims to the
ceding companies, LNC would record a corresponding increase in
reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re. However, FAS 113
does not permit LNC to take the full benefit in earnings for the
recording of the increase in the reinsurance recoverable in the
period of the change. Rather, LNC would increase the deferred
gain recognized upon the closing of the indemnity reinsurance
transaction with Swiss Re and would report a cumulative
amortization “catch-up” adjustment to the deferred
gain balance as increased earnings recognized in the period of
change. Any amount of additional increase to the deferred gain
above the cumulative amortization “catch-up”
adjustment must continue to be deferred and will be amortized
into income in future periods over the remaining period of
expected run-off of the underlying business. No cash would be
transferred between LNC and Swiss Re as a result of these
developments.

Accordingly, even though LNC has no continuing
underwriting risk, and no cash would be transferred between LNC
and Swiss Re, in the event that future developments indicate
LNC’s December 31, 2002 personal accident or
disability income reserves are deficient or redundant,
FAS 113 requires LNC to adjust earnings in the period of
change, with only a partial offset to earnings for the
cumulative deferred gain amortization adjustment in the period
of change. The remaining amount of increased gain would be
amortized into earnings over the remaining run-off period of the
underlying business.

As noted above, effective with the closing of the
transaction, the Reinsurance segment’s results for the
eleven months ended November 30, 2001 and the year ended
December 31, 2000 were moved into “Other
Operations.”

12.     Restructuring
Charges

During 1998, LNC implemented a restructuring plan
relating to the integration of existing life and annuity
operations with the new business operations acquired from CIGNA,
and a second restructuring plan related to downsizing LNC’s
corporate center operations. The aggregate charges associated
with these two unrelated restructuring plans totaled
$34.3 million after-tax ($52.8 million pre-tax) and
were included in Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other
Expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year
ended December 31, 1998. These aggregate pre-tax costs
include $19.6 million for employee severance and
termination benefits, $9.9 million for asset impairments
and $23.3 million for costs relating to exiting business
activities. The CIGNA restructuring plan was completed in the
first quarter of 2000. During the fourth quarter of 2000,
$0.5 million (pre-tax) of the original charge to downsize
LNC’s corporate center operations was reversed. This plan
was completed in the third quarter of 2002 due to the
termination of the lease which resulted from LNC’s purchase
and ultimate sale of the abandoned building. The remaining
$0.2 million related to the terminated lease was reversed
as a reduction in restructuring costs during the third quarter
of 2002. Total pre-tax costs of $56.2 million were expended
or written-off under these restructuring plans.

In 1999, LNC implemented three different
restructuring plans relating to 1) the downsizing and
consolidation of the operations of Lynch & Mayer, Inc.
(“Lynch & Mayer”); 2) the discontinuance
of HMO excess-of-loss reinsurance programs; and 3) the
streamlining of Lincoln UK’s operations. The aggregate
charges associated with these three unrelated restructuring
plans totaled $21.8 million after-tax ($31.8 million
pre-tax) and were included in Underwriting, Acquisition,
Insurance and Other Expenses on the Consolidated Statement of
Income for the year ended December 31, 1999. These
aggregate pre-tax costs include $8.3 million for employee
severance and termination benefits, $9.8 million for asset
impairments and $13.7 million for costs relating to exiting
business activities. Through December 31, 2002, actual
pre-tax costs of $24.8 million have been expended or
written-off under these restructuring plans. During the fourth
quarter of 1999, $3.0 million (pre-tax) of the original
charge recorded for the Lynch & Mayer restructuring
plan was reversed due primarily to a change in estimate for
space cost. This reversal reduced the reported fourth quarter
1999 restructuring charges. In addition, during the fourth
quarter of 1999, $1.5 million (pre-tax) associated with
lease terminations was released into income. During the fourth
quarter of 2000, the Lynch & Mayer restructuring plan
was completed and $0.3 million (pre-tax) of the original
charge for the Lynch & Mayer was reversed. Also, during
the fourth quarter of 2000, $1.0 million (pre-tax) of the
original charge for the discontinuance of HMO excess-of-loss
restructuring plan was reversed. During the fourth quarter of
2001, the remaining restructuring reserve of $0.2 million
relating to the HMO excess-of-loss reinsurance programs was



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

transferred to Swiss Re as part of its
acquisition of LNC’s reinsurance operations. As of
December 31, 2002, a balance of $2.5 million (pre-tax)
remains in the restructuring reserve for the Lincoln UK
restructuring plan and is expected to be utilized in completion
of this plan. Details of the Lincoln UK restructuring plan are
provided below.

During the fourth quarter of 1999, LNC recorded a
restructuring charge in its Lincoln UK segment of
$6.5 million after-tax ($10.0 million pre-tax). The
objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce operating
costs by consolidating and eliminating redundant staff functions
and facilities. The restructuring plan identified the following
activities and associated costs to achieve the objectives of the
restructuring plan: (1) severance and termination benefits
of $3.9 million related to the elimination of 119
positions, and (2) other costs of $6.1 million
primarily related to the remaining lease payments on closed
facilities. Expenditures and write-offs under the restructuring
plan began in the fourth quarter of 1999 and were completed in
the 3rd quarter of 2001 except for lease payments on closed
facilities which will continue until 2016. Through
December 31, 2002, $7.5 million (pre-tax) has been
expended or written-off under this restructuring plan and 112
positions have been eliminated.

During 2000, LNC implemented restructuring plans
relating to 1) the downsizing and consolidation of the
operations of Vantage Global Advisors, Inc.
(“Vantage”); 2) the exit of all direct sales and
sales support operations of Lincoln UK and the consolidation of
its Uxbridge home office with its Barnwood home office; and
3) the downsizing and consolidation of the investment
management operations of Lincoln Investment Management. The
Vantage restructuring charge was recorded in the second quarter,
the Lincoln UK restructuring was recorded in the third and
fourth quarters, and the Lincoln Investment Management
restructuring charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000.
The aggregate charges associated with all of these restructuring
plans entered into during 2000 totaled $81.8 million
after-tax ($107.4 million pre-tax). These charges were
included in Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other
Expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year
ended December 31, 2000. The component elements of these
aggregate pre-tax costs include employee severance and
termination benefits of $33.8 million, write-off of
impaired assets of $40.9 million and other exit costs of
$32.7 million. During the fourth quarter of 2000,
$0.6 million (pre-tax) of the original charge recorded for
the Vantage restructuring plan was reversed as a reduction of
restructuring costs. The Vantage restructuring plan was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2001 and total expenditures
and write-offs under this plan totaled $3.5 million pre-tax
and 13 positions were eliminated under this plan. Expenditures
and write-offs for the Lincoln UK restructuring plan were
completed in the fourth quarter of 2001 except for lease
payments on abandoned office facilities, which will continue
until 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2002, $1.7 million of
the Lincoln UK restructuring reserve was released as a result of
new tenants being contracted for several of the abandoned office
facilities on terms that were better than originally expected.
All expenditures and write-offs for the Lincoln Investment
Management restructuring plan were completed in the third
quarter of 2002 and $0.4 million of the original reserve
was released. The release of the reserve was primarily due to
LNC’s purchase and ultimate sale of the vacant office space
on terms which were favorable to what was included in the
original restructuring plan for rent on this office space.
Actual pre-tax costs totaling $3.5 million were expended or
written-off and 19 positions were eliminated. Details of the
Lincoln UK restructuring plan are provided below.

On September 28, 2000, LNC announced the
transfer of the Lincoln UK sales force to Inter-Alliance and the
decision to cease writing new business in the UK through direct
sales distribution. As a result of these decisions, Lincoln UK
continues to manage, administer and accept new deposits on its
current block of business and will only accept new business for
certain products as required by UK regulations. To implement
these decisions, LNC entered into an exit plan
(“restructuring plan”) in the third quarter of 2000.
The objective of this restructuring plan was to exit all sales
and sales support operations and consolidate the Uxbridge home
office with the Barnwood home office. Where all commitment date
and liability recognition criteria were met in the third quarter
of 2000, charges for this restructuring plan were recorded in
the third quarter of 2000. The charges associated with this
restructuring plan that were recorded in the fourth quarter of



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2000 occurred as final decisions under the
contract with Inter-Alliance related to personnel and facilities
were made, as regulatory requirements related to certain
employee involuntary termination benefits were met, and as the
decision to consolidate the Uxbridge home office with the
Barnwood home office was finalized.

The charges recorded in the third and fourth
quarters of 2000 related to this restructuring plan were
$40.5 million after-tax ($53.5 million pre-tax) and
$36.1 million after-tax ($45.9 million pre-tax),
respectively. The components of the pre-tax costs include
employee severance and termination benefits of
$29.8 million related to the elimination of 671 positions,
write-off of impaired assets of $39.2 million and other
costs to exit of $30.4 million. All expenditures under this
plan except for those related to abandoned office facilities
were completed by the end of 2001. Expenditures for rents on
abandoned office facilities are expected to be complete by 2015.
In the fourth quarter of 2002, $1.7 million of the Lincoln
UK restructuring reserve was released as a result of new tenants
being contracted for several of the abandoned office facilities
on terms that were better than originally expected. Through
December 31, 2002, $88.0 million (pre-tax) has been
expended or written-off under this restructuring plan and
671 positions have been eliminated. As of December 31,
2002, a balance of $9.7 million remains in the
restructuring reserve for this plan.

During 2001, LNC implemented restructuring plans
relating to 1) the consolidation of the Syracuse operations
of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York into the
Lincoln Retirement segment operations in Fort Wayne,
Indiana and Portland, Maine; 2) the elimination of
duplicative functions in the Schaumburg, Illinois operations of
First Penn-Pacific, and the absorption of these functions into
the Lincoln Retirement and Life Insurance segment operations in
Fort Wayne, Indiana and Hartford, Connecticut; 3) the
reorganization of the life wholesaling function within the
independent planner distribution channel, consolidation of
retirement wholesaling territories, and streamlining of the
marketing and communications functions in LFD; 4) the
reorganization and consolidation of the life insurance
operations in Hartford, Connecticut related to the streamlining
of underwriting and new business processes and the completion of
outsourcing of administration of certain closed blocks of
business; 5) the planned consolidation of the Boston,
Massachusetts investment and marketing office with the
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania investment and marketing operations
in order to eliminate redundant facilities and functions within
the Investment Management segment; 6) the combination of
LFD channel oversight, positioning of LFD to take better
advantage of ongoing “marketplace consolidation” and
expansion of the customer base of wholesalers in certain
non-productive territories and 7) the consolidation of
operations and space in LNC’s Fort Wayne, Indiana
operations.

The Syracuse restructuring charge was recorded in
the first quarter of 2001 and was completed in the first quarter
of 2002. The Schaumburg, Illinois restructuring charge was
recorded in the second quarter of 2001, the LFD restructuring
charges were recorded in the second and fourth quarters of 2001,
and the remaining restructuring charges were all recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2001. The LFD restructuring plan that was
initiated in the second quarter of 2001 was completed in the
fourth quarter of 2002. The Life Insurance segment restructuring
plan that was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2001 was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2002.

The aggregate charges associated with all
restructuring plans entered into during 2001 totaled
$24.6 million after-tax ($38.0 million pre-tax) and
were included in Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other
Expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year
ended December 31, 2001. The component elements of these
aggregate pre-tax costs include employee severance and
termination benefits of $12.2 million, write-off of
impaired assets of $3.3 million and other exit costs of
$22.5 million primarily related to the termination of
equipment leases ($1.4 million) and rent on abandoned
office space ($20.0 million). Actual pre-tax costs totaling
$1.3 million were expended or written-off and
30 positions were eliminated under the Syracuse
restructuring plan. The total amount expended for this plan
exceeded the original restructuring reserve by
$0.3 million. Actual pre-tax costs totaling
$1.8 million were expended or written-off and
26 positions were eliminated under the second quarter of
2001 LFD restructuring plan. The amount expended for this
plan was equal to the original reserve. Actual pre-tax costs
totaling $2.3 million were expended or



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

written-off and 36 positions were eliminated
under the fourth quarter of 2001 Life Insurance segment
restructuring plan. The amount expended for this plan was in
excess of the original reserve by less than $0.1 million.
In addition, $0.1 million of excess reserve on the FPP
restructuring plan was released during the second quarter of
2002 and $1.5 million of excess reserve on the
Fort Wayne restructuring plan was released during the third
quarter of 2002. The release of the reserve on the
Fort Wayne restructuring plan was due to LNC’s
purchase and ultimate sale of the vacant building on terms which
were favorable to what was included in the original
restructuring plan for rent on this abandoned office space.
Actual pre-tax costs totaling $34.0 million have been
expended or written-off for the remaining plans through
December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, a balance
of $1.4 million remains in the restructuring reserves for
the remaining plans and is expected to be utilized in the
completion of the plans. Details of each of the remaining
2001 restructuring plans are provided below.

During the second quarter of 2001, LNC recorded
restructuring charges in its Lincoln Retirement and Life
Insurance segments of $0.63 million ($0.97 million
pre-tax) and $2.03 million ($3.12 million pre-tax),
respectively, related to a restructuring plan for the
Schaumburg, Illinois operations of First Penn-Pacific. The
objective of this plan was to eliminate duplicative functions in
Schaumburg, Illinois by transitioning them into the Lincoln
Retirement and Life Insurance segment operations in
Fort Wayne, Indiana and Hartford, Connecticut,
respectively, in order to reduce on-going operating costs. The
restructuring plan identified the following activities and
associated pre-tax costs to achieve the objectives of the plan:
(1) severance and termination benefits of
$3.19 million related to the elimination of 27 positions
and (2) other costs of $0.9 million. In the second
quarter of 2002, $0.1 million of the restructuring reserve
was released. Actual pre-tax costs totaling $3.7 million
have been expended or written-off and 26 positions have
been eliminated under this plan through December 31, 2002.
As of December 31, 2002, a balance of $0.3 million
remains in the restructuring reserve for this plan. Expenditures
under this plan are expected to be completed in the first
quarter of 2004.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, LNC recorded a
restructuring charge in its Investment Management segment of
$0.4 million ($0.6 million pre-tax). The objectives of
this restructuring plan were to consolidate the Boston,
Massachusetts investment and marketing office with the
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania investment and marketing operations
in order to eliminate redundant facilities and functions within
the segment. The restructuring plan identified the following
activities and associated pre-tax costs to achieve the
objectives of the plan: (1) write-off of impaired assets of
$0.1 million and (2) other costs of $0.5 million
primarily related to lease payments on abandoned office space.
Actual pre-tax costs totaling $0.2 million have been
expended or written-off through December 31, 2002. As of
December 31, 2002, a balance of $0.4 million remains
in the restructuring reserve for this plan. Expenditures under
this plan are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of
2005 consistent with the lease term.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, LNC recorded a
restructuring charge for LFD in “Other Operations” of
$2.5 million ($3.8 million pre-tax). The objectives of
this restructuring plan were to combine channel oversight,
position LFD to take better advantage of ongoing
“marketplace consolidation” and to expand the customer
base of wholesalers in certain territories. The restructuring
plan identified severance and termination benefits of
$3.8 million (pre-tax) related to the elimination of
63 positions. Actual pre-tax costs totaling
$3.8 million have been expended and 62 positions have
been eliminated under this plan through December 31, 2002.
As of December 31, 2002, less than $0.1 million
remains in the restructuring reserve for this plan. Expenditures
under this restructuring plan are expected to be completed in
the first quarter of 2003.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, LNC recorded a
restructuring charge in “Other Operations” of
$15.8 million ($24.4 million pre-tax). The objectives
of this restructuring plan were to consolidate operations and
reduce excess space in LNC’s Fort Wayne, Indiana
operations. In light of LNC’s divestiture of its
reinsurance operations, which were headquartered in
Fort Wayne, excess space and printing capacity will not be
used. The restructuring plan identified the following activities
and associated pre-tax costs to achieve the



LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

objectives of the plan: (1) severance and
termination benefits of $0.3 million related to the
elimination of 9 positions; (2) write-off of leasehold
improvements of $3.2 million and (2) other costs of
$20.9 million primarily related to termination of equipment
leases ($1.4 million) and rent on abandoned office space
($19.5 million). In the third quarter of 2002,
$1.5 million of the restructuring reserve related to rent
was released. The release was due to LNC’s purchase and
ultimate sale of the vacant building on terms which were
favorable to what was included in the original restructuring
plan for rent on this abandoned office space. Actual pre-tax
costs totaling $22.3 million have been expended and
19 positions have been eliminated under this plan through
December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, a balance
of $0.6 million remains in the restructuring reserve for
this plan. Expenditures under this restructuring plan are
expected to be completed in 2004. LNC estimates an annual
reduction in future operating expenses of $4.6 million
(pre-tax) after the plan is fully implemented.

During the second quarter of 2002, Lincoln
Retirement completed a review of its entire internal information
technology organization. As a result of that review, Lincoln
Retirement decided in the second quarter of 2002 to reorganize
its IT organization in order to better align the activities and
functions conducted within its own organization and its IT
service providers. This change was made in order to focus
Lincoln Retirement on its goal of achieving a common
administrative platform for its annuities products, to better
position the organization and its service providers to respond
to changing market conditions, and to reduce overall costs in
response to increased competitive pressures. The segment
recorded a restructuring charge of $1.0 million
($1.6 million pre-tax). The restructuring plan identified
the following activities and associated pre-tax costs to achieve
the objectives of the plan: $1.4 million for employee
severance and $0.2 million for employee outplacement
relative to 49 eliminated positions. Actual pre-tax costs
totaling $0.9 million have been expended and
49 positions have been eliminated under this plan through
December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, a balance
of $0.7 million remains in the restructuring reserve for
this plan. The plan is expected to be completed in the third
quarter of 2003.

13.     Subsequent
Events

In January 2003, the Life Insurance segment
announced that it was realigning its operations in Hartford,
Connecticut and Schaumburg, Illinois to enhance productivity,
efficiency and scalability while positioning the segment for
future growth. The financial impact of the realignment will
result in the Life Insurance segment incurring costs of
approximately $15-$17 million after-tax during 2003.

In February 2003, Lincoln Retirement announced
plans to consolidate its fixed annuity operations in Schaumburg,
Illinois into Fort Wayne, Indiana. Restructuring costs
under the plan are expected to be $3-$5 million after-tax
and are expected to be incurred during 2003.



REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS

Board of Directors

Lincoln National Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Lincoln National Corporation as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These
financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the
Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Lincoln National Corporation
at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2002 the Corporation changed its method
of accounting for goodwill and its related amortization. As
discussed in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2001 the Corporation changed its method of
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as
well as its method of accounting for impairment of certain
investments.
