They may be accessed as follows: www.Emerson.com, Investors, SEC Filings. Information on the Company’s website does not constitute part of this Form 10-K.

The information set forth under Item 1A - "Risk Factors” is hereby incorporated by reference.

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS

Investing in our securities involves risks. We may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.

Our Strategic Portfolio Transactions, Including the Planned Sales of Our Network Power Systems Business and Our Power Generation, Motors and Drives Businesses, as Well as the Planned Acquisition of Pentair's Valves & Controls Business, May Not Be Completed Within the Currently Contemplated Time Frame, With the Expected Terms or Costs, and May Not Achieve the Intended Benefits

We make no assurance regarding the terms, timing, costs or benefits anticipated from the strategic portfolio transactions. Unforeseen developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax, regulatory and other approvals, could delay the proposed transactions, or cause them to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable, or at a higher cost, than expected.

Further, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial or other benefits of the strategic portfolio transactions. Moreover, after the transactions are completed, the Company will be smaller and less diversified, with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could adversely affect our business.

We Operate in Businesses That Are Subject to Competitive Pressures That Could Affect Prices or Demand for Our Products

Our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile, and we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. Our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment, including capital and consumer spending. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost. Various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the


number of competitors varies by product line. Some of our competitors have substantially greater sales, assets and financial resources than our Company and we also compete with many smaller companies. Competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products, impacting our sales or profit margins, and/or resulting in a loss of market share.

Our Operating Results Depend in Part on Continued Successful Research, Development and Marketing of New and/or Improved Products and Services, and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Successfully Introduce New Products and Services

The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.

If We Are Unable to Defend or Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights the Company's Competitive Position Could Be Adversely Affected

The Company's intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other confidential information. This intellectual property may be subject to challenge, infringement, invalidation or circumvention by third parties. Despite extensive security measures, our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems, employee theft, or other acts of industrial espionage. Should the Company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property, it may suffer competitive harm.

We Engage in Acquisitions and Divestitures, Which Are Subject to Domestic and Foreign Regulatory Requirements, and May Encounter Difficulties in Integrating and Separating These Businesses and Therefore We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits

We regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures. These activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions, and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In 2016 and in past years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business, and may continue to do so in the future. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We Use a Variety of Raw Materials and Components in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products

Our major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum, brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. The Company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events. Significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.


Our Operations Depend on Production Facilities Throughout the World, a Majority of Which Are Located Outside the United States and Subject to Increased Risks of Disrupted Production Causing Delays in Shipments and Loss of Customers and Revenue

We manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States, and also source certain materials internationally. Emerging market sales now represent over one-third of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our best-cost position. Our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strife, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences.

Our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws, policies and regulation in host countries, as well as economic and political upheaval, than our domestic facilities. These facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.

Our Substantial Sales Abroad Subject Us to Economic Risk as Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Changes in Local Government Regulations and Policies

We sell, manufacture, engineer and purchase products in overseas markets and a significant portion of our sales occur in mature and emerging markets outside the United States. We expect sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. International sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings, which could adversely affect our results. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.

Recessions, Adverse Market Conditions or Downturns in End Markets We Serve May Negatively Affect Our Operations

In the past, our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions, recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve. In the future, similar changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results and cash flows. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions and incur higher costs. If our restructuring actions are not sufficiently effective, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results. In addition, these factors could lead to impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets.

Access to Funding Through the Capital Markets Is Essential to the Execution of Our Business Plan and if We Are Unable to Maintain Such Access We Could Experience a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Financial Results

Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. Volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments, or affect the Company’s ability to access those markets. If we are unable to continue to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if our customers, suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the Company, our business could be adversely impacted.

Our Business Success Depends on the Ability to Attract, Develop and Retain Key Personnel

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. The failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results.


Security Breaches or Disruptions of Our Information Technology Systems Could Adversely Affect Our Business

The Company utilizes a variety of information technology systems to manage and operate its businesses.  Despite the implementation of extensive security measures (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring, and maintenance of backup and protective systems), the Company’s information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyberattack and other events, ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats. Although considered unlikely, it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information. Should the Company be unable to prevent security breaches, disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations, as well as expose the Company to litigation, increased cybersecurity protection costs and reputational damage.

We Are Subject to Litigation and Environmental Regulations That Could Adversely Impact Our Operating Results

We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving intellectual property, product liability and environmental matters, several of which claim, or may in the future claim, significant damages. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws.

ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

At

September 30, 2016

, the Company had approximately 205 manufacturing locations worldwide, of which approximately 135 were located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia, and to a lesser extent in Canada and Latin America. Manufacturing locations by business segment are: Process Management, 76; Industrial Automation, 32; Climate Technologies, 33; and Commercial & Residential Solutions, 14. There were approximately 50 manufacturing facilities related to businesses included in discontinued operations at September 30, 2016. The majority of the locations are owned, with the remainder occupied under lease. The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various legal proceedings, some of which claim substantial amounts of damages. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, but historically the Company has been largely successful in both prosecuting and defending claims and lawsuits.

The Company believes a material adverse impact of any pending litigation is unlikely. Nevertheless, given the uncertainties of litigation, a remote possibility exists that litigation could have a material adverse impact on the Company.

The information regarding legal proceedings set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is hereby incorporated by reference.

ITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Safe Harbor Statement

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning Emerson's operations, future results and prospects, including the planned separation of the network power systems business and the power generation, motors and drives businesses and other strategic repositioning actions. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - "Risk Factors," which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as our strategic repositioning actions, other acquisitions or divestitures, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management’s control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.

Underlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure:

net sales

).

Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense, net and income taxes) and total segment EBIT, and EBIT margin (defined as EBIT divided by net sales) and total segment EBIT margin, are commonly used financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes. All these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance (U.S. GAAP measures:

pretax earnings or pretax profit margin

).

Earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses, impairments, costs associated with the strategic portfolio repositioning actions, or other items provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items. Management believes that presenting earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders' equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the Company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors (U.S. GAAP measures:

earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity, return on total capital

).

Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) is an indicator of the Company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. The determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow is


useful to both management and investors as a measure of the Company’s ability to generate cash (U.S. GAAP measure:

operating cash flow

).

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Report of Management

The Company's management is responsible for the integrity and accuracy of the financial statements. Management believes that the financial statements for the three years ended

September 30, 2016

have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates where necessary to reflect the expected effects of events and transactions that have not been completed. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures ensure that material information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to management and reported within the required time periods.

In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial statements, management relies on a system of internal accounting control. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The design of this system recognizes that errors or irregularities may occur and that estimates and judgments are required to assess the relative cost and expected benefits of the controls. Management believes that the Company's internal accounting controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the financial statements are prevented or would be detected within a timely period.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee meets with management and the Company's internal auditors periodically to review the work of each and to monitor the discharge by each of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors, who have free access to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, to discuss the quality and acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and internal controls, as well as nonaudit-related services.

The independent auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Their opinions are based on procedures that they believe to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain no material errors and that the Company's internal controls are effective.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

September 30, 2016

.

The Company's auditor, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.


Results of Operations

Years ended September 30

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

OVERVIEW

These businesses have been reported within discontinued operations for all years presented.

Emerson's sales from continuing operations for


were

$14.5 billion

, a decrease of

$1,727 million

, or

11 percent

. Underlying sales were down

7 percent

compared with the prior year reflecting the negative impact of low oil and gas prices, weak industrial and emerging market business spending, and global economic uncertainty. Foreign currency translation subtracted

2 percent

13 percent

versus

$2.81

in the prior year. Gains from the prior year divestitures of the power transmission solutions and commercial storage businesses were $611 million in total, or $0.90 per share, which negatively impacted earnings and earnings per share comparisons by 20 and 21 percentage points, respectively.

Earnings from discontinued operations for 2016 were $45 million ($0.07 per share), which includes earnings from the operations of the network power systems, and power generation, motors and drives businesses of $344 million ($0.53 per share), and other items which reduced earnings by $299 million ($0.46 per share). See discussion below.


Net earnings common stockholders were

$1,635 million

in 2016, down

40 percent

compared with prior year earnings of

$2,710 million

versus

$3.17

in 2015.

Excluded items in 2016 include separation costs of $220 million ($0.34 per share), a loss of $103 million ($0.16 per share) to write down the power generation, motors and drives businesses to the sales price less costs to sell, and lower expense of $24 million ($0.04 per share benefit) due to ceasing depreciation and amortization for the discontinued businesses held-for-sale. Excluded items in 2015 include the divestiture gains of $611 million ($0.90 per share benefit) and separation costs of $52 million ($0.08 per share). In total, these items negatively impacted net earnings and earnings per share comparisons 30 and 31 percentage points, respectively.

Sales decreased in all segments. Process Management sales decreased

12 percent

and Industrial Automation sales were down

15 percent

(

7 percent

due to the power transmission solutions divestiture in 2015) as global oil and gas customers curtailed spending levels in a difficult environment and weakness in industrial spending persisted. Climate Technologies sales decreased

2 percent

, while Commercial & Residential Solutions sales decreased

16 percent

(

15 percent

due to the commercial storage divestiture in 2015).

The Company generated operating cash flow of

$2.9 billion

, of which

$2.5 billion

related to continuing operations. Operating cash flow from continuing operations increased

$459 million

in


as comparisons benefited from income taxes of

$424 million

paid in the prior year on the divestiture gains.

NET SALES

Net sales for


were

$14.5 billion

, a decrease of

$1,727 million

, or

11 percent

compared with


. Underlying sales, which exclude foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, decreased

7 percent

(

$1,046 million

) on 6 percent lower volume and 1 percent lower price. Foreign currency translation subtracted

2 percent

(

$266 million

) and divestitures, net of acquisitions subtracted

(

$415 million

). Underlying sales decreased

5 percent

in the U.S. and

$62 million

and Commercial & Residential Solutions decreased

$302 million

(

$288 million

due to the commercial storage divestiture in 2015).

Net sales for


were

$16.2 billion

, a decrease of

$1,484 million

, or

8 percent

compared with


. Underlying sales decreased 1 percent ($169 million) on volume declines. Foreign currency translation subtracted 4 percent ($717 million) and divestitures, net of acquisitions subtracted 3 percent ($598 million). Underlying sales were flat in the U.S. and decreased 2 percent internationally. Sales in Process Management decreased $673 million, Industrial Automation decreased $556 million and Climate Technologies decreased $98 million, while sales in Commercial & Residential Solutions increased slightly.

INTERNATIONAL SALES

Emerson is a global business with international sales representing 52 percent of total sales, including U.S. exports. Although economic conditions are currently soft worldwide, the Company generally expects faster economic growth in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Middle East/Africa in the future.

International destination sales, including U.S. exports, decreased 12 percent, to

$7.6 billion

in 2016, reflecting decreases in all segments, partially due to divestitures. U.S. exports of

$888 million

were down

25 percent

compared with 2015, reflecting reduced spending by global oil and gas customers, weakness in industrial spending and the stronger U.S. dollar. Underlying international destination sales declined 8 percent, as foreign currency translation and divestitures had a 3 percent and a 1 percent unfavorable impact, respectively, on the comparison. Underlying sales were up

2 percent

in Europe and decreased

10 percent

in both Asia and Latin America. Sales decreased

21 percent

in Canada and

15 percent

in Middle East/Africa. Continued weakness in energy-related and industrial end markets and global economic uncertainty has continued to challenge growth in these areas. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $6.8 billion in 2016, down 10 percent compared with 2015, reflecting the weakness in industrial capital spending, unfavorable foreign currency translation and divestitures.


International destination sales, including U.S. exports, decreased 12 percent, to

$8.6 billion

in 2015, primarily reflecting decreases in Process Management and Industrial Automation, partially due to the power transmission solutions divestiture. These decreases were partially offset by growth in Climate Technologies and Commercial & Residential Solutions. U.S. exports of $1.2 billion were down 8 percent compared with 2014. Underlying international destination sales declined 2 percent on lower volume, as foreign currency translation and divestitures had an 8 and 2 percent unfavorable impact, respectively, on the comparison. Underlying sales were flat in Europe, decreased 4 percent in Asia (China down 9 percent) and 10 percent in Latin America, and were flat in Canada. Sales in Middle East/Africa increased 5 percent. The slowdown in industrial capital spending, particularly in oil and gas, hampered growth in these areas. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $7.5 billion in 2015, down 12 percent compared with 2014, reflecting the slowdown in industrial capital spending, unfavorable foreign currency translation and divestitures.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

See information under “Discontinued Operations” for a discussion of the Company’s divestitures related to its portfolio repositioning actions.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase Pentair's Valves & Controls business for $3.15 billion, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. This business, with sales of approximately $1.6 billion, is a manufacturer of controls, isolation and pressure relief valves and actuators, and will complement the Process Management segment's final control business. The transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar year 2016 or shortly thereafter, subject to customary closing conditions and various regulatory approvals. The Company acquired six businesses in 2016, four in Process Management's final control and measurement devices businesses and two in Climate Technologies. Total cash paid for these businesses was $132 million, net of cash acquired.  Annualized sales for these businesses were approximately $51 million in 2016. These acquisitions complement the existing segment portfolios and create incremental growth opportunities. See Note 3 and Item 1A - "Risk Factors."

The Company completed

eight

acquisitions in 2015, seven in Process Management and one in Commercial & Residential Solutions, which had combined annualized sales of approximately

$115 million

. Total cash paid for all businesses was

$324 million

, net of cash acquired.

In January 2015, the Company completed the sale of its mechanical power transmission solutions business to Regal Beloit Corporation for

$1.4 billion

, and recognized a pretax gain from the transaction of

$939 million

(

$532 million

after-tax,

$0.78

per share). Proceeds from the divestiture were used for share repurchase. This business was previously reported in the Industrial Automation segment, and had partial year sales of

$189 million

in 2015 and related pretax earnings of

$21 million

. Power transmission solutions designs and manufactures market-leading couplings, bearings, conveying components and gearing and drive components, and provides supporting services and solutions.

On September 30, 2015, the Company sold its InterMetro commercial storage business to Ali Group of Italy for

$411 million

in cash and recognized a pretax gain from the transaction of

$100 million

(

$79 million

after-tax,

$0.12

per share). This business had annual sales of

$288 million

and pretax earnings of

$42 million

in 2015, and was included in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment. InterMetro is a leading manufacturer and supplier of storage and transport products in the food service, commercial products and health care industries.

In 2014, the Company acquired Virgo Valves and Enardo Holdings, manufacturers of engineered valves and automation systems, and tank and terminal safety equipment, respectively. Both businesses are reported in Process Management and complement the existing portfolio. The Company also acquired four other smaller businesses in 2014, in Process Management and Network Power. Combined annualized sales for all businesses acquired in 2014 were approximately $376 million.  The Company also acquired the remaining 44.5 percent noncontrolling interest in the Appleton Group electrical distribution business, in the Industrial Automation segment, in 2014.  Sales for this business were $542 million in 2014. Full ownership of Appleton provides growth opportunities in oil and gas and chemicals end markets.

Early in 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of a 51 percent controlling interest in Artesyn and received net proceeds of $264 million. The Company used the sale proceeds and cash repatriated from the business to purchase common stock. Late in 2014, the Company sold its connectivity solutions business for $99 million in cash.


COST OF SALES

Cost of sales for


were

$8.3 billion

, a decrease of

$981 million

compared with

$9.2 billion

in


, primarily due to reduced sales volume, the impact of foreign currency translation ($186 million) and prior year divestitures ($273 million). Gross profit was

$6.3 billion

in


compared to

$7.0 billion

in


. Gross margin of

43.1 percent

was flat compared with


, as savings from cost reduction and containment actions were offset by deleverage on lower volume and unfavorable mix.

Cost of sales for 2015 were

$9.2 billion

, a decrease of

$730 million

compared with

$10.0 billion

in 2014, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation ($459 million), divestitures ($425 million), lower sales volume and the benefit of cost reduction efforts. Gross profit was

$7.0 billion

in 2015 compared with

$7.8 billion

in 2014. Gross margin of

43.1 percent

decreased 0.7 percentage points versus

43.8 percent

in 2014 due to deleverage on the lower volume, unfavorable mix and the impact of the stronger dollar on product costs, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. Divestitures had a 0.4 percentage point favorable impact on margin.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of

$3.5 billion

in 2016 decreased

$271 million

compared with 2015. The decrease reflects savings from cost reduction actions, reduced costs from lower sales volume, and prior year divestitures ($137 million), partially offset by higher incentive stock compensation of

$121 million

. SG&A as a percent of sales of

23.8 percent

increased 0.8 percent in 2016, reflecting deleverage on lower sales volume and higher incentive stock compensation, primarily due to changes in the stock price and overlap of awards, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions.

SG&A expenses of

$3.7 billion

in 2015 decreased

$429 million

compared with 2014. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency translation ($155 million), divestitures ($131 million), reduced costs from lower sales volume, and lower incentive stock compensation of

$99 million

. SG&A as a percent of sales was

23.0 percent

in 2015, a 0.5 percentage point decrease compared with

23.5 percent

in 2014, as deleverage on the lower volume was more than offset by savings from restructuring actions and lower incentive stock compensation expense.

GAINS ON DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES

In 2015, the Company sold its power transmission solutions and commercial storage businesses and recorded  pretax gains of

$939 million

(

$532 million

after-tax,

$0.78

per share) and

$100 million

(

$79 million

after-tax,

$0.12

per share), respectively. See Note 3.

OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET

Other deductions, net were

$294 million

in


, a

$36 million

decrease from


primarily due to lower restructuring costs of

$42 million

, decreased litigation costs of $30 million and a $21 million gain on payments received related to dumping duties. The decrease in other deductions was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency transactions of

$67 million

. See Note 5.

Other deductions, net were

$330 million

in 2015, a

$119 million

increase from 2014 primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs of

$99 million

, higher litigation costs of $29 million and unfavorable foreign currency transactions of $15 million, partially offset by a favorable comparative effect from a $34 million equity investment loss in the prior year. The Company accelerated restructuring activity in 2015 to address the global slowdown in capital spending and position itself for future growth.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET

Interest expense, net was

$188 million

,

$175 million

and

$196 million

in


,


and


, respectively. The decrease of

$21 million

in


primarily resulted from the maturity of long-term debt with relatively higher interest rates.

INCOME TAXES

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

As of July 29, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its network power systems business for

$4.0 billion

in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and will retain a subordinated interest in distributions, contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold return on their initial investment. This business comprised the former Network Power segment and provides mission-critical infrastructure products and solutions and life cycle management services for vital applications in data centers, communication networks, and commercial/industrial environments. Also, on July 30, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its power generation, motors and drives businesses for a value of

$1.2 billion

, representing cash plus assumption of certain postretirement liabilities by the buyer, subject to post-closing adjustments. These businesses were previously reported in the Industrial Automation segment, and provide low, medium and high voltage alternators and other power generation equipment and commercial and industrial motors and drives, which are used in a wide variety of manufacturing and industrial applications. Both transactions are expected to close by the end of calendar year 2016 subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, and will result in a smaller and more focused Company, with leadership positions in higher-growth end markets that provide significant opportunities for enhanced growth and improved profitability. The results of operations for these businesses have been reclassified into discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities are reflected as held-for-sale for all periods presented. See Note 4 and Item 1A - "Risk Factors."

The businesses included in discontinued operations had combined annual sales of

$5,746 million

,

$6,094 million

and

$6,842 million

and net earnings (loss) of $45 million, $193 million and $(54) million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net earnings of $45 million ($0.07 per share) in 2016 include earnings from the operations of the network power systems, and power generation, motors and drives businesses of $344 million ($0.53 per share), and other items which reduced earnings by $299 million ($0.46 per share). Other items for 2016 include separation costs to execute the portfolio repositioning of $220 million ($0.34 per share), comprised of income tax expense of $143 million for repatriation of cash from these businesses, reorganization of their legal structures prior to sale, and basis differences for book and tax, as well as costs for legal, consulting, investment banking and other expenses of $77 million. In addition, net earnings for 2016 include a loss of $103 million ($0.16 per share) to write down the power generation, motors and drives businesses to the sales price less costs to sell, and lower expense of $24 million ($0.04 per share benefit) due to ceasing depreciation and amortization for the discontinued businesses held-for-sale. Earnings for 2015 include separation costs of $52 million, comprised of income taxes of $42 million and fees of $10 million, and earnings for 2014 include a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $508 million related to the network power systems business in Europe. Operating cash flow from discontinued operations was

$382 million

(reduced by payments of $179 million for separation costs),

$489 million

and

$693 million

and capital expenditures were

$76 million

,

$97 million

and

$116 million

for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Upon completion of the transactions, the Company preliminarily expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $500 million and to break even after-tax, subject to finalization of several matters including separation costs to complete the transactions. In addition, the Company may incur U.S. tax costs of approximately $200 million for repatriation of estimated sales proceeds of $1.5 billion expected to be received offshore in connection with the transactions. The Company's decision whether to repatriate these proceeds will be determined in connection with funding needs for the acquisition of Pentair's Valves & Controls non-U.S. operations.


NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE; RETURNS ON EQUITY AND TOTAL CAPITAL

Net earnings attributable to common stockholders in


were

$1,635 million

, down

40 percent

compared with 2015, and diluted earnings per share were

$2.52

, down

37 percent

. Separation costs and other items negatively impacted earnings $299 million ($0.46 per share) in 2016, while divestiture gains and other items benefited earnings $559 million ($0.82 per share) in 2015. Combined, these items negatively impacted net earnings and earnings per share comparisons 30 and 31 percentage points, respectively.

Other items in 2016 include separation costs of $220 million ($0.34 per share), a loss of $103 million ($0.16 per share) to write down the power generation, motors and drives businesses to the sales price less costs to sell, and lower expense of $24 million ($0.04 per share benefit) due to ceasing depreciation and amortization for the discontinued businesses held-for-sale. Items in 2015 include the divestiture gains of $611 million ($0.90 per share benefit) and separation costs of $52 million ($0.08 per share).

Net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2015 were $2,710 million, up 26 percent compared with 2014, and diluted earnings per share were $3.99, up 32 percent. Combined, the gains from divestitures and separation costs in 2015, and the goodwill impairment charge in 2014, benefited net earnings and earnings per share comparisons 45 and 47 percentage points, respectively.

Return on common stockholders' equity (net earnings attributable to common stockholders divided by average common stockholders' equity) was

20.9 percent

in


compared with

29.8 percent

in


and

20.7 percent

in


. Return on total capital was

15.5 percent

in


compared with

22.8 percent

in


and

17.5 percent

in


(computed as net earnings attributable to common stockholders excluding after-tax net interest expense, divided by average common stockholders' equity plus short- and long-term debt less cash and short-term investments). Combined, the separation costs related to the portfolio repositioning actions, the loss related to the sale of the power generation, motors and drives businesses, and the lower depreciation and amortization expense for the discontinued businesses held-for-sale reduced the 2016 returns on common stockholders' equity and total capital approximately 3 percentage points. For 2015, the combined impact of divestitures and the separation costs increased the returns on common stockholders' equity and total capital approximately 6 and 5 percentage points, respectively. The goodwill impairment charge in


reduced the returns on common stockholders' equity and total capital approximately 3 percentage points.

Business Segments

Following is an analysis of segment results for


compared with


, and


compared with


.

The Company defines segment earnings as earnings before interest and income taxes.


vs.


- Process Management reported sales of

$7.5 billion

in


, a decrease of

$1,032 million

or

12 percent

. Underlying sales decreased

11 percent

(

$911 million

) on 10 percent lower volume and 1 percent lower price as global oil and gas customers continued to curtail spending levels in a difficult environment. Foreign currency translation had a

2 percent

(

$178 million

) unfavorable impact while acquisitions added

1 percent

(

$57 million

). The measurement devices, final control and systems and solutions businesses were all down. Underlying sales decreased

10 percent

in the U.S., were up

2 percent

in Europe and decreased

14 percent

in Asia (China down

18 percent

). Latin America decreased

14 percent

, Canada decreased

29 percent

and Middle East/Africa was down

19 percent

. Earnings decreased

$362 million

and margin was down

2.4

percentage points due to sharply lower volume, deleverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by savings from cost reduction actions and lower restructuring costs of

$15 million

. Materials cost containment offset lower pricing. Results also reflect unfavorable foreign currency transactions of $69 million, partially offset by a favorable comparison from litigation costs of $20 million in 2015. Results will remain under pressure through the majority of fiscal 2017 on continuing weakness in key served markets, particularly upstream oil and gas. Activity in life sciences and power had positive sales growth in 2016 and is expected to have continued growth in 2017.



vs.


- Process Management reported sales of $8.5 billion in 2015, a decrease of $673 million or 7 percent. Underlying sales decreased 2 percent ($221 million) as persistent low oil and gas prices reduced capital and operating spending, especially in upstream markets. Foreign currency translation had an additional 5 percent ($481 million) unfavorable impact while acquisitions ($29 million) provided a slight benefit. The measurement devices, final control and systems and solutions businesses all declined. Underlying sales were flat in the U.S., up 1 percent in Europe and decreased 6 percent in Asia (China down 9 percent). Latin America decreased 14 percent and Canada decreased 1 percent, while Middle East/Africa was up 2 percent. Earnings decreased $425 million and margin was down 3.4 percentage points due to lower volume and deleverage, unfavorable mix and the impact of a stronger dollar on operations. Increased restructuring costs of $72 million, higher costs related to growth investments initiated in the prior year and other items were offset by savings from cost reduction actions.


vs.


- Industrial Automation sales were

$2.1 billion

in


, a decrease of

$376 million

or

15 percent

. Underlying sales decreased

7 percent

(

$159 million

) on 5 percent lower volume and 2 percent lower price, reflecting weakness in industrial spending and upstream oil and gas markets. Additionally, the power transmission solutions divestiture deducted

7 percent

(

$189 million

) and foreign currency translation subtracted

1 percent

(

$28 million

). The sales decrease was led by the electrical distribution, fluid automation and hermetic motors businesses. Underlying sales decreased

9 percent

in the U.S., were up

1 percent

in Europe and decreased

7 percent

in Asia. Sales decreased

10 percent

in Latin America,

7 percent

in Canada and

4 percent

in Middle East/Africa. Earnings of

$458 million

were down

$51 million

, or 10 percent, due to the power transmission solutions divestiture, which negatively impacted the earnings comparison $19 million, and lower volume, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. Materials cost containment offset lower pricing. Margin increased

1.3

percentage points reflecting cost reduction actions and the impact of the divestiture, partially offset by deleverage on the lower volume. Conditions in served markets are expected to remain challenging in 2017, with the best opportunity for orders growth in the second half of the fiscal year.


vs.


- Industrial Automation sales were $2.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of $556 million or 19 percent. Underlying sales decreased 2 percent ($43 million) on lower volume, reflecting reduced industrial spending, particularly in energy-related and commodity markets. The power transmission solutions divestiture deducted 13 percent ($418 million) and foreign currency translation subtracted 4 percent

($95 million). Sales decreased in the electrical distribution and fluid automation businesses. Hermetic motors decreased moderately while the materials joining business was flat. Underlying sales decreased 4 percent in the U.S., while sales were up 1 percent in Europe and 5 percent in Asia. Sales decreased 2 percent in Latin America, 4 percent in Canada and 17 percent in Middle East/Africa. Earnings of $509 million were down $131 million and margin decreased 0.5 percentage points, due to the power transmission solutions divestiture, which negatively impacted the earnings comparison $67 million, unfavorable mix and higher restructuring costs of

$9 million

, partially offset by cost containment actions.


vs.


- Sales for Climate Technologies were

$3.9 billion

in


, a decrease of

$62 million

, or nearly

2 percent

. Underlying sales decreased less than

1 percent

(

$18 million

) on lower price, offset by slightly higher volume. Foreign currency translation deducted

1 percent

(

$49 million

), while acquisitions added

$5 million

. Global


air conditioning sales were down while global refrigeration sales were up modestly, as the U.S. exhibited growth and Europe and China were down, with more significant declines in air conditioning. Sales of temperature controls, sensors and solutions decreased. Overall, underlying sales were up

1 percent

in the U.S. and

2 percent

in Europe, while Asia was down

5 percent

. Latin America was down

1 percent

and Middle East/Africa and Canada were both down

2 percent

. Earnings of

$769 million

increased

$71 million

and margin increased

2.1

percentage points primarily due to savings from restructuring actions and materials cost containment, partially offset by lower price and higher customer accommodation costs. Sales growth in the low single-digits is expected for fiscal 2017, supported by a favorable outlook for global demand in air conditioning and refrigeration.


vs.


- Sales for Climate Technologies were $4.0 billion in 2015, a decrease of $98 million, or over 2 percent due to unfavorable foreign currency translation ($112 million). Underlying sales were up slightly ($14 million) as an increase in the global refrigeration business was essentially offset by a decrease in air conditioning. The temperature controls and sensors businesses were flat. Air conditioning sales in the U.S., Europe and China decreased while the rest of the world had strong growth. Global refrigeration was up modestly with growth in the U.S. and Asia and weakness in Europe. Overall, underlying sales were flat in the U.S., down 2 percent in Asia (China down 12 percent) and decreased 1 percent in Europe. Latin America was down 4 percent, Middle East/Africa was up 26 percent and Canada increased 13 percent. Earnings of $698 million decreased $39 million and margin declined 0.5 percentage points primarily due to unfavorable mix. Growth investments, and higher restructuring costs and unfavorable foreign currency transactions of $6 million each, were more than offset by cost reduction savings.


vs.


- Commercial & Residential Solutions sales were

$1.6 billion

in


, a decrease of

$302 million

or

16 percent

. Underlying sales were essentially flat (down

$3 million

), foreign currency translation deducted

1 percent

(

$11 million

) and the commercial storage divestiture deducted

15 percent

(

$288 million

). Food waste disposers had solid sales growth and the wet/dry vacuums business was up modestly, while sales decreased moderately in the professional tools and storage businesses. Underlying sales were flat in both the U.S. and internationally. Earnings of

$384 million

were down

$19 million

as the divestiture subtracted $39 million. Cost reduction actions, materials cost containment and lower restructuring costs of

$9 million

partially offset the decrease. Margin improved

2.7

percentage points due to the divestiture and cost containment actions. The expectation for favorable U.S. construction markets supports the outlook for low single-digit growth in fiscal 2017.


vs.


- Commercial & Residential Solutions sales were $1.9 billion in 2015, an increase of $22 million or 1 percent. Underlying sales increased 2 percent ($50 million) on higher volume from favorable U.S. construction markets, while foreign currency translation deducted 1 percent ($28 million). The sales increase was led by strong growth in wet/dry vacuums and modest growth in food waste disposers. The professional tools and commercial storage businesses decreased. Underlying sales were up 3 percent in the U.S. and 1 percent internationally. Earnings of $403 million were down $18 million and margin declined 1.2 percentage points as higher volume and resulting leverage was more than offset by unfavorable mix, higher restructuring costs of

$9 million

, and investments in growth programs.


Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity

The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and has the resources available to reinvest for growth in existing businesses, pursue strategic acquisitions and manage its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis.

The Company generated total operating cash flow of

$2.9 billion

in 2016, which was reduced by payments of $179 million for separation costs related to the portfolio repositioning. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2016 was

$2.5 billion

, a

$459 million

, or

23 percent

increase compared with


as comparisons benefited from income taxes of $424 million paid in the prior year on the divestiture gains. Operating cash flow from continuing operations of

$2.0 billion

in


was a

32 percent

decrease compared to

$3.0 billion

in


due to income taxes paid on the gains from divestitures in 2015, an increase in operating working capital, and lower earnings (excluding the divestiture gains). At

September 30, 2016

, operating working capital as a percent of sales improved to

5.2 percent

, compared with

7.2 percent

and

5.9 percent

in


and


, respectively. Total operating cash flow of $2.9 billion funded capital expenditures of

$523 million

including discontinued operations, repayments of long-term debt of

$254 million

, acquisitions of

$132 million

, dividends of

$1,227 million

and common stock purchases of

$601 million

in 2016. Contributions to pension plans were

$66 million

in


,

$53 million

in


and

$130 million

in


.

Capital expenditures related to continuing operations were

$447 million

,

$588 million

and

$651 million

in


,


and


, respectively. Free cash flow from continuing operations (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) was

$2.1 billion

in


, up

41 percent

, reflecting higher operating cash flow and lower capital expenditures. Free cash flow was

$1.5 billion

in


, compared with

$2.3 billion

in


, reflecting higher operating cash flow in 2014. The Company is targeting capital spending of approximately $500 million in


. Net cash paid in connection with acquisitions was

$132 million

,

$324 million

and

$610 million

in


,


and


, respectively. In 2014, the Company also purchased the noncontrolling interest in Appleton Group for $574 million. Proceeds from divestitures were

$1,812 million

and

$363 million

in


and


, respectively.

Dividends were

$1,227 million

(

$1.90

per share) in


, compared with

$1,269 million

(

$1.88

per share) in


and

$1,210 million

(

$1.72

per share) in


. In November 2016, the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend 1 percent, to an annualized rate of $1.92 per share.

Purchases of Emerson common stock totaled

$601 million

,

$2,487 million

and

$971 million

in


,


and


, respectively, at average per share prices of $48.11, $57.68 and $65.54. The Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 70 million common shares in November 2015, and 63.5 million shares remain available for purchase under this authorization. The Company purchased 12.5 million shares in


under a combination of the November 2015 authorization and the remainder of the May 2013 authorization. A total of 43.1 million shares were purchased in


and 14.8 million shares were purchased in 2014, both under the May 2013 authorization.

The sale of the network power systems business and power generation, motors and drives businesses will provide over $4 billion of cash, after tax, which the Company expects to use to fund the acquisition of Pentair's Valves & Controls business and potential future acquisitions.


Total debt, which includes long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, was

$6.6 billion

,

$6.8 billion

and $6.0 billion for


,


and


, respectively. During the year, the Company repaid

$250 million

of

4.75%

notes that matured in October 2015. In 2015, the Company issued $500 million of 2.625% notes due December 2021 and $500 million of 3.150% notes due June 2025, and repaid $250 million of 5.0% notes that matured in December 2014 and $250 million of 4.125% notes that matured in April 2015. In 2014, the Company repaid $250 million of 5.625% notes that matured in November 2013.

The total debt-to-capital ratio and the net debt-to-net capital ratio (less cash and short-term investments) increased in 2016 due to lower common stockholders' equity from share repurchases and changes in other comprehensive income. The total debt-to-capital ratio and the net debt-to-net capital ratio increased in 2015 primarily due to higher total debt from the issuance of long-term debt and lower common stockholders' equity. The operating cash flow from continuing operations-to-debt ratio increased in


primarily due to taxes paid in the prior year on the divestiture gains and lower debt in the current year. The interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus interest expense, divided by interest expense. The decrease in interest coverage in 2016 reflects lower pretax earnings, largely due to the divestiture gains of $1,039 million in 2015, and slightly higher interest expense. The increase in interest coverage in 2015 reflects higher pretax earnings (including the divestiture gains) and lower interest expense.

In April 2014, the Company entered into a $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility with various banks, which replaced the December 2010 $2.75 billion facility. The credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowing. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate and currency denomination alternatives at the Company's option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial. The Company also maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.

Emerson's financial structure provides the flexibility necessary to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth. At

September 30, 2016

, $2.9 billion of the Company's cash was held outside the U.S., primarily in Europe and Asia, and was generally available for repatriation to the U.S. Under current tax law, repatriated cash may be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, net of available foreign tax credits. The Company routinely repatriates a portion of its non-U.S. cash from earnings each year, or otherwise when it can be accomplished tax efficiently, and provides for U.S. income taxes as appropriate. The Company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet the Company's needs in the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity or backup credit lines.


CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

At

September 30, 2016

, the Company's contractual obligations, including estimated payments, are as follows:

Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements. Total purchase and operating lease obligations related to discontinued operations, which are not included in the table above, were $251 million and $193 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016. These obligations will be transferred to the buyers at closing. The table above does not include

$1.7 billion

of other noncurrent liabilities recorded in the balance sheet and summarized in Note 19, which consist primarily of pension and postretirement plan liabilities and deferred income taxes (including unrecognized tax benefits), because it is not certain when these amounts will become due. See Notes 11 and 12 for estimated future benefit payments and Note 14 for additional information on deferred income taxes.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, and selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forwards, swaps and purchased options to manage these risks. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. The value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements. Based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates, a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the U.S. dollar across all currencies, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material. Sensitivity analysis has limitations; for example, a weaker U.S. dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of non-U.S. operating results, and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales. See Notes 1, and 8 through 10.

Critical Accounting Policies

Preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company recognizes nearly all revenue through the sale of manufactured products and records the sale when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and collection is reasonably assured. In certain limited circumstances, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, as performance occurs, or in accordance with ASC 985-605 related to software. Sales arrangements sometimes involve delivering multiple elements, which requires management judgment that affects the amount and timing of revenue recognized. In these instances, the revenue assigned to each element is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence or a management estimate of the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized for delivered elements if they have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and performance related to the undelivered items is probable and substantially in the Company's control, or the undelivered elements are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingencies related to payment. The vast majority of deliverables are tangible products, with a smaller portion attributable to installation, service or maintenance. Management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing revenue.


INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of inventory values are based on standard costs, which approximate average costs, while the remainder are principally valued on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each year. The annual effect of resetting standards plus any operating variances incurred during each period are allocated to inventories and recognized in cost of sales as product is sold. The Company's businesses review inventory for obsolescence, make appropriate provisions and dispose of obsolete inventory on a regular basis. Various factors are considered in these reviews, including sales history and recent trends, industry conditions and general economic conditions. If actual circumstances indicate a decline in any of these factors, particularly an abrupt change in economic conditions, the Company could incur higher levels of obsolescence expense.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist. If the Company determines that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is evaluated by comparing the unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk. Estimates of future sales, operating results, cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including such factors as the general level of market interest rates, expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served, particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the evaluations.

RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company maintains a prudent long-term investment strategy for its pension assets, consistent with the duration of its pension obligations. The determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions, including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases. Management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate; however, actual experience may differ. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the Company's assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods. The Company transitioned from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans in 2016. The principal U.S. defined benefit plan closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured current employees ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016. Affected employees transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution plan. See Notes 11 and 12.

, and is expected to be 7.25 percent for 2017. Deferred actuarial losses to be amortized to expense in future years were

$1,916 million

($1,248 million after-tax) as of

September 30, 2016

.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid (received) on items included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies.


Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

The Company also pays U.S. federal income taxes, net of available foreign tax credits, on cash repatriated from non-U.S. locations. No provision is made for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries where these earnings are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely retained for continuing international operations. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Notes 1 and 14.

Other Items

LEGAL MATTERS

At

September 30, 2016

, there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May 2014, the FASB amended ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, to update and consolidate revenue recognition guidance from multiple sources into a single, comprehensive standard to be applied for all contracts with customers. The fundamental principle of the revised standard is to recognize revenue based on the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. Also required are additional disclosures regarding the nature, extent, timing and uncertainty of revenues and associated cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The new rules may be adopted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the revised standard on its financial statements and determining its method of adoption. The Company has completed its initial evaluation and currently does not expect that the updates will materially impact its financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB amended ASC 842,

Leases

, to require recognition on the balance sheet of assets and liabilities related to the rights and obligations associated with all lease arrangements. Currently, obligations classified as operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet but must be disclosed. The new standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the revised standard on its financial statements. The Company expects the revised standard to have a material impact on its balance sheet due to the addition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to operating leases, but does not expect it will materially impact its results of operations.

In November 2015, the FASB issued updates to ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, requiring noncurrent presentation of all deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. These updates are effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with early adoption permitted, and may be adopted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the revised standard on its financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB amended ASC 718,

Compensation - Stock Compensation

, requiring all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to share-based payments to be recognized in income tax expense rather than through additional paid-in-capital, and to be presented as operating cash flows instead of financing. These updates are effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with early adoption permitted, and are not expected to materially impact the Company's financial statements.

In May 2015, the FASB issued updates to ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement

, requiring investments measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient to be removed from the fair value hierarchy and separately reported when making disclosures. The updates have no impact on operations and do not change the determination of fair value for any investments. These updates are effective for the Company in fiscal 2017 and must be adopted on a retrospective basis. Adoption will affect disclosure only; there will be no impact on the Company’s financial results.


FISCAL 2017 OUTLOOK

Fiscal 2017 will remain difficult, particularly for the automation businesses. Low growth economic conditions coupled with political uncertainty will continue to dampen both operational and capital spending across multiple end markets. Considering these factors, the Company expects net and underlying sales in the Automation Solutions business to be down 4 to 7 percent. The Commercial & Residential Solutions business is expected to have support from more favorable global HVAC and U.S. construction markets resulting in net and underlying sales growth of 2 to 4 percent. Consolidated net and underlying sales for 2017 are expected to decline 1 to 3 percent. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be $2.35 to $2.50, compared with $2.45 in 2016. This outlook excludes the impact of the pending acquisition of Pentair’s Valves & Controls business. See Item 1 - “Business” for a description of the Company’s planned business realignment for fiscal 2017.

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Financial Statement Presentation

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles

(U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

In the first quarter of 2015, the Company adopted updates to ASC 205,

Presentation of Financial Statements

, and ASC 360,

Property, Plant and Equipment

, regarding the reporting of discontinued operations. These updates raised the threshold for reporting discontinued operations to a strategic business shift having a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The updates also added disclosures for disposals of business units qualifying for discontinued presentation, and for some dispositions that do not qualify as discontinued operations but are still considered individually significant components of the entity. The Company's previously announced strategic portfolio repositioning actions resulted in agreements to sell the network power systems business and the power generation, motors and drives businesses. The results of operations for these businesses have been reclassified into discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities are reflected as held-for-sale for all periods presented. See Note 4.

In the first quarter of 2014, the Company adopted revisions to ASC 220,

Comprehensive Income

, which require disclosure of reclassifications into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and other current period activity. There is no change to the items reported in AOCI or when those items should be reclassified into earnings. The revisions did not materially impact the Company’s financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled affiliates. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments of

20 percent

to

50 percent

of the voting shares of other entities are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in publicly traded companies of less than

20 percent

are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in nonpublicly traded companies of less than

20 percent

are carried at cost.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for most of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of inventory is valued based on standard costs that approximate average costs, while the remainder is principally valued on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each fiscal year. The annual effect of resetting standards plus any operating variances incurred during each period are allocated to inventories and recognized in cost of sales as product is sold. Following are the components of inventory as of September 30:


Fair Value Measurement

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement

, establishes a formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain financial statement items at fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements and the reliability of valuation inputs. Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Within the hierarchy, Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for an identical item in active markets and have the most reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer quotation or other approaches using market-observable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and spot prices, interest rates and volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an active market, such as company-developed future cash flow estimates, and are considered the least reliable. Valuations for all of the Company's financial instruments fall within Level 2. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is Level 2, estimated using current interest rates and pricing from financial institutions and other market sources for debt with similar maturities and characteristics.

Property, Plant And Equipment

The Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal assets are


to

40 years

for buildings and


to

12 years

for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than the carrying values. The components of property, plant and equipment as of September 30 follow:

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. Substantially all goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that acquires a business. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280,

Segment Reporting

, or a business one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information for that business unit is prepared and regularly reviewed by the segment manager. The Company conducts annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a unit may be less than its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recognized to the extent that recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures and are developed generally under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates.

All of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 7.

Product Warranty

Warranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties generally extend for a period of

one

to

two

years from the date of sale or installation. Provisions for warranty are determined primarily based on historical warranty cost as a percentage of sales or a fixed amount per unit sold based on failure rates, adjusted for specific problems that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than

1 percent

of sales.


Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes nearly all of its revenues through the sale of manufactured products and records the sale when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and collection is reasonably assured. In certain limited circumstances, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as performance occurs, or in accordance with ASC 985-605 related to software. Management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing revenue.

Sales arrangements sometimes involve delivering multiple elements. In these instances, the revenue assigned to each element is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence or a management estimate of the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized individually for delivered elements if they have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and the performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in the Company's control, or the undelivered elements are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingencies related to payment. Approximately

5 percent

of the Company's revenues from continuing operations arise from qualifying sales arrangements that include the delivery of multiple elements, principally in the Process Management segment. The vast majority of these deliverables are tangible products, with a smaller portion attributable to installation, service or maintenance. Generally, contract duration is short term, and cancellation, termination or refund provisions apply only in the event of contract breach and have historically not been invoked.

Derivatives and Hedging

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices due to its worldwide presence and diverse business profile. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its business units, primarily in euros, Mexican pesos, Singapore dollars and Indian rupees. Primary commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum and related products. As part of the Company's risk management strategy, derivative instruments are selectively used in an effort to minimize the impact of these exposures. Foreign exchange forwards and options are utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments and the fair value of assets and liabilities, while swap and option contracts may be used to minimize the effect of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of sales. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The duration of hedge positions is generally

two years

or less.

All derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, the effective portion of any gain or loss is deferred in stockholders' equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The majority of the Company's derivatives that are designated as hedges and qualify for deferral accounting are cash flow hedges. For derivatives hedging the fair value of existing assets or liabilities, both the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in earnings each period. Currency fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar obligations that have been designated as hedges of non-U.S. dollar net asset exposures are reported in equity. To the extent that any hedge is not fully effective at offsetting changes in the underlying hedged item, there could be a net earnings impact. The Company also uses derivatives to hedge economic exposures that do not receive deferral accounting under ASC 815. The underlying exposures for these hedges relate primarily to purchases of commodity-based components used in the Company's manufacturing processes, and the revaluation of certain foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains or losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge, as well as any gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedges, are recognized in the income statement immediately.

Counterparties to derivative arrangements are companies with high credit ratings, and the Company has bilateral collateral arrangements with them for which credit rating-based posting thresholds vary depending on the arrangement. If credit ratings on the Company's debt fall below preestablished levels, counterparties can require immediate full collateralization on all instruments in net liability positions.

No

collateral was posted with counterparties and

none

was held by the Company at year end. If contractual thresholds had been exceeded, the maximum collateral the Company could have been required to post was

$47

. The Company can also demand full collateralization of instruments in net asset positions should any of the Company's counterparties' credit ratings fall below certain thresholds. Risk from credit loss when derivatives are in asset positions is not considered material. The Company has master netting arrangements in place with its counterparties that allow the offsetting of certain derivative-related amounts receivable and payable when settlement occurs in the same period. Accordingly, counterparty balances are netted in the consolidated balance sheet and are reported in other current assets or accrued expenses as appropriate, depending on positions with counterparties as of the balance sheet date. See Note 8.


Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is based on pretax income reported in the consolidated statements of earnings and tax rates currently enacted in each jurisdiction. Certain income and expense items are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting and income tax filing purposes, and deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences. The Company also provides for U.S. federal income taxes, net of available foreign tax credits, on earnings intended to be repatriated from non-U.S. locations. No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes on approximately

$5.2 billion

of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016, as these earnings are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely retained for continuing international operations. Recognition of U.S. taxes on undistributed non-U.S. earnings would be triggered by a management decision to repatriate those earnings. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Note 14.

(2)  WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES

Basic earnings per common share consider only the weighted-average of common shares outstanding while diluted earnings per common share also consider the dilutive effects of stock options and incentive shares. Options to purchase approximately

13.3 million

,

5.9 million

and

4.6 million

shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as the effect would have been antidilutive. Earnings allocated to participating securities were inconsequential for all years presented. Reconciliations of weighted-average shares for basic and diluted earnings per common share follow (shares in millions):

(3)  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

The Company acquired

six

businesses in 2016,

four

in Process Management's final control and measurement devices businesses and

two

in Climate Technologies. Total cash paid for these businesses was

$132

, net of cash acquired. Annualized sales for these businesses were approximately

$51

in 2016. The Company recognized goodwill of

$83

(

$27

of which is expected to be tax deductible) and other identifiable intangible assets of

$50

, primarily customer relationships and intellectual property with a weighted-average life of approximately


years. Valuations of certain acquired assets and liabilities are in-process and subject to refinement. These acquisitions complement the existing segment portfolios and create incremental growth opportunities.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase Pentair's Valves & Controls business for

$3.15 billion

, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. This business, with sales of approximately

$1.6 billion

, is a manufacturer of control, isolation and pressure relief valves and actuators, and complements the Process Management segment's final control business. The transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar year 2016 or shortly thereafter, subject to customary closing conditions and various regulatory approvals.

The Company completed

eight

acquisitions in 2015,

seven

in Process Management and

one

in Commercial & Residential Solutions, which had combined annualized sales of approximately

$115

. Total cash paid for all businesses was

$324

, net of cash acquired. The Company recognized goodwill of

$178

(

$42

of which is expected to be tax deductible) and other intangible assets of

$128

, primarily customer relationships and intellectual property with a weighted-average life of approximately


years.

In January 2015, the Company completed the sale of its mechanical power transmission solutions business to Regal Beloit Corporation for

$1.4 billion

, and recognized a pretax gain from the transaction of

$939

(

$532

after-tax,

$0.78

per share). Assets and liabilities sold were as follows: current assets,

$182

(accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets); other assets,

$374

(property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other noncurrent assets); accrued expenses,

$56

(accounts payable, other current liabilities); and other liabilities,

$41

. Proceeds from the divestiture were used for share repurchase. This business was previously reported in the Industrial Automation segment, and had partial year sales in 2015 of

$189

and related pretax earnings of

$21

. Power transmission


solutions designs and manufactures market-leading couplings, bearings, conveying components and gearing and drive components, and provides supporting services and solutions.

On September 30, 2015, the Company sold its InterMetro commercial storage business to Ali Group of Italy for

$411

in cash and recognized a pretax gain from the transaction of

$100

(

$79

after-tax,

$0.12

per share). This business had annual sales of

$288

and pretax earnings of

$42

in 2015 and was reported in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment. Assets and liabilities sold were as follows: current assets,

$62

(accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets); other assets,

$292

(property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other noncurrent assets); current liabilities,

$34

(accounts payable, other current liabilities); and other liabilities,

$9

. InterMetro is a leading manufacturer and supplier of storage and transport products in the food service, commercial products and health care industries.

In the first quarter of 2014, the Company acquired

100 percent

of Virgo Valves and Controls Limited and Enardo Holdings, both in the Process Management final control business. Virgo is a manufacturer of engineered valves and automation systems and Enardo is a manufacturer of tank and terminal safety equipment. Total cash paid for both businesses was approximately

$506

, net of cash acquired, and the Company also assumed

$76

of debt. Combined sales for Virgo and Enardo in 2014 were

$321

. Goodwill of

$323

(largely nondeductible) and identifiable intangible assets of

$178

, primarily customer relationships and patents and technology with weighted-average lives of approximately


years, were recognized from these transactions. The Company also acquired

four

other smaller businesses in 2014 for a total of approximately

$104

, net of cash acquired. Combined annual sales for these

four

businesses were approximately

$55

.

These acquisitions were complementary to the existing business portfolio.

In the second quarter of 2014, the Company acquired the remaining

44.5 percent

noncontrolling interest in Appleton Group (formally EGS Electrical Group), which is reported in Industrial Automation, for

$574

. Full ownership provides growth opportunities in the oil and gas and chemicals end markets by leveraging the Company's Process Management and international distribution channels. The transaction reduced noncontrolling interests

$101

and common stockholders' equity

$343

, and increased deferred tax assets

$130

. The transaction did not affect consolidated results of operations other than eliminating the noncontrolling interest's share of future earnings and distributions from this business. Sales for this electrical distribution business were

$542

in 2014.

In November 2013, the Company completed the divestiture of a

51 percent

controlling interest in Artesyn and received proceeds of

$264

, net of working capital adjustments. The Company retained an interest with a fair value of approximately

$60

, determined using a Level 3 option pricing model. A tax benefit of

$20

was recognized on completion of the transaction. Consolidated operating results for 2014 include sales of

$146

and a net loss of

$9

for this business through the closing date. As the Company retained a noncontrolling interest in this business, it was not classified as discontinued operations. Assets and liabilities held-for-sale at the closing date were: other current assets,

$367

(accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets); other assets,

$212

(property plant and equipment, goodwill, other noncurrent assets); and accrued expenses,

$255

(accounts payable and other liabilities). Prior to the divestiture, cash of

$376

(

$308

, after tax provided for in fiscal 2013) was repatriated from this business. In fiscal 2013, the Company initiated the purchase of

$600

of Emerson common stock in anticipation of the sale proceeds and the cash repatriation. The purchase of shares was completed in the first quarter of 2014.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company sold its connectivity solutions business for

$99

in cash, and recognized a slight gain. This business reported 2014 sales of

$63

and pretax earnings of

$3

. Connectivity solutions offered industry-leading fiber optic, radio-frequency and microwave-coaxial technologies that safeguard network reliability.

The results of operations of the acquired businesses discussed above have been included in the Company's consolidated results of operations since the respective dates of acquisition.

(4)  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The Company previously announced strategic actions to streamline its portfolio, drive growth and accelerate value creation for shareholders. These plans consisted of divesting its network power systems business through a spinoff to shareholders or sale, and also exploring strategic alternatives, including potential sale, of its power generation, motors and drives businesses. As of July 29, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its network power systems business for

$4.0 billion

in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and will retain a subordinated interest in distributions, contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold return on their initial investment. This business comprised the former Network Power segment and provides mission-critical infrastructure products and solutions and life cycle management services for vital applications in data centers,


communication networks, and commercial/industrial environments. Also, on July 30, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its power generation, motors and drives businesses for a value of

$1.2 billion

, representing cash plus assumption of certain postretirement liabilities by the buyer, subject to post-closing adjustments. These businesses were previously reported in the Industrial Automation segment, and provide low, medium and high voltage alternators and other power generation equipment and commercial and industrial motors and drives, which are used in a wide variety of manufacturing and industrial applications. Both transactions are expected to close by the end of calendar year 2016 or shortly thereafter, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The results of operations for these businesses have been reclassified into discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities are reflected as held-for-sale for all periods presented.

The financial results of the network power systems business and the power generation, motors and drives businesses reported as discontinued operations for the years ending September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were as follows:

Net earnings from discontinued operations include separation costs to execute the portfolio repositioning of

$220

and

$52

for 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs include income tax expense of

$143

in 2016 and

$42

in 2015 for repatriation of cash from these businesses, reorganization of their legal structures prior to sale, and basis differences for book and tax. Separation costs also include legal, consulting, investment banking and other expenses of

$77

and

$10

for 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, net earnings for 2016 include a loss of

$103

to write down the power generation, motors and drives businesses to the sales price less costs to sell, and lower expense of

$24

due to ceasing depreciation and amortization for the discontinued businesses held-for-sale. Earnings for 2014 include a noncash goodwill impairment charge of

$508

related to the network power systems business in Europe, which had been unable to meet its operating objectives due to a weak Western Europe economy and had an uncertain outlook.

Upon completion of the transactions, the Company preliminarily expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately

$500

and to break even after-tax, subject to finalization of several matters including separation costs to complete the transactions. In addition, the Company may incur U.S. tax costs of approximately

$200

for repatriation of estimated sales proceeds of

$1.5 billion

expected to be received offshore in connection with the transactions. The Company's decision whether to repatriate these proceeds will be determined in connection with funding needs for the acquisition of Pentair's Valves & Controls non-U.S. operations.


The aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:

The net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided (used) by investing activities for the network power systems business and the power generation, motors and drives businesses for the years ending September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were as follows:

Cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was reduced by payments of

$179

for separation costs.

(5)  OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET

Other is composed of several items, including foreign currency transaction gains and losses, bad debt expense, equity investment income and losses, litigation and other items. The increase in other for 2016 is primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency transaction impact of

$67

, partially offset by lower litigation costs of

$30

and a

$21

gain on payments received related to dumping duties collected by U.S. Customs from 2006 through 2010, but not distributed to affected domestic producers until resolution of certain legal challenges to the U.S. Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. The increase in 2015 is primarily due to higher litigation costs of

$29

and an unfavorable foreign currency transaction impact of

$15

, partially offset by a favorable comparative effect from the

$34

Artesyn equity investment loss in 2014.


(6)  RESTRUCTURING COSTS

Each year the Company incurs costs to size its businesses to levels appropriate for current economic conditions and to continually improve its cost structure and operational efficiency, deploy assets globally, and remain competitive on a worldwide basis. Costs result from numerous individual actions implemented across the Company's various operating units on an ongoing basis and can include costs for moving facilities to best-cost locations, restarting plants after relocation or geographic expansion to better serve local markets, reducing forcecount or the number of facilities, exiting certain product lines, and other costs resulting from asset deployment decisions. By category, shutdown costs include severance and benefits, stay bonuses, lease and other contract termination costs and asset write-downs. Vacant facility costs include security, maintenance, utilities and other costs. Start-up and moving costs include the costs of relocating fixed assets and employee training and relocation.

Restructuring expenses were

$96

,

$138

and

$39

, respectively, for


,


and


. Restructuring activity accelerated in 2015 to address the slowdown in global capital spending and remained elevated in 2016 due to continued weakness globally and in connection with the Company's strategic portfolio repositioning activities. The Company currently expects


restructuring expense to be approximately

$50

, including costs to complete actions initiated before the end of


and for actions anticipated to be approved and initiated during


.

The change in the liability for restructuring costs during the years ended September 30 follows:

Restructuring costs by business segment follows:

Costs incurred in


and


related to the reduction and selective repositioning of the Company’s cost structure to address global economic weakness and in connection with the portfolio repositioning through facilities and forcecount rationalization in Europe and North America, primarily in Process Management. In 2014, costs primarily related to the deployment of resources to better serve local markets and higher growth areas, and were concentrated in Process Management and Climate Technologies in Asia and Europe. In


, restructuring activities included actions to exit


production or office facilities worldwide and eliminate approximately

1,900

positions. Expenses incurred in 2015 and 2014 included actions to exit


and


facilities, and eliminate approximately

3,100

and

1,600

positions, respectively.


(7)  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

Purchases of businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method, with substantially all goodwill assigned to the reporting unit that acquires the business. Under an impairment test performed annually, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. Fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures which are estimated generally using an income approach that discounts future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions. See Note 3 for further discussion of changes in goodwill related to acquisitions and divestitures.

The change in the carrying value of goodwill by business segment follows:

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of identifiable intangible assets by major class follow:

Intangible asset amortization expense for


,


and


was

$177

,

$174

and

$167

, respectively. Based on intangible asset balances as of

September 30, 2016

, amortization expense is expected to approximate

$172

in


,

$154

in


,

$128

,

$105

in


and

$88

in


.

(8)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Hedging Activities

As of

September 30, 2016

, the notional amount of foreign currency hedge positions was approximately

$1.4 billion

, while commodity hedge contracts totaled approximately

51 million

pounds (

$103

) of copper and aluminum. All derivatives receiving deferral accounting are cash flow hedges. The majority of hedging gains and losses deferred as of

September 30, 2016

are expected to be recognized over the next

12 months

as the underlying forecasted transactions occur. Gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives reported in other deductions, net reflect hedges of balance sheet exposures that do not receive deferral accounting.


Amounts included in earnings and other comprehensive income follow:

Regardless of whether derivatives receive deferral accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or losses to be essentially offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately recognized will differ from those presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations until settlement. Derivatives receiving deferral accounting are highly effective and no amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial in all years shown.

Fair Value Measurement

The estimated fair value of long-term debt was

$4,806

and

$4,936

, respectively, as of

September 30, 2016

and


, which exceeded the carrying value by

$477

and

$356

, respectively. As of

September 30, 2016

, the fair value of commodity contracts and foreign currency contracts was reported in other current assets and accrued expenses. Valuations of derivative contract positions as of September 30 follow:

(9)  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LINES OF CREDIT

Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt are as follows:

The Company routinely issues commercial paper as a source of short-term financing. In April 2014, the Company entered into a

$3.5 billion

five-year revolving backup credit facility with various banks, which replaced a December 2010

$2.75 billion

facility. The credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowing. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate and currency denomination alternatives at the Company's option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial.


(10)  LONG-TERM DEBT

The details of long-term debt follow:

Long-term debt maturing during each of the four years after


is

$270

,

$690

,

$502

and

$300

, respectively. Total interest paid on all debt was approximately

$209

,

$196

and

$210

in


,


and


, respectively. During the year, the Company repaid

$250

of

4.75%

notes that matured in October 2015. In 2015, the Company repaid

$250

of

5.0%

notes that matured in December 2014 and

$250

of

4.125%

notes that matured in April 2015.

The Company maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.

(11)  RETIREMENT PLANS

Retirement plans expense includes the following components:

Beginning in 2016, the Company refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of pension expense for its U.S. retirement plans. The specific spot rates along the yield curve, rather than the single weighted-average rate previously used, are now applied to the projected cash flows to provide more precise measurement of these costs. This is a change in estimate which has been accounted for prospectively in the 2016


financial statements. The change reduced the 2016 service and interest cost by a total of

$38

compared with the cost measured using the weighted-average approach. The increase in net periodic pension expense in 2015 is attributable to higher service costs and amortization compared to the prior year. Net periodic pension expense includes

$12

,

$14

and

$11

and defined contribution expense includes

$34

,

$33

and

$33

, for


,


and


, respectively, related to discontinued operations. For defined contribution plans, the Company makes cash contributions based on plan requirements, which are expensed as incurred.

The Company transitioned from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans in 2016. The principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016, and current employees not meeting combined age and years of service criteria ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016. Affected employees were enrolled in an enhanced defined contribution plan. The impact of these actions had an inconsequential impact on the Company's financial statements at September 30, 2016. Over time, defined benefit plan expense will decline while defined contribution plan expense will increase, with an expectation of reduced earnings volatility.

All of the following tables include defined benefit plans related to continuing and discontinued operations.

Details of the changes in the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans follow:


Approximately

$234

of the

$1,916

of pretax losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at

September 30, 2016

will be amortized to expense in


. As of

September 30, 2016

, U.S. pension plans were underfunded by

$586

and non-U.S. plans were underfunded by

$411

. The U.S. funded status includes unfunded plans totaling

$216

and the non-U.S. status includes unfunded plans totaling

$237

.

As of the

September 30, 2016

and


measurement dates, the plans' total accumulated benefit obligation was

$5,729

and

$5,254

, respectively. Also as of the measurement dates, the total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for individual plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were

$5,951

,

$5,678

and

$4,958

, respectively, for


, and

$1,245

,

$1,139

and

$648

, respectively, for


.

Future benefit payments by U.S. plans are estimated to be

$215

in


,

$224

in


,

$233

in


,

$241

in


,

$249

in


and

$1,326

in total over the five years 2022 through 2026. Based on foreign currency exchange rates as of

September 30, 2016

, future benefit payments by non-U.S. plans are estimated to be

$41

in


,

$42

in


,

$45

in


,

$47

in


,

$51

in


and

$306

in total over the five years 2022 through 2026. The Company expects to contribute approximately

$40

to its retirement plans in


.

The weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of pension benefits follow:

The discount rate for the U.S. retirement plans was

3.50 percent

as of September 30, 2016. An actuarially developed, company-specific yield curve is used to determine the discount rate. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined by reviewing the investment returns of the plans for the past

10 years

plus longer-term historical returns of an asset mix approximating the Company's asset allocation targets, and periodically comparing these returns to expectations of investment advisors and actuaries to determine whether long-term future returns are expected to differ significantly from the past.

The Company's asset allocations at

September 30, 2016

and


, and weighted-average target allocations follow:

The primary objective for the investment of pension assets is to secure participant retirement benefits by earning a reasonable rate of return. Plan assets are invested consistent with the provisions of the prudence and diversification rules of ERISA and with a long-term investment horizon. The Company continuously monitors the value of assets by class and routinely rebalances to remain within target allocations. The strategy for equity assets is to minimize concentrations of risk by investing primarily in companies in a diversified mix of industries worldwide, while targeting neutrality in exposure to market capitalization levels, growth versus value profile, global versus regional markets, fund types and fund managers. The approach for bonds emphasizes investment-grade corporate and government debt with maturities matching a portion of the longer duration pension liabilities. The bonds strategy also includes a


high-yield element which is generally shorter in duration. For diversification, a small portion of U.S. plan assets is allocated to private equity partnerships and real asset fund investments, providing opportunities for above market returns. Leveraging techniques are not used and the use of derivatives in any fund is limited and inconsequential.

The fair values of defined benefit pension assets as of September 30, organized by asset class and by the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement,

follow:

Asset Classes

U.S. equities reflect companies domiciled in the U.S., including multinational companies. International equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S.  Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent investment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Government bonds include investment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local governments, primarily in the U.S. High-yield bonds include noninvestment-grade debt from a diverse group of developed market issuers. Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds investing in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general investment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or provide for a small minimum return guarantee.

Fair Value Hierarchy Categories

Valuations of Level 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the individual securities are traded. Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Equity securities categorized as Level 2 assets are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collective funds where the underlying securities have observable prices available from active markets. Valuation is based on the net asset value of fund units held as derived from the fair value of the underlying assets. Debt securities categorized as Level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Other Level 2 assets are valued based on a net asset value of fund units held, which is derived from either market-observed pricing for the underlying assets or broker/dealer

quotation. U.S. equity securities classified as Level 3 are fund investments in private companies. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prevailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed assets funds are Level 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund investments and insurance arrangements are Level 3.


Details of the changes in value for Level 3 assets follow:

(12)  POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

The Company sponsors unfunded postretirement benefit plans (primarily health care) for certain U.S. retirees and their dependents. The components of net postretirement benefits expense for the years ended September 30 follow:

Details of the changes in actuarial present value of accumulated postretirement benefit obligations follow:

As of

September 30, 2016

there were

$133

of deferred actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income, of which approximately

$19

will be amortized into earnings in


. The discount rates used to measure the benefit obligation as of

September 30, 2016

,


and


were

3.10 percent

,

3.80 percent

and

3.75 percent

, respectively. The health care cost trend rate used for both


and


is assumed to be

6.5 percent

initially, and declining to

5.0 percent

over the subsequent three years. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the health care cost trend rate assumption for either year would have an inconsequential impact on postretirement benefits expense and the benefit obligation. The Company estimates that future health care benefit payments will be approximately

$20

per year for


through


, and

$70

in total over the five years


through


.

(13)  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

The Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability and other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters; and any related insurance coverage. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company enters into certain indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business in which the indemnified party is held harmless and


is reimbursed for losses incurred from claims by third parties, usually up to a prespecified limit. In connection with divestitures of certain assets or businesses, the Company often provides indemnities to the buyer with respect to certain matters including, for example, environmental or unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to the disposition. Because of the uncertain nature of the indemnities, the maximum liability cannot be quantified. As such, contingent liabilities are recorded when they are both probable and reasonably estimable. Historically, payments under indemnity arrangements have been inconsequential.

At

September 30, 2016

, there were

no

known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.

(14)  INCOME TAXES

Pretax earnings from continuing operations consist of the following:

The principal components of income tax expense follow:

Reconciliations of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate follow:

Non-U.S. tax holidays reduce tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and are expected to expire over the next

two

years.


Following are changes in unrecognized tax benefits before considering recoverability of any cross-jurisdictional tax credits (federal, state and non-U.S.) and temporary differences. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not expected to change significantly within the next


months.

If none of the unrecognized tax benefits shown is ultimately paid, the tax provision and the calculation of the effective tax rate would be favorably impacted by

$48

, which is net of cross-jurisdictional tax credits and temporary differences. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. Total interest and penalties recognized were

$2

,

$(4)

and

$3

in


,


and


, respectively. As of

September 30, 2016

and


, total accrued interest and penalties were

$21

and

$20

, respectively.

The U.S. is the major jurisdiction for which the Company files income tax returns. U.S. federal tax returns are closed through 2012. The status of state and non-U.S. tax examinations varies due to the numerous legal entities and jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

The principal items that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities follow:

Current deferred tax assets, net were

$400

and

$305

as of

September 30, 2016

and


, respectively, and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, net were

$174

and

$239

. Total income taxes paid were approximately

$950

,

$1,590

and

$1,310

in


,


and


, respectively. Approximately half of the

$164

of net operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely, while the remainder expire over varying periods.


(15)  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company's stock-based compensation plans include stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Although the Company has discretion, shares distributed under these plans are issued from treasury stock.

Stock Options

The Company's stock option plans permit key officers and employees to purchase common stock at specified prices, which are equal to

100 percent

of the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Options generally vest

one-third

in each of the three years subsequent to grant and expire

10 years

from the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the number of options expected to vest. As of

September 30, 2016

,

10.9 million

options were available for grant under the plans.

Changes in shares subject to options during the year ended

September 30, 2016

follow (shares in thousands):

The weighted-average grant date fair value per option was

$9.02

,

$12.48

and

$14.83

in


,


and


, respectively. Cash received for option exercises was

$31

in


,

$36

in


and

$77

in


. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in


,


and


was

$9

,

$16

and

$61

, respectively, while the tax benefit realized by the Company from tax deductions related to option exercises was

$2

,

$10

and

$14

, respectively.

The grant date fair value of options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in valuations for


,


and


are, respectively: risk-free interest rate, based on U.S. Treasury yields,

1.9 percent

,

1.9 percent

and

2.0 percent

; dividend yield,

3.8 percent

,

3.1 percent

and

2.6 percent

; and expected volatility, based on historical volatility,

27 percent

,

28 percent

and

28 percent

. The expected life of each option awarded is seven years based on historical experience and expected future exercise patterns.

Performance Shares, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

The Company's incentive shares plans include performance shares awards which distribute the value of common stock to key management employees subject to certain operating performance conditions and other restrictions. The form of distribution is primarily shares of common stock, with a portion in cash. Compensation expense for performance shares is recognized over the service period based on the number of shares ultimately expected to be earned. Performance shares awards are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 718,

Compensation - Stock Compensation

, with compensation expense adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect the change in fair value of the awards.

As of September 30, 2016,

4,944,575

performance shares awarded primarily in 2013 were outstanding, contingent on the Company achieving its performance objectives through 2016 and the provision of additional service by employees. The objectives for these shares were met at the

86 percent

level at the end of 2016, or

4,252,335

shares. Of these,

2,552,949

shares will be distributed in early 2017 while

1,699,386

shares remain subject to employees providing one additional year of service. Additionally, the rights to receive a maximum of

2,186,150

common shares awarded in 2016, under the new performance shares program, are outstanding and contingent upon the Company achieving its performance objectives through 2018. As a result of the Company's level of achievement of its performance shares objective at the end of 2013 for performance shares awarded primarily in 2010, and employees providing an additional year of service, rights to receive

4,823,045

common shares vested and were distributed to participants in 2014 as follows:

2,782,143

issued as shares,

1,829,617

withheld for income taxes and the value of

211,285

paid in cash.

14,694

shares were canceled and not distributed.


Incentive shares plans also include restricted stock awards which involve distribution of common stock to key management employees subject to cliff vesting at the end of service periods ranging from three to ten years. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the average of the high and low market prices of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, with compensation expense recognized ratably over the applicable service period. In 2016,

235,000

shares of restricted stock vested as a result of participants fulfilling the applicable service requirements. Consequently,

139,436

shares were issued while

95,564

shares were withheld for income taxes in accordance with minimum withholding requirements. As of

September 30, 2016

, there were

1,174,500

shares of unvested restricted stock outstanding.

The total fair value of shares vested under incentive shares plans was

$11

,

$9

and

$315

, respectively, in


,


and


, of which

$4

,

$5

and

$134

was paid in cash, primarily for tax withholding. As of

September 30, 2016

,

15.4 million

shares remained available for award under incentive shares plans.

Changes in shares outstanding but not yet earned under incentive shares plans during the year ended

September 30, 2016

follow (shares in thousands):

Total compensation expense for stock options and incentive shares was

$159

,

$30

and

$143

for


,


and


, respectively, of which

$14

,

$6

and

$20

was included in discontinued operations. The increase in expense for 2016 reflects an increasing stock price in the current year compared with a decreasing price in 2015, and overlap of awards. The decrease in expense for 2015 reflects a stock option award in 2014 and no incentive stock plan overlap in 2015, and a lower stock price in 2015.  Income tax benefits recognized in the income statement for these compensation arrangements during


,


and


were

$45

,

$2

and

$39

, respectively. As of

September 30, 2016

, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested shares awarded under these plans was

$133

, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.8

years.

In addition to the employee stock option and incentive shares plans, in


the Company awarded

24,336

shares of restricted stock and

3,042

restricted stock units under the restricted stock plan for nonmanagement directors. As of

September 30, 2016

,

194,577

shares were available for issuance under this plan.

(16) COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK

At

September 30, 2016

,

48.3 million

shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the Company's stock-based compensation plans. During

12.5 million

common shares were purchased and

0.7 million

treasury shares were reissued. In


,

43.1 million

common shares were purchased and

(18)  BUSINESS SEGMENTS INFORMATION

The Company designs and manufactures products and delivers services that bring technology and engineering together to provide innovative solutions for customers in a wide range of industrial, commercial and consumer markets around the world. The business segments of the Company are organized primarily by the nature of the products and services they sell.

The

Process Management

segment provides systems and software, measurement and analytical instrumentation, valves, actuators and regulators, services and solutions and reliability consulting including digital plant architecture that allows communication of devices with centralized systems, to provide precision measurement, control, monitoring, asset optimization, and plant safety and reliability for plants that produce power or process fluids or items such as petroleum, chemicals, food and beverages, pulp and paper, pharmaceuticals and municipal water supplies. The

Industrial Automation

segment provides fluid power and control mechanisms, electrical distribution equipment, and materials joining and precision cleaning products which are used in a wide variety of manufacturing operations to provide integrated manufacturing solutions to customers. The

Climate Technologies

segment supplies compressors, temperature sensors and controls, thermostats, flow controls and remote monitoring technology and services to all areas of the climate control industry, including residential heating and cooling, commercial air conditioning, commercial and industrial refrigeration and marine controls. The

Commercial & Residential Solutions

segment provides tools for professionals and homeowners, home storage systems and appliance solutions. The principal distribution method for each segment is direct sales forces, although the Company also uses independent sales representatives and distributors. Due to its global presence, certain of the Company's international operations are subject to risks such as significant currency exchange rate fluctuations, restrictions on the movement of funds and potential nationalization of operations. See Notes 3 through 7.

The primary income measure used for assessing segment performance and making operating decisions is earnings before interest and income taxes. Intersegment selling prices approximate market prices. Accounting method differences between segment reporting and the consolidated financial statements are primarily management fees


allocated to segments based on a percentage of sales and the accounting for pension and other retirement plans. Corporate and other includes stock compensation expense, and goodwill impairment charges when applicable. Corporate assets are primarily comprised of cash and equivalents, investments and certain fixed assets. Summarized below is information about the Company's operations by business segment and by geography.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Emerson Electric Co.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Emerson Electric Co. and subsidiaries as of

September 30, 2016

and


, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

September 30, 2016

. We also have audited Emerson Electric Co.'s internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2016

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Emerson Electric Co.'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Emerson Electric Co. and subsidiaries as of

September 30, 2016

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

September 30, 2016

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Emerson Electric Co. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2016

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
