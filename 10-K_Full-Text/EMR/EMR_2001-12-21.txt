<PAGE>

RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY

Emerson's major requirements for basic raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other petroleum-based chemicals. Emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one supplier. The raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. Emerson uses various forms of energy, principally natural gas and electricity, obtained from public utilities. A majority of the plants have the capability of being converted to use alternative sources of energy.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES

The Company has a number of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises, obtained over a number of years and expiring at various times. While proprietary intellectual property is important to the Company, management believes the loss or expiration of any intellectual property rights would not materially impact the Company or any of its segments.

BACKLOG

The estimated consolidated order backlog of the Company was $2,135 million and $2,838 million at September 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Nearly all of the September 30, 2001 consolidated backlog amount is expected to be shipped within one year. The estimated backlog by business segment at September 30, 2001 and 2000, follows (dollars in millions):

COMPETITION

Emerson's businesses are highly competitive, and Emerson competes on product performance, quality, service or price across the industries and markets served. A significant element of the Company's competitive strategy is its objective to manufacture high quality products at the lowest relevant global cost. Although no single company competes directly with Emerson in all of the Company's product lines, various companies compete in one or more product lines. Some of these companies have substantially greater sales and assets than Emerson, and Emerson also competes with many smaller companies. The


<PAGE>

number of Emerson's competitors varies by product line, and management believes that Emerson has a market leadership position in many of these product lines.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Costs associated with Company-sponsored research, new product development and product improvement were $593.9 million in 2001 and 2000, and $510.3 million in 1999.

ENVIRONMENT

The Company's manufacturing locations generate waste, the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of which are subject to federal, state and/or local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.

Compliance with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment of otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon Emerson's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. It is not anticipated that Emerson will have material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during the next fiscal year.

EMPLOYEES

Emerson and its subsidiaries had an average of approximately 124,500 employees during 2001. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable. Some of the Company's employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements, but none of these is considered significant.

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

International sales were $6,189 million in 2001, $5,894 million in 2000 and $5,713 million in 1999, including U.S. exports of $1,008 million, $1,049 million and $960 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Although there are additional risks attendant to foreign operations, such as nationalization of facilities, currency fluctuations and restrictions on the movement of funds, Emerson's financial position has not been materially affected thereby to date. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 31 of the 2001 Annual Report for further information with respect to foreign operations.

Item 2. Properties

At September 30, 2001, Emerson had approximately 360 manufacturing locations worldwide, of which approximately 200 were located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America. The approximate number of manufacturing locations by business segment are: Process Control, 80; Industrial Automation, 90; Electronics and Telecommunications, 70; Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning, 60; and Appliance and Tools, 60. The majority of the locations are owned, with the remainder occupied under operating or capital leases. The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used.


<PAGE>

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Emerson is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. There are no pending legal proceedings that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's business or financial position.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the quarter ended September 30, 2001.
