          Europe
          24 percent, Asia 21 percent and other regions 23 percent.

Process
          Management Systems and Software

Emerson’s
            Process Management systems and software control plant processes by collecting
            and analyzing information from measurement devices in the plant, and
            by using
            that information to adjust valves, pumps, motors, drives and other control
            hardware in the plant for maximum product quality and process efficiency.
            Emerson’s process control systems can be extended wirelessly to support a mobile
            workforce with handheld tools/communicators, provide site-wide location
            tracking
            of people and assets, enable video monitoring and communicate with wireless
            field devices, increasing the information available to operations.


Measurement
            and Analytical Instrumentation

Measurement
            instrumentation measures the physical properties of liquids or gases
            in a
            process stream, such as pressure, temperature, level, or rate and amount
            of
            flow, and communicates this information to the control system. Measurement
            technologies provided by Emerson include Coriolis direct mass flow, magnetic
            flow, vortex flow, ultrasonic flow, differential pressure, ultralow-flow
            fluid
            measurement, temperature sensors and radar based tank gauging. Emerson
            measurement products also are used in custody transfer applications,
            such as the
            transfer of gasoline from a storage tank to a tanker truck, where precise
            metering of the amount of fluid transferred helps ensure accurate asset
            management.

Analytical
              instrumentation analyzes the chemical composition of process fluids
              and
              emissions to enhance quality and efficiency, as well as environmental
              compliance. Emerson’s analytical technologies include process gas
              chromatographs, in-situ oxygen analyzers, infrared gas and process
              fluid
              analyzers, combustion analyzers and systems, and analyzers that measure
              pH,
              conductivity and water quality.

Emerson
              also provides these same technologies with wireless communication capability.
              This allows customers to monitor processes or equipment that were previously
              not
              measurable (remote, moving/rotating) or not economical to measure due
              to the
              cost and difficulty of running wires in industrial process plants.

Valves,
              Actuators and Regulators

Control
              valves respond to commands from the control system by continuously
              and precisely
              modulating the flow of process fluids to provide maximum process efficiency
              and
              product quality. Emerson provides sliding stem valves, rotary valves,
              butterfly
              valves and related valve actuators and controllers. Emerson also provides
              a line
              of industrial and residential regulators, whose function is to reduce
              the
              pressure of fluids such as natural gas and liquid petroleum gas for
              transfer
              from high-pressure supply lines to lower pressure systems.

Digital
                Plant Architecture

Emerson’s
              PlantWeb

digital
              plant architecture combines the technologies described above with the
              advantages
              of “intelligent” plant devices (valves and measurement instruments that have
              advanced diagnostic capabilities), open communication standards (non-proprietary
              wired and wireless digital protocols allowing the plant devices and
              the control
              system to “talk” with one another) and integrated modular software, not only to
              control the process better but also to collect and analyze valuable
              information
              about plant assets and processes. This capability gives customers the
              ability to
              detect or predict changes in equipment and process performance and
              the impact
              they can have on plant operations. The PlantWeb

architecture
              provides the insight to improve plant availability and safety, and
              also
              furnishes a platform to continually improve asset management and standards
              compliance, and to reduce startup, operations and maintenance
              costs.

Industry
                Services and Solutions

Emerson’s
                array of process automation and asset optimization services can improve
                automation project implementation time and costs, increase process
                availability
                and productivity, and reduce total cost of ownership. Global industry
                centers
                offer engineering and project management services to help customers
                extract
                maximum performance and reliability from their process equipment
                and automation
                assets. These centers serve industries such as oil and gas, pulp
                and paper,
                chemical, power, food and beverage, and life sciences. They also
                assist
                customers in diagnosing equipment problems and plant
                inefficiencies.


Distribution

The
            principal worldwide distribution channel for the Process Management segment
            is a
            direct sales force, although a network of independent sales representatives,
            and
            to a lesser extent, independent distributors purchasing these products
            for
            resale are also utilized. The majority of sales in the United States
            are made
            through a direct sales force with the remainder primarily through independent
            sales representatives. In Europe and Asia, sales are almost exclusively
            made
            through a direct sales force with the remainder split evenly between
            independent
            sales representatives and distributors.

Emerson
                    utilizes various production operations and methods. The principal
                    production
                    operations are metal stamping, forming, casting, machining, welding,
                    plating,
                    heat treating, painting and assembly. In addition, Emerson uses
                    specialized
                    production operations, including automatic and semiautomatic
                    testing, automated
                    material handling and storage, ferrous and nonferrous machining
                    and special
                    furnaces for heat treating and foundry applications. Management
                    believes the
                    equipment, machinery and tooling used in these processes are
                    of modern design
                    and are well maintained.

RAW
                    MATERIALS

Emerson's
                    major requirements for basic raw materials include steel, copper,
                    cast iron,
                    electronics, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics
                    and other
                    petroleum-based chemicals. Emerson has multiple sources of supply
                    for each of
                    its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on
                    any one or a few
                    suppliers. Although recent high prices for some raw materials
                    have caused
                    pricing pressures to some of our businesses, the raw materials
                    and various
                    purchased components required for its products have generally
                    been available in
                    sufficient quantities.

PATENTS,
                    TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

The
                    Company has a number of patents, trademarks and licenses, obtained
                    over a number
                    of years and expiring at various times. While proprietary intellectual
                    property
                    is important to the Company, management believes the loss or
                    expiration of any
                    intellectual property right would not materially impact the Company
                    or any of
                    its segments.

COMPETITION

Emerson's
                    businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and
                    Emerson competes
                    on product performance, quality, service and/or price across
                    the industries and
                    markets served. A significant element of the Company's competitive
                    strategy is
                    to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality
                    products at
                    the best relevant global cost. Although no single company competes
                    directly with
                    Emerson in all of the Company's product lines, various companies
                    compete in one
                    or more product lines. Some of these companies have substantially
                    greater sales
                    and assets than Emerson, and Emerson also competes with many
                    smaller companies.
                    The number of Emerson's competitors varies by product line, and
                    management
                    believes that Emerson has a market leadership position in many
                    of these product
                    lines.

RESEARCH
                    AND DEVELOPMENT

Costs
                    associated with Company-sponsored research and development activities
                    were $458
                    million, $397 million and $356 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
                    respectively.

ENVIRONMENT

The
                    Company's manufacturing locations generate waste, the treatment,
                    storage,
                    transportation and disposal of which are subject to federal,
                    state and/or local
                    laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
                    Compliance
                    with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment
                    or
                    otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not
                    had a material
                    effect upon Emerson's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
                    position. It
                    is not anticipated that Emerson will have material capital expenditures
                    for
                    environmental control facilities during the next fiscal year.

EMPLOYEES

Emerson
                    and its subsidiaries had an average of approximately 140,700
                    employees during
                    2008. Management believes that the Company's employee relations
                    are favorable.
                    Some of the Company's employees are represented under collective
                    bargaining
                    agreements, but none of these agreements is considered significant.

DOMESTIC
                    AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

International
                    sales were $13,479 million in 2008, $11,219 million in 2007 and
                    $9,166 million
                    in 2006, including U.S. exports of $1,537 million, $1,277 million
                    and $1,127
                    million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Although there
                    are additional
                    risks attendant to foreign operations, such as possible nationalization
                    of
                    facilities, currency fluctuations and restrictions on the movement
                    of funds,
                    Emerson's financial position has not been materially affected
                    thereby to date.
                    See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of
                    the 2008 Annual
                    Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference, for further
                    information

The
                    information set forth under, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” is hereby incorporated by
                    reference.

Item
                    1A. Risk Factors

Investing
                    in our securities involves risks. We may amend or supplement
                    the risk factors
                    described below from time to time by other reports we file with
                    the SEC in the
                    future.

We
                    Operate In Businesses That Are Subject To Competitive Pressures
                    That Could
                    Affect Prices Or Demand For Our Products

Our
                    businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and
                    we compete on the
                    basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across
                    the
                    industries and markets served. A significant element of our competitive
                    strategy
                    is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high
                    quality products
                    at the best relevant global cost. Some of our competitors have
                    greater sales,
                    assets and financial resources than our Company. Competitive
                    pressures could
                    affect prices or customer demand for our products, impacting
                    our profit margins
                    and/or resulting in a loss of market share.

Our
                    Operating Results Depend In Part On Continued Successful Research,
                    Development
                    And Marketing Of New And/Or Improved Products And Services, And
                    There Can Be No
                    Assurance That We Will Continue To Successfully Introduce New
                    Products And
                    Services

The
                    success of new and improved products and services depends on
                    their initial and
                    continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected
                    by varying
                    degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer
                    demand,
                    which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened
                    life cycles and
                    increased importance of being first to market with new products
                    and services. We
                    may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development,
                    production
                    and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively
                    impact our
                    operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing
                    a return on the
                    investments required to bring new products and services to market.

We
                    Engage In Acquisitions, And May Encounter Difficulties In Integrating
                    These
                    Businesses And Therefore We May Not Realize The Anticipated Benefits
                    Of The
                    Acquisitions

We
                    are a
                    company that, from time to time, seeks to grow through strategic
                    acquisitions.
                    In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions
                    and entered into
                    joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our
                    business, and
                    may continue to do so in the future. The success of these transactions
                    will
                    depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired
                    in these
                    transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We
                    may encounter
                    difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations,
                    and in managing
                    strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree,
                    or timing, of
                    benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction.
                    Any of the
                    foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of
                    operations.

Access
                    To Funding Through The Capital Markets Is Essential To The Execution
                    Of Our
                    Business Plan And If We Are Unable To Maintain Such Access We
                    Could Experience A
                    Material Adverse Effect On Our Business And Financial Results

Our
                    ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions
                    and refinance
                    maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets
                    and sufficient
                    bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. If we are
                    unable to continue
                    to access the capital markets, we could experience a material
                    adverse effect on
                    our business and financial results.


We
                    Use A Variety Of Raw Materials And Components In Our Businesses,
                    And Significant
                    Shortages Or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs
                    And Adversely
                    Impact The Competitive Positions Of Our Products

Our
                    major
                    requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron,
                    electronics,
                    aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other
                    petroleum-based
                    chemicals. Emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of
                    its major
                    requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or
                    a few suppliers.
                    Significant shortages or price increases could affect the prices
                    our affected
                    businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive
                    position of their
                    products and services, which could adversely affect our results
                    of
                    operations.

Our
                    Operations Depend On Production Facilities Throughout The World,
                    A Majority Of
                    Which Are Located Outside The United States And Subject To Increased
                    Risks Of
                    Disrupted Production Causing Delays In Shipments And Loss Of
                    Customers And
                    Revenue

We
                    manage
                    businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority
                    of which are
                    located outside the United States. Serving a global customer
                    base requires that
                    we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on
                    market
                    opportunities and maintain our best-cost position. Our international
                    production
                    facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster,
                    labor
                    strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health
                    concerns,
                    particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped
                    to handle such
                    occurrences.

Our
                    manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible
                    to changes in laws
                    and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval
                    than our
                    domestic facilities. Any such disruption could cause delays in
                    shipments of
                    products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds
                    may not
                    adequately compensate us.

Our
                    Substantial Sales Abroad Subject Us To Economic Risk As Our Results
                    Of
                    Operations May Be Adversely Affected By Foreign Currency Fluctuations
                    And
                    Changes In Local Government Regulations And Policies

We
                    sell,
                    manufacture, engineer, and purchase products in overseas markets.
                    A significant
                    portion of our sales is outside the United States, and we expect
                    sales from non
                    - U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion
                    of our total
                    sales. International sales and operations are subject to changes
                    in local
                    government regulations and policies, including those related
                    to tariffs and
                    trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, and
                    repatriation of
                    earnings. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur
                    from time to time
                    and could affect our operating results. While we monitor our
                    exchange rate
                    exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging
                    activities, this
                    risk could adversely affect our operating results.

Downturns
                    In The End Markets That We Serve May Negatively Impact Our Segment
                    Revenues And
                    Profitability

Our
                    segment revenues, operating results and profitability have varied
                    in the past
                    and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future.
                    Profitability
                    can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that
                    we serve.
                    Future downturns in any of the markets that we serve could adversely
                    affect our
                    overall sales and operating results.

We
                    Are Subject To Litigation And Environmental Regulations That
                    Could Adversely
                    Impact Our Operating Results

We
                    are,
                    and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings
                    and claims,
                    including those involving product liability and environmental
                    matters, several
                    of which claim, or may in the future claim, significant damages.
                    Given the
                    inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance
                    that existing
                    litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material
                    adverse
                    impact. We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating

At
                    September 30, 2008, Emerson had approximately 255 manufacturing
                    locations
                    worldwide, of which approximately 165 were located outside the
                    United States,
                    primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, Canada and
                    Latin America.
                    The approximate numbers of manufacturing locations by business
                    segment are:

                    40; Climate
                    Technologies, 40; and Appliance and Tools, 40. The majority of
                    the locations are
                    owned, with the remainder occupied under operating or capital
                    leases. The
                    Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the

                    which they are used.

Fiscal
                      2009 Outlook

Fiscal
                      year 2008 was a record year and Emerson is well positioned
                      moving into an
                      uncertain 2009 recessionary environment. Reported sales are
                      forecast to be in
                      the range of $23.5 billion to $25.5 billion, or negative 5
                      percent to positive 3
                      percent compared to 2008 sales of $24.8 billion. Underlying sales growth is
                      expected to be in the range of negative 4 percent to positive
                      4 percent, which
                      excludes an estimated 5 percent unfavorable impact of foreign
                      currency
                      translation at current exchange rates, and a favorable impact
                      from completed and
                      assumed future acquisitions of approximately 4 percent. Based on this level
                      of sales, the Company forecasts 2009 earnings per share in
                      the range of $2.80 to
                      $3.20. There can be no assurance when and if future acquisitions
                      will be
                      completed, and what impact future exchange rates will have.


Non-GAAP
                      Financial Measures

To
                      supplement Emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with
                      generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management
                      uses additional
                      measures, including non-GAAP financial measures as such term
                      is defined in
                      Regulation G under the rules of the Securities and Exchange
                      Commission, to
                      clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects
                      for the
                      future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical
                      measure of a
                      company’s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that
                      exclude
                      (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from)
                      the most directly
                      comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with
                      GAAP. For
                      example, these financial measures may exclude the impact of
                      certain unique items
                      such as acquisitions, divestitures, one-time gains and losses
                      or items outside
                      of management’s control (e.g., foreign currency exchange rates). Management
                      believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide
                      investors and
                      analysts useful insight into Emerson’s financial position and
                      performance.

Underlying
                        sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures
                        during the
                        periods presented, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
                        rates, are
                        provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons
                        of sales growth by
                        excluding these unique items that impact the overall comparability.
                        Underlying
                        sales should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative
                        to net sales as
                        determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Operating
                        profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling,
                        general and
                        administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined
                        as operating
                        profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term
                        operational
                        performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely
                        monitors operating
                        profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate
                        past performance
                        and actions required to improve profitability. Operating
                        profit and operating
                        profit margin should be viewed in addition to, and not as
                        an alternative to
                        pretax earnings or profit margin as determined in accordance
                        with U.S.
                        GAAP.

Earnings,
                        earnings per share, return on equity and return on total
                        capital excluding
                        one-time gains and losses provide additional insight into
                        the underlying,
                        ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate
                        period-to-period
                        comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items.
                        Given the unique
                        nature of these items, management believes that presenting
                        earnings, earnings
                        per share, return on equity and return on total capital excluding
                        them is more
                        representative of the Company’s operational performance and may be more useful
                        for investors. However, these financial measures are not
                        intended to replace
                        earnings, earnings per share, return on equity or return
                        on total capital as
                        determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Free
                        cash
                        flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) is an
                        indicator of the
                        Company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments
                        in capital
                        assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing
                        operations.
                        Operating cash flow adds back non-cash depreciation expense
                        to earnings and
                        thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures.
                        Although

management
                        believes that free cash flow is useful to both management
                        and investors as a
                        measure of the Company’s ability to generate cash, it is not intended to replace
                        operating cash flow as determined in accordance with U.S.
                        GAAP.

Overall,
                        while Emerson believes these non-GAAP financial measures
                        are useful in
                        evaluating the Company, this information should be considered
                        as supplemental in
                        nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related
                        financial
                        information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the
                        calculation of these
                        non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation
                        of similarly titled
                        financial measures presented by other companies, and therefore
                        they may not be
                        comparable among companies.

Item
                        9A. Controls and Procedures

Emerson
                        maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures
                        which are designed to
                        ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
                        in the reports
                        filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
                        is recorded,
                        processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
                        specified in the
                        SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated
                        to management,
                        including the Company’s certifying officers, as appropriate to allow timely
                        decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on an evaluation
                        performed, the
                        Company's certifying officers have concluded that the disclosure
                        controls and
                        procedures were effective as of September 30, 2008, to provide
                        reasonable
                        assurance of the achievement of these objectives.

Notwithstanding
                        the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's
                        disclosure controls
                        and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons
                        within the Company
                        and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information
                        otherwise
                        required to be set forth in the Company's reports.

There
                        was
                        no change in the Company's internal control over financial
                        reporting during the
                        quarter ended September 30, 2008, that has materially affected,
                        or is reasonably
                        likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control
                        over financial
                        reporting.

Management’s
                        report on internal control over financial reporting, and
                        the related report of
                        the Company’s auditor, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
