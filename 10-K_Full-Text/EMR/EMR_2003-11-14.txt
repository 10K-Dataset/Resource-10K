In addition, Emerson also uses specialized production operations, including automatic and semiautomatic testing, automated material handling and storage, ferrous and nonferrous machining and special furnaces for heat treating and foundry applications. Management believes the equipment, machinery and tooling used in these processes are of modern design and are well maintained.

RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY

Emerson's major requirements for basic raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other


<PAGE>

petroleum-based chemicals. Emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one supplier. The raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. Emerson uses various forms of energy, principally natural gas and electricity, obtained from public utilities. A majority of the plants have the capability of being converted to use alternative sources of energy.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES

The Company has a number of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises, obtained over a number of years and expiring at various times. While proprietary intellectual property is important to the Company, management believes the loss or expiration of any intellectual property right would not materially impact the Company or any of its segments.

BACKLOG

The estimated consolidated order backlog of the Company was $2,072 million and $2,359 million at September 30, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Nearly all of the September 30, 2003 consolidated backlog amount is expected to be shipped within one year. The estimated backlog by business segment at September 30, 2002 and 2003, follows (dollars in millions):

COMPETITION

Emerson's businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and Emerson competes on product performance, quality, service or price across the industries and markets served. A significant element of the Company's competitive strategy is its objective to manufacture high quality products at the lowest relevant global cost. Although no single company competes directly with Emerson in all of the Company's product lines, various companies compete in one or more product lines. Some of these companies have substantially greater sales and assets than Emerson, and Emerson also competes with many smaller companies. The number of Emerson's competitors varies by product line, and management believes that Emerson has a market leadership position in many of these product lines.


<PAGE>

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Costs associated with Company-sponsored research, new product development and product improvement were $594 million, $530 million and $514 million in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

ENVIRONMENT

The Company's manufacturing locations generate waste, the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of which are subject to federal, state and/or local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon Emerson's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. It is not anticipated that Emerson will have material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during the next fiscal year.

EMPLOYEES

Emerson and its subsidiaries had an average of approximately 106,700 employees during 2003. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable. Some of the Company's employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements, but none of these agreements is considered significant.

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

International sales were $6,189 million in 2001, $5,751 million in 2002 and

$6,312 million in 2003, including U.S. exports of $1,008 million, $946 million and $893 million in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Although there are additional risks attendant to foreign operations, such as possible nationalization of facilities, currency fluctuations and restrictions on the movement of funds, Emerson's financial position has not been materially affected thereby to date. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2003 Annual Report for further information with respect to foreign operations.

INTERNET ACCESS

Emerson's Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge through Emerson's Web site on the Internet as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 2. Properties

At September 30, 2003, Emerson had approximately 290 manufacturing locations worldwide, of which approximately 165 were located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, Canada and Latin America. The approximate number of manufacturing locations by business segment are: Process Control, 55; Industrial Automation, 80; Electronics and Telecommunications, 45; Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning, 50;


<PAGE>

and Appliance and Tools, 60. The majority of the locations are owned, with the remainder occupied under operating or capital leases. The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used.

Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

The information regarding the market for the Company's common stock, quarterly market price ranges and dividend payments set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2003 Annual Report is hereby incorporated by reference. There were approximately 31,800 stockholders at September 30, 2003.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data

Years ended September 30

(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)

The operating results of Dura-Line have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all years presented in the table above. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2003 Annual Report for information regarding the Company's acquisition and divestiture activities.

(a)

Fiscal 2001 includes a charge of $260 million ($0.61 per share) of which $248 million ($0.58 per share) was reported in continuing operations. See

Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2003 Annual Report for additional information.

(b)

Fiscal 2002 earnings and per share amounts are before a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $938 million ($2.24 per basic share, or $2.23 per diluted share). See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2003 Annual Report for additional information.


<PAGE>

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations

Narrative discussion appearing under "Results of Operations", "Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity" and "Critical Accounting Policies" and the "Safe Harbor Statement" in the 2003 Annual Report are hereby incorporated by reference.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement Emerson's financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management uses additional measures to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. These measures may exclude, for example, the impact of unique items (acquisitions, divestitures, one-time gains and losses) or items outside of management's control (foreign currency exchange rates).

Underlying sales (which exclude the impact of acquisitions and         divestitures during the periods presented, and fluctuations in         foreign currency exchange rates) are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth excluding these unique items.

Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) is indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability.

Earnings per share excluding gains from divestitures provides additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company which facilitates period-to-period comparisons excluding the earnings impact of one-time gains from strategic portfolio decisions.

Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) is an indicator of the Company's cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. Operating cash flow adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Narrative discussion appearing under "Financial Instruments" in the 2003 Annual Report is hereby incorporated by reference.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and the report thereon of KPMG LLP in the 2003 Annual Report are hereby incorporated by reference.


<PAGE>

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and

Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Emerson maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC's rules and forms. Based on an evaluation performed, the Company's certifying officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2003, to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of these objectives.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company's reports.

There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2003, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
