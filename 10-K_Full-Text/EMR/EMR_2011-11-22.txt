In 2011, sales by geographic destination for this segment were United States and Canada 38 percent, Asia 24 percent, Europe 22 percent, Latin America 7 percent, and Middle East/Africa 9 percent.


Process Management Systems and Software

Process Management systems and software control plant processes by collecting and analyzing information from measurement devices in the plant, and then use that information to adjust valves, pumps, motors, drives and other control hardware for maximum product quality and process efficiency. Software capabilities also include upstream oil and gas reservoir simulation and modeling for production optimization. Emerson’s process control systems can be extended wirelessly to support a mobile workforce with handheld tools/communicators, provide site-wide location tracking of people and assets, and enable video monitoring and communication with wireless field devices, thereby increasing the information available to operators.

Measurement and Analytical Instrumentation

Measurement instrumentation measures the physical properties of liquids or gases in a process stream, such as pressure, temperature, level, or rate and amount of flow, and communicates this information to a control system. Measurement technologies provided by Emerson include Coriolis direct mass flow, magnetic flow, vortex flow, ultrasonic flow, differential pressure, ultralow-flow fluid measurement, temperature sensors and radar-based tank gauging. Emerson measurement products are also often used in custody transfer applications, such as the transfer of gasoline from a storage tank to a tanker truck, where precise metering of the amount of fluid transferred helps ensure accurate asset management. Complementary products include onshore and subsea multi-phase meters, wetgas meters, downhole gauges and corrosion/erosion instruments.

Analytical instrumentation analyzes the chemical composition of process fluids and emissions to enhance quality and efficiency, as well as environmental compliance. Emerson’s analytical technologies include process gas chromatographs, in-situ oxygen analyzers, infrared gas and process fluid analyzers, combustion analyzers and systems, and analyzers that measure pH, conductivity and water quality.

The Company also provides these same technologies with wireless communication capability, allowing customers to monitor processes or equipment that were previously not measurable (remote, moving/rotating) or not economical to measure due to the cost and difficulty of running wires in industrial process plants.

Valves, Actuators and Regulators

Control valves respond to commands from a control system to continuously and precisely modulate the flow of process fluids to provide maximum process efficiency and product quality. Emerson provides sliding stem valves, rotary valves, butterfly valves and related valve actuators and controllers. Emerson also provides a line of industrial and residential regulators, whose function is to reduce the pressure of fluids such as liquid natural gas and liquid petroleum gas for transfer from high-pressure supply lines to lower pressure systems.

PlantWeb

®

Digital Plant Architecture

PlantWeb

digital plant architecture combines the technologies described above with the advantages of “intelligent” plant devices (valves and measurement instruments that have advanced diagnostic capabilities), open communication standards (non-proprietary wired and wireless digital protocols allowing the plant devices and the control system to “talk” with one another) and integrated modular software, not only to better control the process but also to collect and analyze valuable information about plant assets and processes. This capability gives customers the ability to detect or predict changes in equipment and process performance and the associated impact on plant operations. PlantWeb

architecture provides the insight to improve plant availability and safety, and also furnishes a platform to continually improve asset management and standards compliance, and to reduce startup, operations and maintenance costs.

A significant element of the Company's competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the best relevant global cost. Although no single company competes directly with Emerson in all of the Company's product lines, various companies compete in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line. Some competitors have substantially greater sales,


assets and financial resources than Emerson and the Company also competes with many smaller companies. Management believes Emerson has a market leadership position in many of its product lines.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Costs associated with Company-sponsored research and development activities were $555 million, $473 million and $460 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

ENVIRONMENT

The Company's manufacturing locations generate waste, the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of which are subject to federal, state, foreign and/or local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon Emerson's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. The Company does not anticipate having material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during the next fiscal year.

EMPLOYEES

Emerson and its subsidiaries had an average of approximately 133,200 employees during 2011. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable. Some of the Company's employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements, but none of these agreements is considered significant. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2011 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference, for further information.

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

International sales were $14,322 million in 2011, $11,938 million in 2010 and $11,416 million in 2009, including U.S. exports of $1,520 million, $1,317 million and $1,211 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Although there are additional risks attendant to foreign operations, such as possible nationalization of facilities, currency fluctuations and restrictions on the movement of funds, Emerson's financial position has not been materially affected thereby to date. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2011 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference, for further information with respect to foreign operations.

INTERNET ACCESS

Emerson's Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge through the Company’s website on the Internet as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They may be accessed as follows: www.Emerson.com, Investor Relations, SEC Filings. Information on Emerson’s website does not constitute part of this Form 10-K.

The information set forth under, “Item 1A.  Risk Factors” is hereby incorporated by reference.


Item 1A.  Risk Factors

Investing in our securities involves risks. We may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future.

We Operate in Businesses That Are Subject to Competitive Pressures That Could Affect Prices or Demand for Our Products

Our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the best relevant global cost. Various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line. Some of our competitors have substantially greater sales, assets and financial resources than our Company and we also compete with many smaller companies. Competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products, impacting our sales or profit margins, and/or resulting in a loss of market share.

Our Operating Results Depend in Part on Continued Successful Research, Development and Marketing of New and/or Improved Products and Services, and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Successfully Introduce New Products and Services

The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.

We Engage in Acquisitions, and May Encounter Difficulties in Integrating These Businesses and Therefore We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Acquisitions

We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions. In 2011 and in past years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business, and may continue to do so in the future (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2011 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference). The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Access to Funding Through the Capital Markets Is Essential to the Execution of Our Business Plan and if We Are Unable to Maintain Such Access We Could Experience a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Financial Results

Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. Volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments, or affect the Company’s ability to access those markets. If we are unable to continue to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. If our customers, suppliers and financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the Company, our business could be adversely impacted.


We Use a Variety of Raw Materials and Components in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products

Our major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum, brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other petroleum-based chemicals. Emerson seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events. Significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.

Our Operations Depend on Production Facilities Throughout the World, a Majority of Which Are Located Outside the United States and Subject to Increased Risks of Disrupted Production Causing Delays in Shipments and Loss of Customers and Revenue

We manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States, and also source certain materials internationally. Emerging market sales now represent over one-third of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our best-cost position. Our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strife, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences.

Our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities. Any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.

Our Substantial Sales Abroad Subject Us to Economic Risk as Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Changes in Local Government Regulations and Policies

We sell, manufacture, engineer and purchase products in overseas markets. A significant portion of our sales is outside the United States, and we expect sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. International sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings, which could adversely affect our results. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.

Recessions, Adverse Market Conditions or Downturns in the End Markets We Serve May Negatively Impact Segment Revenues and Operating Results

Segment revenues, operating results and cash flows have varied in the past and may be exposed to significant volatility from quarter to quarter in the future due to changes in general economic conditions, recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve. These changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results and cash flows, which in turn could trigger impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets due to the fair value of such assets falling below the Company’s carrying value. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive rationalization actions and therefore incur higher rationalization expense during such periods. If our rationalization actions are not sufficiently effective or if we must incur rationalization costs beyond what we anticipate, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results.


We Are Subject to Litigation and Environmental Regulations That Could Adversely Impact Our Operating Results

We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability and environmental matters, several of which claim, or may in the future claim, significant damages. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Information appearing under “Results of Operations,” “Business Segments,” “Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity,” “Critical Accounting Policies,” and the "Safe Harbor Statement" in the 2011 Annual Report are hereby incorporated by reference.

Fiscal 2012 Outlook

The Company achieved strong sales and earnings results in 2011 and is well positioned moving into 2012, despite a weakening trend in business conditions. Underlying sales for fiscal year 2012 are expected to increase in the range of 5 percent to 7 percent, which excludes an estimated 1 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Net sales for the year are forecast to be in the range of positive 4 percent to 6 percent compared with 2011 sales of $24.2 billion. The Company also expects operating profit margin of approximately 18 percent (excluding approximately 2.5 percent for other deductions, net and interest) and pretax margin of approximately 15.5 percent. Earnings per share growth is expected in the range of 8 percent to 12 percent.

Process Management sources electrical and electronic components for some products from areas in Thailand that have suffered significant flood damage. The Company is implementing contingency plans and working with suppliers and customers to minimize the impact of supply disruptions. These disruptions will have a near-term impact, but do not affect the fiscal year 2012 guidance announced previously and repeated above.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement Emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” as such term is defined in Regulation G under the rules of the SEC, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions, divestitures, gains and losses, or items outside of management’s control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into Emerson’s financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.

Underlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure:

net sales

).

Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability (U.S. GAAP measures:

pretax earnings or pretax profit margin

).


Earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items. Given the nature of these items, management believes that presenting earnings, earnings per share, return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the Company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors (U.S. GAAP measures:

earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity, return on total capital

).

Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) is an indicator of the Company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. The determination of operating cash flow adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the Company’s ability to generate cash (U.S. GAAP measure:

operating cash flow

).

Emerson maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures which is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s certifying officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on an evaluation performed, the Company's certifying officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2011 to provide reasonable assurance of achieving these objectives.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company's reports.There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2011, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, and the related report of the Company’s auditor, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, appearing in the 2011 Annual Report are hereby incorporated by reference.
