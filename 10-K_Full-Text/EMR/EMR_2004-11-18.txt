COMPETITION

Emerson’s businesses operate in markets that are highly
 competitive, and Emerson competes on product performance, quality, service or price across the industries
 and markets served. A significant element of the Company’s competitive strategy is to deliver solutions
 to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the lowest relevant global cost. Although
 no single company competes directly with Emerson in all of the Company’s product lines, various companies
 compete in one or more product lines. Some of these companies have substantially greater sales and assets
 than Emerson, and Emerson also competes with many smaller companies. The number of Emerson’s competitors
 varies by product line, and management believes that Emerson has a market leadership position in many
 of these product lines.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Costs associated with Company-sponsored research, new
 product development and product improvement were $474 million, $464 million and $486 million in 2002,
 2003 and 2004, respectively.

ENVIRONMENT

The Company’s manufacturing locations generate waste,
 the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of which are subject to federal, state and/or local
 laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with laws regulating
 the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment
 has not had a material effect upon Emerson’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 It is not anticipated that Emerson will have material capital expenditures for environmental control
 facilities during the next fiscal year.

EMPLOYEES

Emerson and its subsidiaries had an average of approximately
 107,800 employees during 2004. Management believes that the Company’s employee relations are favorable.
 Some of the Company’s employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements, but none of
 these agreements is considered significant.

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

International sales were $5,751 million in 2002, $6,312
 million in 2003 and $7,353 million in 2004, including U.S. exports of $946 million, $893 million and
 $939 million in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Although there are additional risks attendant to
 foreign operations, such as possible nationalization of facilities, currency fluctuations and restrictions
 on the movement of funds, Emerson’s financial position has not been materially affected thereby to date.
 See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2004 Annual Report for further information
 with respect to foreign operations.

INTERNET ACCESS

Emerson’s Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and all amendments to
 those reports are available without charge through Emerson’s Web site on the Internet as soon as reasonably
 practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 They may be accessed as follows: www.gotoemerson.com, Investor Relations, SEC Filings.

RISK FACTORS

Investing in our securities involves risks. We may amend
 or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC
 in the future.

We Operate In Businesses That Are Subject To Competitive
 Pressures That Could Affect Prices Or Demand For Our Products

Our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive,
 and we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries
 and markets served. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our
 customers by manufacturing high quality products at the lowest relevant global cost. Some of our competitors
 have greater sales, assets and financial resources than our Company. Competitive pressures could affect
 prices or customer demand for our products, impacting our profit margins and/or resulting in a loss
 of market share.


Our Operating Results Depend In Part On Continued Successful Research, Development And Marketing Of New And/Or Improved Products And Services, And There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue To Successfully Introduce New Products And Services

The success of new and improved products and services
 depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected by varying
 degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable
 product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new
 products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production
 and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and
 prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and
 services to market.

We Engage In Acquisitions, And May Encounter Difficulties
 In Integrating These Businesses And Therefore We May Not Realize The Anticipated Benefits Of The Acquisitions

We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to grow
 through strategic acquisitions. In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and entered
 into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business, and may continue to do
 so in the future. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and
 personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter
 difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, and in managing strategic investments.
 Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipated when we first enter
 into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Access To Funding Through The Capital Markets Is Essential
 To The Execution Of Our Business Plan And If We Are Unable To Maintain Such Access We Could Experience
 A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business And Financial Results

Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic
 acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient
 bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. If we are unable to continue to access the capital
 markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

We Use A Variety Of Raw Materials And Components In
 Our Businesses, And Significant Shortages Or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs And
 Adversely Impact The Competitive Positions Of Our Products

Our major requirements for raw materials include steel,
 copper, cast iron, electronics, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other petroleum
 based chemicals. Emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not
 significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers. Significant shortages or price increases could
 affect the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position
 of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our Operations Depend On Production Facilities Throughout
 The World, A Majority Of Which Are Located Outside The United States And Subject To Increased Risks
 Of Disrupted Production Causing Delays In Shipments And Loss Of Customers And Revenue

We manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide,
 a majority of which are located outside the United States. Serving a global customer base requires that
 we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our
 best-cost position. Our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural
 disaster, labor strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns, particularly
 in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences. Our manufacturing facilities
 abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and
 political upheaval than our domestic facilities. Any such disruption could cause delays in shipments
 of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate
 us.


Our Substantial Sales Abroad Subject Us To Economic
 Risk As Our Results Of Operations May Be Adversely Affected By Foreign Currency Fluctuations And Changes
 In Local Government Regulations And Policies

We sell, manufacture, engineer, and purchase products
 in overseas markets. A significant portion of our sales is outside the United States, and we expect
 sales from non - U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. International
 sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including
 those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, and repatriation
 of earnings. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect our
 operating results. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure
 through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.

Downturns In The End Markets That We Serve May Negatively
 Impact Our Segment Revenues And Profitability

Our segment revenues, operating results and profitability
 have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. Profitability
 can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that we serve. Future downturns in any of
 the markets that we serve could adversely affect our overall sales and operating results. For example,
 we experienced a significant decline in our Network Power segment operating results in 2001 and 2002
 as a result of extremely difficult market conditions.

We Are Subject To Litigation And Environmental Regulations
 That Could Adversely Impact Our Operating Results

We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number
 of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability and environmental matters,
 several of which claim significant damages. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer

 2004 Annual Report for additional information.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Information appearing under "Overview", “Results of
 Operations”, “Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity” and “Critical Accounting Policies”
 and the “Safe Harbor Statement” in the 2004 Annual Report are hereby incorporated by reference.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement Emerson’s financial information presented
 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management uses additional measures
 to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. These measures
 may exclude, for example, the impact of unique items (acquisitions, divestitures, one-time gains and
 losses) or items outside of management’s control (foreign currency exchange rates).

Underlying sales (which exclude the impact of acquisitions
 and divestitures during the periods presented, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates)
 are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth excluding these unique
 items.

Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of
 sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating
 profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability.
 Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate
 past performance and actions required to improve profitability.


Earnings per share excluding gains from divestitures
 provides additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company which
 facilitates period-to-period comparisons excluding the earnings impact of one-time gains from strategic
 portfolio decisions.

Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures)
 is an indicator of the Company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital
 assets necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. Operating cash flow adds back non-cash
 depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Information appearing under “Financial Instruments”
 in the 2004 Annual Report is hereby incorporated by reference.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The consolidated financial statements of the Company
 and its subsidiaries and the report thereon of KPMG LLP in the 2004 Annual Report are hereby incorporated
 by reference.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Emerson maintains a system of disclosure controls and
 procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
 the reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified under the SEC’s rules and forms. Based on an evaluation performed,
 the Company’s certifying officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective
 as of September 30, 2004, to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of these objectives.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance
 that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons
 within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required
 to be set forth in the Company’s reports.

There was no change in the Company’s internal control
 over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2004, that has materially affected,
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Other Information

None.
