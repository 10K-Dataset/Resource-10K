 in these processes are of modern design and are well maintained.







 

 RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY
 ------------------------

 Emerson's major requirements for basic raw materials include steel, copper,
 cast iron, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other
 petroleum-based chemicals.  Emerson has multiple sources of supply for each
 of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one
 supplier.  The raw materials and various purchased components required for
 its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities.
 Emerson uses various forms of energy, principally natural gas and electricity,
 obtained from public utilities.  A majority of the plants have the capability
 of being converted to use alternative sources of energy.

 PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES
 --------------------------------------------

 The Company has a number of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises, none
 of which is considered material to any segment of its consolidated operations.

 BACKLOG
 -------

 The estimated consolidated order backlog of the Company was $2,838 million
 and $2,160 million at September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Nearly all
 of the September 30, 2000 consolidated backlog amount is expected to be
 shipped within one year.  The estimated backlog by business segment at
 September 30, 2000 and 1999, follows (dollars in millions):

                                                 2000          1999
                                               -------       -------
     Process Control                           $   638           567
     Industrial Automation                         444           461
     Electronics and Telecommunications          1,105           412
     Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning     314           333
     Appliance and Tools                           337           387
                                               -------       -------
          Consolidated Order Backlog           $ 2,838         2,160
                                               =======       =======

 COMPETITION
 -----------

 Emerson's businesses are highly competitive, and Emerson competes on product
 performance, quality, service or price across the industries and markets
 served.  A significant element of the Company's competitive strategy is its
 objective to manufacture high quality products at the lowest relevant global
 cost.  Although no single company competes directly with Emerson in all of the
 Company's product lines, various companies compete in one or more product
 lines.  Some of these companies have substantially greater sales and assets
 than Emerson, and Emerson also competes with many smaller companies.  The
 number of Emerson's competitors varies by product line, and management
 believes that Emerson has a market leadership position in many of these
 product lines.




 

 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 ------------------------

 Costs associated with Company-sponsored research, new product development
 and product improvement were $593.9 million in 2000, $510.3 million in 1999
 and $491.3 million in 1998.

 ENVIRONMENT
 -----------

 The Company's manufacturing locations generate waste, the treatment, storage,
 transportation and disposal of which are subject to federal, state and/or
 local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
 Compliance with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the
 environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not
 had a material effect upon Emerson's capital expenditures, earnings or
 competitive position.  It is not anticipated that Emerson will have material
 capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during the next
 fiscal year.

 EMPLOYEES
 ---------

 Emerson and its subsidiaries had an average of approximately 123,400 employees
 during 2000.  Management believes that the Company's employee relations are
 favorable.  Some of the Company's employees are represented under collective
 bargaining agreements, but none of these is considered significant.

 DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 -------------------------------

 International sales were $5,894 million in 2000, $5,713 million in 1999 and
 $5,345 million in 1998, including U.S. exports of $1,049 million, $960 million
 and $968 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Although there are
 additional risks attendant to foreign operations, such as nationalization of
 facilities, currency fluctuations and restrictions on the movement of funds,
 Emerson's financial position has not been materially affected thereby to date.
 See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 45 of the
 2000 Annual Report for further information with respect to foreign operations.

 Item 2.  Properties
 -------------------

 At September 30, 2000, Emerson had approximately 380 manufacturing locations
 worldwide, of which approximately 210 were located outside the United States,
 primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin
 America.  The approximate number of manufacturing locations by business
 segment are: Process Control, 90; Industrial Automation, 100; Electronics and
 Telecommunications, 70; Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning, 60; and
 Appliance and Tools, 60.  The majority of the locations are owned, with
 the remainder occupied under operating or capital leases.  The Company
 considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which
 they are used.




 

 Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
 --------------------------

 Emerson is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings, several of which
 claim substantial amounts of damages.  There are no pending legal proceedings
 that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's
 business or financial position.

 Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 ------------------------------------------------------------

 There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
 quarter ended September 30, 2000.

             -------------------------------------------
