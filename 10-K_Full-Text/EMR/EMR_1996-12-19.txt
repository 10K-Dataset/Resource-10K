                                      PART I
 Item 1.  Business
 -----------------

 Emerson was incorporated in Missouri in 1890.  Originally engaged in
 the manufacture and sale of electric motors and fans, Emerson's product
 lines were subsequently expanded through internal growth and acquisitions.
 Emerson is now engaged principally in the worldwide design, manufacture
 and sale of a broad range of electrical, electromechanical and electronic
 products and systems.

        ------------------------------------------------------

 The products manufactured by the Company are classified into the
 following industry segments: Commercial and Industrial Components and
 Systems; and Appliance and Construction-Related Components.  Net sales,
 income before income taxes and accounting changes and total assets
 attributable to each industry segment for the three years ended
 September 30, 1996 are set forth in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated
 Financial Statements on page 39 of the 1996 Annual Report, which note is
 hereby incorporated by reference. Information with respect to acquisition
 and divestiture activities by Emerson is set forth in Note 2 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements on page 33 of the 1996 Annual Report,
 which note is hereby incorporated by reference.

          COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS
          ------------------------------------------------

 The Commercial and Industrial segment includes process control
 instrumentation, valves and systems; industrial motors and drives;
 industrial machinery, equipment and components; and electronic products.

             ---------------------------------------------

 The Appliance and Construction-Related segment consists of fractional motors
 and appliance components; heating, ventilating and air conditioning
 components; and tools. This segment includes components sold to distributors
 and original equipment manufacturers for inclusion in end-products and systems
 (ultimately sold through commercial and residential building construction
 channels); and construction-related products which retain their identity and
 are sold through distributors to consumers and the professional trades.









 Emerson manufactures and sells a variety of components and systems for
 refrigeration and comfort control applications, including hermetic and semi-
 hermetic compressors; hermetic motors and terminals for hermetically sealed

 adjustable wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers and chisels.

 PRODUCTION
 ----------

 Emerson utilizes various production operations and methods.  The principal
 production operations are metal stamping, forming, casting, machining,
 welding, plating, heat treating, painting and assembly.  In addition,
 Emerson also uses specialized production operations, including automatic
 and semiautomatic testing, automated material handling and storage, ferrous
 and nonferrous machining and special furnaces for heat treating and foundry
 applications.  Management believes the equipment, machinery and tooling used
 in these processes are of modern design and well maintained.

 RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY
 ------------------------

 Emerson's major requirements for basic raw materials include steel, copper,
 cast iron, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other
 petroleum-based chemicals.  Emerson has multiple sources of supply for each
 of its material requirements.  The raw materials and various purchased
 components required for its products have generally been available in
 sufficient quantities.









 Emerson uses various forms of energy, principally natural gas and electricity,
 obtained from public utilities.  A majority of the plants have the capability
 of being converted to use alternative sources of energy.

 PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES
 --------------------------------------------

 The Company has a number of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises, none
 of which is considered material to any segment of its consolidated operations.

 BACKLOG
 -------

 The estimated consolidated order backlog of the Company was $1,810 million
 and $1,815 million at September 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Nearly all
 of the September 30, 1996 consolidated backlog amount is expected to be
 shipped within one year.  The estimated backlog by industry segment at
 September 30, 1996 and 1995 follows (dollars in millions):

                                                 1996          1995

     Commercial and Industrial                 $ 1,191         1,215
     Appliance and Construction-Related            619           600
                                               -------       -------
          Consolidated Order Backlog           $ 1,810         1,815
                                               =======       =======

 COMPETITION
 -----------

 Emerson's businesses are highly competitive and the methods of competition
 vary across the industry segments served.  Although no single company
 competes directly with Emerson in all of its product lines, various
 companies compete in one or more product lines.  Some of these companies
 have substantially greater sales and assets than Emerson.  In addition,
 Emerson competes with many smaller companies.

 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 ------------------------

 Costs associated with Company-sponsored research, new product development
 and product improvement were $398.7 million in 1996, $354.2 million in 1995
 and $298.2 million in 1994.

 ENVIRONMENT
 -----------

 The Company's manufacturing locations generate waste, the treatment, storage,
 transportation and disposal of which are subject to federal, state and local
 laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
 Compliance with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the
 environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not
 had a material effect upon Emerson's capital expenditures, earnings or
 competitive position.  It is not anticipated that Emerson will have material
 capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during the next
 fiscal year.


 
 EMPLOYEES
 ---------

 Emerson and its subsidiaries had an average of approximately 86,400 employees
 during 1996.

 DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 -------------------------------

 International sales were $4,867 million in 1996, $4,386 million in 1995 and
 $3,243 million in 1994, including U.S. exports of $885 million, $768 million
 and $589 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Although there are
 additional risks attendant to foreign operations, such as nationalization of
 facilities, currency fluctuations and restrictions on the movement of funds,
 Emerson's financial position has not been materially affected thereby to date.
 See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 39 of the
 1996 Annual Report for further information with respect to foreign operations.

 Item 2.  Properties
 -------------------

 At September 30, 1996, Emerson had approximately 325 manufacturing locations
 worldwide, of which approximately 170 were located outside the United States,
 primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin
 America.  Approximately 200 locations are occupied by the Commercial and
 Industrial segment, and approximately 125 are occupied by the Appliance and
 Construction-Related segment.  The majority of the locations are owned or
 occupied under capital lease obligations with the remainder occupied under
 operating leases.  The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate
 for the purposes for which they are used.

 Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
 --------------------------

 Emerson is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings, several of which
 claim substantial amounts of damages.  There are no pending legal proceedings
 that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's
 business or financial position.

 Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 ------------------------------------------------------------

 There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
 quarter ended September 30, 1996.

             -------------------------------------------
