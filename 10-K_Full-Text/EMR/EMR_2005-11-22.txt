PROCESS MANAGEMENT

The Process
Management segment offers customers product technology as well as engineering and project management services for precision control, monitoring and asset optimization of plants that produce power or that process or treat such items as oil, natural
gas and petrochemicals; food and beverages; pulp and paper; pharmaceuticals; and municipal water supplies. This array of products and services helps customers optimize their process plant capabilities in the areas of plant safety and reliability,
and product quality and output. In 2005, sales by geographic destination for this segment were United States 35 percent, Europe 26 percent, Asia 19 percent and other regions 20 percent.


Process Management Systems and Software

Emerson’s Process Management systems and software control plant processes by collecting
and analyzing information from measurement devices in the plant, and by using that information to adjust valves, pumps, motors, drives and other control hardware in the plant for maximum product quality and process efficiency.

Measurement and Analytical Instrumentation

Measurement instrumentation measures the physical properties of liquids or gases in a
process stream, such as pressure, temperature, level, or rate and amount of flow, and communicates this information to the control system. Measurement technologies provided by Emerson include Coriolis direct mass flow, magnetic flow, differential
pressure, ultralow-flow fluid measurement, temperature sensors and radar based tank gauging. Emerson measurement products also are used in custody transfer applications, such as the transfer of gasoline from a storage tank to a tanker truck, where
precise metering of the amount of fluid transferred helps ensure accurate asset management.

Analytical instrumentation analyzes the chemical composition of process fluids and emissions to enhance quality and efficiency, as well as environmental compliance. Emerson’s analytical technologies include
process gas chromatographs, in-situ oxygen analyzers, infrared gas and process fluid analyzers, combustion analyzers and systems, and analyzers that measure pH, conductivity and water quality.

Valves, Actuators and Regulators

Control valves respond to commands from the control system by continuously and precisely
modulating the flow of process fluids to provide maximum process efficiency and product quality. Emerson provides sliding stem valves, rotary valves, butterfly valves and related valve actuators and controllers. Emerson also provides a line of
industrial and residential regulators, whose function is to reduce the pressure of fluids such as natural gas and liquid petroleum gas for transfer from high-pressure supply lines to lower pressure systems.

PlantWeb

®

Digital Plant Architecture

Emerson’s PlantWeb digital plant architecture combines the technologies described above with the advantages of “intelligent” plant devices (valves and
measurement instruments that have advanced diagnostic capabilities), open communication standards (non-proprietary digital protocols allowing the plant devices and the control system to “talk” with one another) and integrated modular
software, not only to control the process better but also to collect and analyze valuable information about plant assets and processes. This capability gives customers the ability to detect or predict changes in equipment and process performance and
the impact they can have on plant operations. The PlantWeb architecture provides the insight to improve plant availability and safety. PlantWeb also furnishes a platform to continually improve asset management and standards compliance, and to reduce
startup, operations and maintenance costs.

Investor Relations, SEC Filings.

RISK FACTORS

Investing in our securities involves risks. We may amend or supplement the risk factors
described below from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future.

We Operate In Businesses That Are Subject To Competitive Pressures That Could Affect Prices Or Demand For Our Products

Our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and
markets served. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the lowest relevant global cost. Some of our competitors have greater sales, assets and financial
resources than our Company. Competitive pressures could affect prices or customer demand for our products, impacting our profit margins and/or resulting in a loss of market share.


Our Operating Results Depend In Part On Continued Successful Research, Development And Marketing Of New And/Or Improved
Products And Services, And There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue To Successfully Introduce New Products And Services

The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected by varying degrees
of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience
difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring
new products and services to market.

We Engage In Acquisitions, And May
Encounter Difficulties In Integrating These Businesses And Therefore We May Not Realize The Anticipated Benefits Of The Acquisitions

We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions. In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into
joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business, and may continue to do so in the future. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to
cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we
first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Access To Funding Through The Capital Markets Is Essential To The Execution Of Our Business Plan And If We Are Unable To Maintain Such Access We Could Experience A
Material Adverse Effect On Our Business And Financial Results

Our ability to
invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. If we are unable to continue to access the
capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

We Use A Variety Of Raw Materials And Components In Our Businesses, And Significant Shortages Or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs And Adversely Impact The Competitive Positions Of Our Products

Our major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron,
electronics, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other petroleum based chemicals. Emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers.
Significant shortages or price increases could affect the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our Operations Depend On Production Facilities Throughout The World, A Majority Of Which
Are Located Outside The United States And Subject To Increased Risks Of Disrupted Production Causing Delays In Shipments And Loss Of Customers And Revenue

We manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States. Serving a global customer base requires that we
place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our best-cost position. Our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strike, war, political
unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences.


Our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and
economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities. Any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.

Our Substantial Sales Abroad Subject Us To Economic Risk As Our Results Of Operations May Be
Adversely Affected By Foreign Currency Fluctuations And Changes In Local Government Regulations And Policies

We sell, manufacture, engineer, and purchase products in overseas markets. A significant portion of our sales is outside the United States, and we expect sales from non - U.S. markets to continue to represent a
significant portion of our total sales. International sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, and
repatriation of earnings. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect our operating results. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities, this
risk could adversely affect our operating results.

Downturns In The End
Markets That We Serve May Negatively Impact Our Segment Revenues And Profitability

Our segment revenues, operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. Profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that we serve.
Future downturns in any of the markets that we serve could adversely affect our overall sales and operating results.

We Are Subject To Litigation And Environmental Regulations That Could Adversely Impact Our Operating Results

We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability and
environmental matters, several of which claim significant damages. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We also are
subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or
damages under environmental laws.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Information appearing under “Overview”, “Results of Operations”, “Financial Position, Capital Resources and
Liquidity” and “Critical Accounting Policies” and the “Safe Harbor Statement” in the 2005 Annual Report are hereby incorporated by reference.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement Emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management
uses additional measures, including non-GAAP financial measures as such term is defined in Regulation G under the rules of the Securities Exchange Commission, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future.
These measures may exclude, for example, the impact of unique items (acquisitions, divestitures, one-time gains and losses) or items outside of management’s control (foreign currency exchange rates).

Underlying sales (which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the
periods presented, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates) are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth excluding these unique items.

Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin
(defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance
and actions required to improve profitability.


Earnings per share excluding gains from divestitures provides additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating
performance of the Company which facilitates period-to-period comparisons excluding the earnings impact of one-time gains from strategic portfolio decisions.

Earnings and earnings per share excluding the 2005 tax expense for earnings repatriation provides additional insight into the underlying operating performance of the
Company which facilitates comparison excluding the earnings impact of the one-time opportunity to repatriate earnings at a favorable tax rate.

Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) is an indicator of the Company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital
assets necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. Operating cash flow adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures.

While Emerson believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the
Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from
similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Controls and Procedures

Emerson maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC’s rules and forms. Based on an evaluation performed, the Company’s certifying officers have
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2005, to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of these objectives.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover
all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company’s reports.

There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2005, that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, and the related report of the Company’s independent auditor, KPMG LLP, a registered public
accounting firm, appearing in the 2005 Annual Report are hereby incorporated by reference.
