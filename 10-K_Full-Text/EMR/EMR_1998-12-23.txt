                                      PART I
 Item 1.  Business
 -----------------

 Emerson was incorporated in Missouri in 1890.  Originally engaged in
 the manufacture and sale of electric motors and fans, Emerson subsequently
 expanded its product lines through internal growth and acquisitions.
 Emerson is now engaged principally in the worldwide design, manufacture
 and sale of a broad range of electrical, electromechanical and electronic
 products and systems.

        ------------------------------------------------------

 The products manufactured by the Company are classified into the
 following industry segments: Commercial and Industrial Components and
 Systems, and Appliance and Construction-Related Components.  Net sales,
 income before income taxes and total assets attributable to each industry
 segment for the three years ended September 30, 1998, are set forth
 in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 39
 of the 1998 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by reference.
 Information with respect to acquisition and divestiture activities by Emerson
 is set forth in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
 page 33 of the 1998 Annual Report, which note is hereby incorporated by
 reference.

          COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS
          ------------------------------------------------

 The Commercial and Industrial segment includes process control
 instrumentation, valves and systems; industrial motors and drives;
 industrial machinery, equipment and components; and electronics.  These

             APPLIANCE AND CONSTRUCTION-RELATED COMPONENTS
             ---------------------------------------------

 The Appliance and Construction-Related segment consists of fractional motors
 and appliance components; heating, ventilating and air conditioning
 components; and tools. This segment includes components sold to distributors
 and original equipment manufacturers for inclusion in end products and systems
 (ultimately sold through commercial and residential building construction
 channels), and construction-related products which retain their identity and
 are sold through distributors to consumers and the professional trades.






 

 Emerson manufactures and sells a variety of components and systems for
 refrigeration and comfort control applications, including hermetic and semi-

 chisels.

 PRODUCTION
 ----------

 Emerson utilizes various production operations and methods.  The principal
 production operations are metal stamping, forming, casting, machining,
 welding, plating, heat treating, painting and assembly.  In addition,
 Emerson also uses specialized production operations, including automatic
 and semiautomatic testing, automated material handling and storage, ferrous
 and nonferrous machining and special furnaces for heat treating and foundry
 applications.  Management believes the equipment, machinery and tooling used
 in these processes are of modern design and are well maintained.

 RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY
 ------------------------

 Emerson's major requirements for basic raw materials include steel, copper,
 cast iron, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and other
 petroleum-based chemicals.  Emerson has multiple sources of supply for each
 of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one
 supplier.  The raw materials and various purchased components required for
 its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities.



 

 Emerson uses various forms of energy, principally natural gas and electricity,
 obtained from public utilities.  A majority of the plants have the capability
 of being converted to use alternative sources of energy.

 PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES
 --------------------------------------------

 The Company has a number of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises, none
 of which is considered material to any segment of its consolidated operations.

 BACKLOG
 -------

 The estimated consolidated order backlog of the Company was $2,084 million
 and $1,989 million at September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  Nearly all
 of the September 30, 1998 consolidated backlog amount is expected to be
 shipped within one year.  The estimated backlog by industry segment at
 September 30, 1998 and 1997, follows (dollars in millions):

                                                 1998          1997
                                               -------       -------
     Commercial and Industrial                 $ 1,361         1,331
     Appliance and Construction-Related            723           658
                                               -------       -------
          Consolidated Order Backlog           $ 2,084         1,989
                                               =======       =======

 COMPETITION
 -----------

 Emerson's businesses are highly competitive, and Emerson competes on product
 performance, quality, service or price across the industries and markets
 served.  A significant element of the Company's competitive strategy is its
 objective to manufacture high quality products at the lowest relevant global
 cost.  Although no single company competes directly with Emerson in all of the
 Company's product lines, various companies compete in one or more product
 lines.  Some of these companies have substantially greater sales and assets
 than Emerson, and Emerson also competes with many smaller companies.  The
 number of Emerson's competitors varies by product line, and management
 believes that Emerson has a market leadership position in many of these
 product lines.

 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 ------------------------

 Costs associated with Company-sponsored research, new product development
 and product improvement were $491.3 million in 1998, $445.1 million in 1997
 and $398.7 million in 1996.









 

 ENVIRONMENT
 -----------

 The Company's manufacturing locations generate waste, the treatment, storage,
 transportation and disposal of which are subject to federal, state and/or
 local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
 Compliance with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the
 environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not
 had a material effect upon Emerson's capital expenditures, earnings or
 competitive position.  It is not anticipated that Emerson will have material
 capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during the next
 fiscal year.

 EMPLOYEES
 ---------

 Emerson and its subsidiaries had an average of approximately 111,800 employees
 during 1998.  Management believes that the Company's employee relations are
 favorable.  Some of the Company's employees are represented by collective
 bargaining agreements, but none of these is considered significant.

 DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 -------------------------------

 International sales were $5,387 million in 1998, $5,245 million in 1997 and
 $4,867 million in 1996, including U.S. exports of $968 million, $1,054 million
 and $885 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  Although there are
 additional risks attendant to foreign operations, such as nationalization of
 facilities, currency fluctuations and restrictions on the movement of funds,
 Emerson's financial position has not been materially affected thereby to date.
 See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 39 of the
 1998 Annual Report for further information with respect to foreign operations.

 Item 2.  Properties
 -------------------

 At September 30, 1998, Emerson had approximately 370 manufacturing locations
 worldwide, of which approximately 190 were located outside the United States,
 primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin
 America.  Approximately 240 locations are occupied by the Commercial and
 Industrial segment, and approximately 130 are occupied by the Appliance and
 Construction-Related segment.  The majority of the locations are owned or
 occupied under capital lease obligations, with the remainder occupied under
 operating leases.  The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate
 for the purposes for which they are used.

 Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
 --------------------------

 Emerson is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings, several of which
 claim substantial amounts of damages.  There are no pending legal proceedings
 that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's
 business or financial position.




 

 Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 ------------------------------------------------------------

 There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
 quarter ended September 30, 1998.

             -------------------------------------------
