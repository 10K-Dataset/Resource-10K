                                      PART I
 Item 1.  Business
 -----------------

 Emerson was incorporated in Missouri in 1890.  Originally engaged in
 the manufacture and sale of electric motors and fans prior to World
 War II and aircraft armament items during the war, Emerson's product
 lines were subsequently expanded through internal growth and
 acquisitions.  Emerson is now engaged principally in the design,
 manufacture and sale of a broad range of electrical, electromechanical
 and electronic products and systems.

               -------------------------------

 The products manufactured by the Company are classified into the
 following industry segments: Commercial and Industrial Components and
 Systems; and Appliance and Construction-Related Components.  Net
 sales, income before income taxes and accounting change and total assets
 attributable to each industry segment for the three years ended
 September 30, 1994 are set forth in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
 Financial Statements on page 37 of the 1994 Annual Report, which note is
 hereby incorporated by reference. Information with respect to acquisition
 and divestiture activities by Emerson is set forth in Notes 2 and 11 of
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 31 and 36 of the 1994
 Annual Report, respectively, which notes are hereby incorporated by
 reference.

          COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS
          ------------------------------------------------

 The Commercial and Industrial segment includes process control
 instrumentation, valves and systems; industrial motors and drives;
 industrial machinery, equipment and components; and electronic products.
 These products are generally highly engineered, both in product design
 and manufacturing process. Products of this segment are sold to commercial

 PRODUCTION
 ----------

 Emerson utilizes various production operations and methods.  The
 principal production operations are metal stamping, forming, casting,
 machining, welding, plating, heat treating, painting and assembly.
 In addition, Emerson also uses specialized production operations,
 including automatic and semiautomatic testing, automated material
 handling and storage, ferrous and nonferrous machining and special
 furnaces for heat treating and foundry applications.  Management
 believes the equipment, machinery and tooling used in these processes
 are of modern design and well maintained.

 RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY
 ------------------------

 Emerson's major requirements for basic raw materials include steel,
 copper, cast iron, aluminum and brass and, to a lesser extent,
 plastics and other petroleum-based chemicals.  Emerson has multiple
 sources of supply for each of its material requirements.  The raw
 materials and various purchased components required for its products
 have generally been available in sufficient quantities.



 Emerson uses various forms of energy, principally natural gas and
 electricity, obtained from public utilities.  A majority of the plants
 have the capability of being converted to use alternative sources of
 energy.

 PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES
 --------------------------------------------

 The Company has a number of patents, trademarks, licenses and
 franchises, none of which is considered material to any segment of
 its consolidated operations.

 BACKLOG
 -------

 The estimated consolidated order backlog of the Company was $1,546
 million and $1,362 million at September 30, 1994 and 1993,
 respectively.  Of the 1994 consolidated year-end backlog amount, $40
 million is expected to extend beyond one year.  The estimated backlog
 by industry segment at September 30, 1994 and 1993 follows (dollars
 in millions):

                                              1994       1993
                                             -------     -----
     Commercial and Industrial               $ 1,000       958
     Appliance and Construction-Related          546       404
                                             -------     -----
            Consolidated Order Backlog       $ 1,546     1,362
                                             =======     =====

 COMPETITION
 -----------

 Emerson's businesses are highly competitive and the methods of
 competition vary across the industry segments served.  Although no
 single company competes directly with Emerson in all of its product
 lines, various companies compete in one or more product lines.  Some
 of these companies have substantially greater sales and assets than
 Emerson.  In addition, Emerson competes with many smaller companies.

 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 ------------------------

 Costs associated with Company-sponsored research, new product
 development and product improvement were $298.2 million in 1994,
 $272.4 million in 1993 and $244.8 million in 1992.

 ENVIRONMENT
 -----------

 Compliance with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the
 environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the







 environment has not had a material effect upon Emerson's capital
 expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  It is not
 anticipated that Emerson will have material capital expenditures for
 environmental control facilities during the next fiscal year.

 EMPLOYEES
 ---------

 Emerson and its subsidiaries had an average of approximately 73,900
 employees during 1994.

 DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 -------------------------------

 International sales were $3,243 million in 1994, $3,168 million in
 1993 and $3,064 million in 1992, including U.S. exports of $589
 million, $562 million and $486 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
 respectively.  Although there are additional risks attendant to
 foreign operations, such as nationalization of facilities, currency
 fluctuations and restrictions on the movement of funds, Emerson's
 financial position has not been materially affected thereby to date.
 See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 37
 of the 1994 Annual Report for further information with respect to
 foreign operations.

 Item 2.  Properties
 -------------------

 At September 30, 1994, Emerson had approximately 270 manufacturing
 locations worldwide, of which approximately 140 were located in 22
 countries outside the United  States.  Approximately 180 locations are
 occupied by the Commercial and Industrial segment, and approximately
 90 are occupied by the Appliance and Construction-Related segment.
 The majority of the locations are owned or occupied under capital lease
 obligations with the remainder occupied under operating leases.
 The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the
 purposes for which they are used.

 Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
 --------------------------

 Emerson is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings, several
 of which claim substantial amounts of damages.  There are no pending
 legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, are expected to
 be material in relation to the Company's business or financial
 position.

 Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 ------------------------------------------------------------

 There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during
 the quarter ended September 30, 1994.

 contained in the 1994 annual report to stockholders.  These
 consolidated financial statements and our report thereon are
