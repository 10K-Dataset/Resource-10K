GENERAL

We are a natural gas company originally incorporated under the
    laws of the state of Nevada in 1949 and reincorporated under the
    laws of the state of Delaware in 1987. We were founded in 1908
    when two Williams brothers began a construction company in
    Fort Smith, Arkansas. Today, we primarily find, produce,
    gather, process and transport natural gas. Our operations are
    concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Gulf
    Coast, Eastern Seaboard, and the province of Alberta in Canada.

Our principal executive offices are located at One Williams
    Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74172. Our telephone number is

918-573-2000.

In 2009, we used Economic Value
    Added

®

(EVA

®

)


as the basis for disciplined decision making around the use of
    capital.
    EVA

®

is a tool that considers both financial earnings and a cost of
    capital in measuring performance. It is based on the idea that
    earning profits from an economic perspective requires that a
    company cover not only all of its operating expenses but also
    all of its capital costs. The two main components of
    EVA

®

are net operating profit after taxes and a charge for the
    opportunity cost of capital. We derive these amounts by making
    various adjustments to our reported results and financial
    position, and by applying a cost of capital. We look for
    opportunities to improve
    EVA

®

because we believe there is a strong correlation between
    EVA

®

improvement and creation of shareholder value.

STRATEGIC
    RESTRUCTURING

On February 17, 2010, we completed a strategic
    restructuring, which involved contributing a substantial
    majority of our domestic midstream and gas pipeline businesses,
    including our limited- and general-partner interests in Williams
    Pipeline Partners L.P. (WMZ), into Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ).
    As consideration for the asset contributions, we received
    proceeds from WPZ’s debt issuance of approximately
    $3.5 billion, less WPZ’s transaction fees and
    expenses, as well as 203 million WPZ Class C units,
    which are identical to common units, except for a prorated
    initial distribution. We also maintained our 2 percent
    general-partner interest. WPZ assumed


Economic

    Value
    Added

(EVA

approximately $2 billion of existing debt associated with
    the gas pipeline assets. In connection with the restructuring,
    we retired $3 billion of our debt and paid
    $574 million in related premiums. These amounts, as well as
    other transaction costs, were primarily funded with the cash
    consideration received from WPZ. As a result of our
    restructuring, we are better positioned to drive additional
    growth and pursue value-adding growth strategies. Our new
    structure is designed to lower capital costs, enhance reliable
    access to capital markets, and create a greater ability to
    pursue development projects and acquisitions. (See Note 19
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In conjunction with the restructuring, WPZ has announced its
    intention to launch an exchange offer for the publicly traded
    common units of WMZ at a future date. WPZ will offer a fixed
    exchange ratio of 0.7584 of its common units for each WMZ common
    unit. The ratio is based on closing prices on the New York Stock
    Exchange on Friday, January 15, 2010, the business day
    before WPZ’s intention to make the exchange offer was
    announced, of $23.35 for WMZ and $30.79 for WPZ. The exact
    timing of the launch will be based upon the filing of necessary
    offering documents with the SEC and upon market conditions. If
    WPZ acquires ownership of more than 75% of WMZ’s
    outstanding common units pursuant to this offer, WPZ will
    consider causing the general partner of WMZ to
    (i) deregister WMZ under the Exchange Act or cause its
    common units to no longer be traded on the New York Stock
    Exchange, if these options are available, (ii) exercise its
    right under the WMZ’s limited partnership agreement to
    purchase all of the remaining common units or
    (iii) exercise any other available options.

Beginning with reporting of first-quarter 2010 results, we will
    change our segment reporting structure to align with the new
    parent-level focus, resource allocation management and related
    governance provisions resulting from the restructuring. Our
    reporting segments will be Williams Partners,
    Exploration & Production, and Other.
    Exploration & Production will include our current Gas
    Marketing Services (Gas Marketing) segment and Other will
    include certain midstream and gas pipeline businesses that were
    not contributed to WPZ, such as our Canadian and olefins
    midstream businesses and the remaining 25.5 percent
    interest in Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream),
    as well as corporate operations.

Information in this report has generally been prepared to be
    consistent with the reportable segment presentation in our
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8
    of this document, which reflects our segment reporting structure
    prior to the restructuring. These segments are discussed in
    further detail in the following sections.

FINANCIAL
    INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

See “Item 8 — Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Note 18” of our Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for information with respect
    to each segment’s revenues, profits or losses and total
    assets.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Substantially all our operations are conducted through our
    subsidiaries. To achieve organizational and operating
    efficiencies, our activities in 2009 were primarily operated
    through the following business segments:

•

Exploration & Production

— produces,
    develops and manages natural gas reserves primarily located in
    the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States and is comprised of several wholly owned and partially
    owned subsidiaries including Williams Production Company, LLC,
    and Williams Production RMT Company (RMT).

•

Gas Pipeline

— includes our interstate natural
    gas pipelines and pipeline joint venture investments organized
    under our wholly owned subsidiary, Williams Gas Pipeline
    Company, LLC (WGP). Gas Pipeline also includes Williams Pipeline
    Partners L.P. (WMZ), our master limited partnership formed in
    2007.

•

Midstream Gas & Liquids

— includes
    our natural gas gathering, treating and processing business and
    is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned
    subsidiaries including Williams Field Services Group, LLC and
    Williams Natural Gas Liquids, Inc. Midstream Gas & Liquids
    (Midstream) also includes Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ), our
    master limited partnership formed in 2005.



•

Gas Marketing Services

— manages our natural
    gas commodity risk through purchases, sales and other related
    transactions, under our wholly owned subsidiary Williams Gas
    Marketing, Inc.

•

Other

— primarily consists of corporate
    operations.

This report is organized to reflect this structure.

Detailed discussion of each of our business segments follows.

Exploration &
    Production

Our Exploration & Production segment produces,
    develops, and manages natural gas reserves primarily located in
    the Rocky Mountain (primarily Colorado, New Mexico, and
    Wyoming), Mid-Continent (Oklahoma and Texas), and Appalachian
    regions of the United States. We specialize in natural gas
    production from tight-sands and shale formations and coal bed
    methane reserves in the Piceance, San Juan, Powder River,
    Arkoma, Green River, Fort Worth, and Appalachian basins.
    Over 99 percent of our domestic reserves are natural gas.
    We also have international oil and gas interests, which include
    a 69 percent equity interest in Apco Oil and Gas
    International Inc. (formerly Apco Argentina Inc., NASDAQ listed:
    APAGF), an oil and gas exploration and production company with
    operations in South America. If combined with our domestic
    proved reserves, our international interests would make up
    approximately 4 percent of our total proved reserves.
    Considering this, the reserves information included in this
    section relates only to our domestic activity.

Our goal is to continue to drill our existing proved undeveloped
    reserves, which comprise approximately 44 percent of proved
    reserves, and to drill in areas of probable and possible
    reserves in order to add to our proved reserves. Our current
    proved, probable, and possible reserves inventory provides us
    with strong capital investment opportunities for many years into
    the future.

On January 14, 2009, the SEC issued the

Final Rule for
    Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting

which modifies how
    oil and gas companies report reserves estimates. We have adopted
    the revised SEC oil and gas reporting requirements, effective as
    of December 31, 2009, with the following effects:

•

Applying the expanded definition of oil and gas reserves used
    for reserves estimation supported by reliable technologies and
    reasonable certainty.

•

Choosing to disclose two alternative reserves sensitivity
    scenarios.

•

Revising proved undeveloped reserves estimates based on new
    guidance.

•

Estimating reserves for SEC disclosure using the

12-month

average,

first-of-the-month

price instead of a

single-day,

period-end price.

•

Incorporating certain additional disclosures around proved
    undeveloped reserves, internal controls used to ensure
    objectivity of the estimation process, and qualifications of
    those preparing

and/or

auditing the reserves.

Oil
    and Gas Reserves

Reserves information is reported as gas equivalents, since oil
    volumes are insignificant. Reserves are more than 99 percent
    natural gas for all periods indicated.

    (DOE) and the SEC. The estimates furnished to the DOE have been
    consistent with those furnished to the SEC.



Proved
    reserves sensitivities price scenario

The new SEC rules allow for reserves sensitivity analysis using
    alternate price and cost criteria as shown below. The SEC case
    was derived using the

12-month

average,

first-of-the-month

Henry Hub spot price of $3.87 per MMbtu, adjusted for locational
    price differentials. Neither of the sensitivity scenarios was
    audited by a third party. All three cases assume that proved
    undeveloped reserves are drilled within five years. No changes
    were made to capital expenditures or operating costs in the
    sensitivity scenarios.

Sensitivity 1: Reflects proved reserves estimated by adding
    $1.00 to each of the basin prices from the SEC case.

Sensitivity 2: Reflects proved reserves estimated using prices
    from the prior year-end, which were calculated using the
    December 31, 2008, NYMEX Henry Hub posted price of $5.71
    per MMbtu, adjusted for locational price differentials.

The chart below shows the year-end 2009 SEC case compared to the
    two alternate price scenarios. Also shown is the impact the new
    SEC reserves rules had on 2009 proved reserves.

Proved
    U.S. Reserves Reconciliation



The new SEC reporting rules require that year-end proved reserve
    volumes are calculated using an average price for the full-year
    2009, rather than the year-end price. This resulted in
    utilization of a basin price approximately 33 percent lower
    than the previous year which resulted in a downward price
    revision of 336 Bcfe.

Under the new rules, reserves generally cannot be classified as
    proved if they have not or will not be developed within five
    years according to planned drilling activity and taking into
    account anticipated proved undeveloped conversion rates for
    wells drilled. This rule change resulted in reclassification of
    496 Bcfe of reserves from proved undeveloped to probable.

Additionally, the new rules now allow adding undeveloped proved
    reserves locations that are more than one offset away from
    currently producing wells where there is reasonable certainty of
    production. This rule change resulted in the addition of
    454 Bcfe of proved reserves.

Also shown on the chart is 570 Bcfe of net
    additions/revisions to our proved reserves through drilling
    882 gross wells in 2009 at a capital cost of approximately
    $878 million.

Reserves
    estimation process

The engineering staff of each basin asset team provides the
    reserves modeling and forecasts for their respective areas.
    Various departments also participate in the preparation of the
    year-end reserves estimate. These departments provide supporting
    information such as pricing, ownership, gas gathering and gas
    quality. The departments and their roles in the year-end
    reserves process are coordinated by our reserves analysis
    department. The reserves analysis department’s
    responsibilities also include: working with the third-party
    consultants and the asset teams to successfully complete the
    third-party reserves audit, performing an internal review of
    reserves data for reasonableness and accuracy, finalizing the
    year-end reserves report, and reporting reserves data to
    accounting.

The preparation of our year-end reserves report is a formal
    process. We begin with a review of the existing process to
    identify where improvements can be made. Our internal processes
    and controls, as they relate to the year-end reserves, are
    reviewed and updated. Each asset teams’ reserves
    engineering and geological technical staffs, the reserves
    analysis team, and the third-party engineering consultants meet
    to begin the year-end process and audit.  The asset teams’
    reserves staff, the reserves analysis team and the third-party
    engineering consultants exchange data and interpretations in
    furtherance of the completion of the year-end reserves
    estimates. The reserves analysis team met twice with the Audit
    Committee of our Board of Directors to report on the progress of
    its analysis of our 2009 reserves, allowing the Audit Committee
    the opportunity to review and comment on management’s
    processes and conclusions.

Approximately 99 percent of our total year-end 2009
    domestic proved reserves estimates were audited by Netherland,
    Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI). When compared on a

well-by-well

basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than
    the estimates of NSAI. However, in the opinion of NSAI, the
    estimates of our proved reserves are in the aggregate reasonable
    and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
    petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. These
    principles are set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the
    Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information
    promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. NSAI is
    satisfied with our methods and procedures in preparing the
    December 31, 2009, reserves estimates and noted nothing of
    an unusual nature that would cause NSAI to take exception with
    the estimates, in the aggregate, as prepared by us. The report
    of NSAI is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this

Form 10-K.

In addition, reserves estimates related to properties underlying
    the Williams Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust, of which our ownership
    in the Trust represents approximately 1 percent of our
    total domestic proved reserves estimates, were prepared by
    Miller and Lents, LTD. The report of Miller and Lents is
    included as Exhibit 99.2 to this

Form 10-K.

The reserves estimates resulting from the above process are
    subjected to both internal and external checks and controls to
    promote transparency and accuracy of the year-end reserves
    estimates. Our internal control documentation provides further
    confirmation on the checks and controls. Our internal reserves
    analysis team is independent and does not work within an asset
    team or report directly to anyone on the asset teams. The
    compensation of our reserves analysis team is not linked to
    reserves additions or revisions.



The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing
    preparation of the reserves estimates and the third- party
    reserves audit is the Director of Reserves and Production
    Services. The Director’s qualifications include
    27 years of reserves evaluation experience, a B.S. in
    geology from the University of Texas at Austin, an M.S. in
    physical sciences from the University of Houston, and membership
    in the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, and The
    Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Proved
    undeveloped reserves

Our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2009,
    are 1,868 Bcfe and 1,883 Bcfe as of December 31,
    2008, a net decrease of approximately 15 Bcfe. See
    additional discussion of proved undeveloped reserves in our
    sensitivity analysis.

The vast majority of our reserves is concentrated in
    unconventional tight gas sands, shale gas and coal bed gas
    reservoirs. We use available geoscience and engineering data to
    establish drainage areas and continuity of reservoir beyond one
    direct offset from a producing well, which provides additional
    proved undeveloped bookings in fields where the evidence
    supported the methodology. Inherent in the methodology was a
    requirement for significant well density of economically
    producing wells to establish those bookings with reasonable
    certainty. In fields where producing wells were less dense, only
    direct offsets from proved producing wells were assigned the
    proved undeveloped reserves classification.

Drilling
    and Exploratory Activities

We focus on lower-risk development drilling. Our development
    drilling success rate was approximately 99 percent in each
    of 2009, 2008, and 2007.

We use the terms “gross” to refer to all wells or

    “net” to refer to our ownership represented by that
    working interest. All of the wells drilled were natural gas
    wells.

In 2009, there were two gross nonproductive exploratory wells
    and one net nonproductive exploratory well. Total gross operated
    wells drilled were 472 in 2009, 1,125 in 2008, and 1,112 in 2007.

Present
    Activities

At December 31, 2009, we had 42 gross (14 net) wells
    in the process of being drilled.

Delivery
    Commitments

We hold a long-term obligation, through our Gas Marketing
    segment, to deliver on a firm basis 200,000 MMBtu/d of gas
    to a buyer at the White River Hub (Greasewood-Meeker, Colorado),
    which is the major market hub exiting the Piceance basin. The
    Piceance, being our largest producing basin, holds ample
    reserves to fulfill this obligation without risk of
    nonperformance during periods of normal infrastructure and
    market operations. While the daily volume of gas is large and
    represents a significant percentage of our daily production,
    this transaction does not represent a material exposure.

    “net” to refer to our ownership represented by that
    working interest. All of the wells drilled were natural gas
    wells. Volumes are reported in gas equivalents since any liquids
    produced are a by-product of the natural gas wells.



At December 31, 2009, there were 181 gross and

Piceance
    basin

The Piceance basin is located in northwestern Colorado and is
    our largest area of concentrated development. During 2009 we
    operated an average of 10.3 drilling rigs in the basin. This
    area has approximately 1972 undrilled proved locations in
    inventory. Within this basin we own and operate natural gas
    gathering facilities including some 300 miles of gathering
    lines and associated field compression. Approximately
    85 percent of the gas gathered is our own equity
    production. The gathering system also includes 5 processing
    plants and associated treating facilities for a total capacity
    of 1.15 Bcf/d. During 2009, these plants recovered
    approximately 6.3 million gallons of natural gas liquids
    (NGLs) each month, which were marketed separately from the
    residue natural gas.

In addition to our own operated facilities, Midstream owns and
    operates a new cryogenic processing plant, Willow Creek, which
    currently has a capacity of

450 MMcf/d

and reprocesses that amount of gas, recovering an average of
    12.6 million additional gallons of NGLs per month, which
    were marketed separately from the residue natural gas.

San Juan
    basin

The San Juan basin is located in northwest New Mexico and
    southwest Colorado. We provide a significant amount of equity
    production that is gathered

and/or

processed by Midstream’s facilities in the San Juan
    basin.

Powder
    River basin

The Powder River basin is located in northeast Wyoming. The
    Powder River basin includes large areas with multiple coal seam
    potential, targeting thick coal bed methane formations at
    shallow depths. We have a significant inventory of undrilled
    locations, providing long-term drilling opportunities.

Mid-Continent
    properties

The Mid-Continent properties are located in the southeastern
    Oklahoma portion of the Arkoma basin and the Barnett Shale in
    the Fort Worth basin of Texas.

Other
    properties

Other properties are primarily comprised of interests in the
    Green River basin in southwestern Wyoming and the Appalachian
    basin (Marcellus Shale) in Pennsylvania. Also included is
    exploration activity and other miscellaneous activity.

Hedging
    Activity

To manage the commodity price risk and volatility of owning
    producing gas properties, we enter into derivative contracts for
    a portion of our expected future production. See further
    discussion in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Exploration & Production

, included in Item 7
    of this

Form 10-K.



Acquisitions &
    Divestitures

In June 2009, we entered into an agreement that allows us to
    acquire, through a “drill to earn” structure, a
    50 percent interest in approximately 44,000 net acres
    in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian basin.
    This agreement requires us to fund $33 million of drilling
    and completion costs on behalf of our partner and
    $41 million of our own costs and expenses prior to the end
    of 2011 to earn our 50 percent interest. This growth
    opportunity leverages our experience in developing
    nonconventional natural gas reserves. Through December 2009, we
    have funded $14 million of the $33 million.

In September 2009, we completed the purchase of additional
    unproved leasehold acreage and proved properties in the Piceance
    basin for $253 million. In December 2009, we increased our
    working interest in these properties through a $22 million
    acquisition.

Through other transactions totaling approximately
    $36 million, Exploration & Production expanded
    its acreage position and producing properties in the
    Fort Worth basin (Barnett Shale), the Appalachian basin
    (Marcellus Shale), the Arkoma basin (Woodford Shale), as well as
    exploration leaseholds in the Paradox basin.

Other
    Information

In 1993, Exploration & Production conveyed a net
    profits interest in certain of its properties to the Williams
    Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust (“Trust”). Substantially
    all of the production attributable to the properties conveyed to
    the Trust was from the Fruitland coal formation and constituted
    coal seam gas. We subsequently sold Trust units to the public in
    an underwritten public offering and retained 3,568,791 Trust
    units then representing 36.8 percent of outstanding Trust
    units. We have previously sold Trust units on the open market,
    with our last sales in June 2005. As of March 1, 2010, we
    expect to own 789,291 trust units. Based on certain provisions
    of the Trust agreement, the Trust is expected to terminate on
    March 1, 2010. Upon termination, the net profits interest
    will be placed for sale and we will receive proceeds from the
    sale less applicable expenses in direct proportion to the Trust
    units owned. This transaction is expected to have a minimal
    impact to our financial statements.

Gas
    Pipeline

We own and operate a combined total of approximately
    13,900 miles of pipelines with a total annual throughput of
    approximately 2,700 TBtu of natural gas and

peak-day

delivery capacity of approximately 12 MMdt of gas. Gas
    Pipeline consists of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC
    (Transco) and Northwest Pipeline GP (Northwest Pipeline). Gas
    Pipeline also holds interests in joint venture interstate and
    intrastate natural gas pipeline systems including a
    50 percent interest in Gulfstream. Gas Pipeline also
    includes WMZ.

Transco

Transco is an interstate natural gas transportation company that
    owns and operates a 10,000-mile natural gas pipeline system
    extending from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the offshore
    Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North
    Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to
    the New York City metropolitan area. The system serves customers
    in Texas and 11 southeast and Atlantic seaboard states,
    including major metropolitan areas in Georgia, North Carolina,
    Washington, D.C., New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2009, Transco’s system had a mainline
    delivery capacity of approximately 4.7 MMdt of natural gas
    per day from its production areas to its primary markets. Using
    its Leidy Line along with market-area storage and transportation
    capacity, Transco can deliver an additional 3.9 MMdt of
    natural gas per day for a system-wide delivery capacity total of
    approximately 8.6 MMdt of natural gas per day.
    Transco’s system includes 45 compressor stations, four
    underground storage fields, and a liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    storage facility. Compression facilities at sea level-rated
    capacity total approximately 1.5 million horsepower.

Transco’s major natural gas transportation customers are
    public utilities and municipalities that provide service to
    residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation end
    users. Shippers on Transco’s system include public
    utilities, municipalities, intrastate pipelines, direct
    industrial users, electrical generators, gas



marketers and producers. One customer accounted for
    approximately 11 percent and another customer accounted for
    approximately 10 percent of Transco’s total revenues
    in 2009. Transco’s firm transportation agreements are
    generally long-term agreements with various expiration dates and
    account for the major portion of Transco’s business.
    Additionally, Transco offers storage services and interruptible
    transportation services under short-term agreements.

Transco has natural gas storage capacity in four underground
    storage fields located on or near its pipeline system or market
    areas and operates two of these storage fields. Transco also has
    storage capacity in an LNG storage facility that they own and
    operate. The total usable gas storage capacity available to
    Transco and its customers in such underground storage fields and
    LNG storage facility and through storage service contracts is
    approximately 204 billion cubic feet of gas. In addition,
    wholly owned subsidiaries of Transco operate and hold a
    35 percent ownership interest in Pine Needle LNG Company,
    LLC, a LNG storage facility with 4 billion cubic feet of
    storage capacity. Storage capacity permits Transco’s
    customers to inject gas into storage during the summer and
    off-peak periods for delivery during peak winter demand periods.

    in the market area. Long-haul transportation involves gas that
    Transco receives in one of the production-area zones and
    delivers to a market-area zone. Market-area transportation
    involves gas that Transco both receives and delivers within the
    market-area zones. Production-area transportation involves gas
    that Transco both receives and delivers within the
    production-area zones.

Northwest
    Pipeline

Northwest Pipeline is an interstate natural gas transportation
    company that owns and operates a natural gas pipeline system
    extending from the San Juan basin in northwestern New
    Mexico and southwestern Colorado through Colorado, Utah,
    Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to a point on the
    Canadian border near Sumas, Washington. Northwest Pipeline
    provides services for markets in California, Arizona, New
    Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, and
    Washington directly or indirectly through interconnections with
    other pipelines.

Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2009, Northwest Pipeline’s system,
    having long-term firm transportation agreements including
    peaking service of approximately 3.7 Bcf of natural gas per
    day, was composed of approximately 3,900 miles of mainline
    and lateral transmission pipelines and 41 transmission
    compressor stations having a combined sea level-rated capacity
    of approximately 473,000 horsepower.



In 2009, Northwest Pipeline served a total of 127 transportation
    and storage customers. Northwest Pipeline transports and stores
    natural gas for a broad mix of customers, including local
    natural gas distribution companies, municipal utilities, direct
    industrial users, electric power generators and natural gas
    marketers and producers. The two largest customers of Northwest
    Pipeline in 2009 accounted for approximately 22 percent and
    12 percent, respectively, of its total operating revenues.
    No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of
    Northwest Pipeline’s total operating revenues in 2009.
    Northwest Pipeline’s firm transportation and storage
    contracts are generally long-term contracts with various
    expiration dates and account for the major portion of Northwest
    Pipeline’s business. Additionally, Northwest Pipeline
    offers interruptible and short-term firm transportation service.

As a part of its transportation services, Northwest Pipeline
    utilizes underground storage facilities in Utah and Washington
    enabling it to balance daily receipts and deliveries. Northwest
    Pipeline also owns and operates an LNG storage facility in
    Washington that provides service for customers during a few days
    of extreme demands. These storage facilities have an aggregate
    firm delivery capacity of approximately 700 MMcf of gas per
    day.

Northwest
    Pipeline expansion projects

The pipeline projects listed below were completed during 2009 or
    are significant future pipeline projects for which we have
    customer commitments.

Colorado
    Hub Connection Project

In November 2009, Northwest Pipeline placed into service the new

27-mile,

24-inch

diameter lateral referred to as the Colorado Hub Project (CHC
    Project). The new lateral connects the Meeker/White River Hub
    near Meeker, Colorado to its mainline south of Rangely,
    Colorado, and is estimated to cost up to $60 million. The
    CHC Project combined the new lateral capacity with existing
    mainline capacity to provide approximately 363 Mdth per day of
    firm transportation from various receipt points to delivery
    points on the mainline as far south as Ignacio, Colorado. In
    April 2009, the FERC issued a certificate approving the CHC
    Project, including the presumption of rolling in the costs of
    the project in any future rate case filed with the FERC.

Sundance
    Trail Expansion

In November 2009, Northwest Pipeline received approval from the
    FERC to construct approximately 16 miles of

30-inch

loop
    between Northwest Pipeline’s existing Green River and Muddy
    Creek compressor stations in Wyoming as well as an upgrade to
    Northwest Pipeline’s existing Vernal compressor station,
    with service targeted to commence in November 2010. The total
    project is estimated to cost up to $65 million, including
    the cost of replacing the existing compression at Vernal, which
    will enhance the efficiency of Northwest Pipeline’s system.
    Northwest Pipeline executed a precedent agreement to provide 150
    Mdth per day of firm transportation service from the Greasewood
    and Meeker Hubs in Colorado for delivery to the Opal Hub in
    Wyoming. Northwest Pipeline has proposed to collect its maximum
    system rates, and has received approval from the FERC to roll-in
    the Sundance Trail Expansion costs in any future rate cases.

Gulfstream

Gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system extending from the
    Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in Florida. Gas Pipeline
    and Spectra Energy, through their respective subsidiaries, each
    holds a 50 percent ownership interest in Gulfstream and
    provides operating services for Gulfstream. At December 31,
    2009, our equity investment in Gulfstream was $383 million.

Gulfstream
    expansion projects

Gulfstream placed the Phase III expansion project in
    service on September 1, 2008. The project extended the
    pipeline system into South Florida and fully subscribed the
    remaining 345 Mdt/d of firm capacity on the existing pipeline
    system on a long-term basis. The capital cost of this project
    was $118 million, with Gas Pipeline’s share being
    50 percent of such costs. Service under the Gulfstream
    Phase IV expansion project began during the fourth quarter
    of 2008. The project is fully subscribed on a long-term basis
    and is the first incremental expansion of Gulfstream’s
    mainline capacity. The capital cost of this expansion was
    $190 million, with Gas Pipeline’s share being
    50 percent of such costs. The Phase V expansion involves
    the addition of compression to provide 35 Mdt/d of firm capacity
    by July 2011. The estimated capital cost of this expansion is
    approximately $54 million with Gas Pipeline’s share
    being 50 percent of such cost.

WMZ

WMZ was formed to own and operate natural gas transportation and
    storage assets. As of December 31, 2009, we own an
    approximate 45.7 percent limited partnership interest and a
    2 percent general partner interest in WMZ. A subsidiary of
    ours, Williams Pipeline GP LLC, serves as the general partner of
    WMZ. WMZ owns a 35 percent interest in Northwest Pipeline.

As previously discussed, our overall ownership in WMZ was
    affected by our restructuring transactions in 2010. WPZ intends
    to make an exchange offer for the publicly held units of WMZ at
    a future date. See “Strategic Restructuring” in
    Part I, Item 1 of this Form

10-K

for
    further discussion of this potential exchange offer.

Midstream
    Gas & Liquids

Our Midstream segment, one of the nation’s largest natural
    gas gatherers and processors, has primary service areas
    concentrated in major producing basins in Colorado, New Mexico,
    Wyoming, the Gulf of Mexico, Pennsylvania, and western Canada.
    Midstream’s primary businesses — natural gas
    gathering, treating, and processing; NGL fractionation, storage
    and transportation; and oil transportation — fall
    within the middle of the process of taking raw natural gas and
    crude oil from the producing fields to the consumer. NGLs,
    ethylene and propylene are extracted/produced at our plants,
    including our Canadian and Gulf Coast olefins plants. These
    products are used primarily for the manufacture of
    petrochemicals, home heating fuels and refinery feedstock.

Key variables for the Midstream business will continue to be:

•

Retaining and attracting customers by continuing to provide
    reliable services;

•

Revenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either
    completed or currently under construction;

•

Disciplined growth in our core service areas and new step-out
    areas;

•

Prices impacting our commodity-based processing and olefin
    activities.



Domestic
    Gathering, Processing and Treating

Our domestic gathering systems receive natural gas from
    producers’ oil and natural gas wells and gather these
    volumes to gas processing, treating or redelivery facilities.
    Typically, natural gas, in its raw form, is not acceptable for
    transportation in major interstate natural gas pipelines or for
    commercial use as a fuel. In addition, natural gas contains
    various amounts of NGLs, which generally have a higher value
    when separated from the natural gas stream. Our processing and
    treating plants remove water vapor, carbon dioxide and other
    contaminants and our processing plants extract the NGLs and
    olefins. NGL products include:

•

Ethane, primarily used in the petrochemical industry as a
    feedstock for ethylene production, one of the basic building
    blocks for plastics;

•

Propane, used for heating, fuel and as a petrochemical feedstock
    in the production of ethylene and propylene, another building
    block for petrochemical-based products such as carpets, packing
    materials and molded plastic parts;

•

Normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline, primarily used
    by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor gasoline
    or as a petrochemical feedstock.

Although a significant portion of our gas processing services
    are performed for a volumetric-based fee, a portion of our gas
    processing agreements are commodity-based and include two
    distinct types of commodity exposure. The first type includes
    “keep-whole” processing agreements whereby we own the
    rights to the value from NGLs recovered at our plants and have
    the obligation to replace the lost heating value with natural
    gas. Under these agreements, we are exposed to the spread
    between NGL prices and natural gas prices. The second type
    consists of

“percent-of-liquids”

agreements whereby we receive a portion of the extracted liquids
    with no direct exposure to the price of natural gas. Under these
    agreements, we are only exposed to NGL price movements. NGLs we
    retain in connection with both of these types of processing
    agreements are referred to as our equity NGL production. Our
    gathering and processing agreements have terms ranging from

month-to-month

to the life of the producing lease. Generally, our gathering and
    processing agreements are long-term agreements.

Our domestic gas gathering and processing customers are
    generally natural gas producers who have proved

and/or

producing natural gas fields in the areas surrounding our
    infrastructure. During 2009, these operations gathered and
    processed gas for approximately 230 gas gathering and processing
    customers. Our top 7 gathering and processing customers
    accounted for approximately 50 percent of our domestic
    gathering and processing revenue.

In addition to our natural gas assets, we own and operate three
    deepwater crude oil pipelines and own two production platforms
    serving the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Our crude oil
    transportation revenues are typically volumetric-based fee
    arrangements. However, a portion of our marketing revenues are
    recognized from purchase and sale arrangements whereby we
    purchase oil from producers at the receipt points of our crude
    oil pipelines for an index-based price and resell the oil at
    delivery points at the same index-based price. Our offshore
    floating production platform provides centralized services to
    deepwater producers such as compression, separation, production
    handling, water removal and pipeline landings. Revenue sources
    have historically included a combination of fixed-fee,
    volumetric-based fee and cost reimbursement arrangements. Fixed
    fees associated with the resident production at our Devils Tower
    facility are recognized on a

units-of-production

basis.

Geographically, our Midstream natural gas assets are positioned
    to maximize commercial and operational synergies with our other
    assets. For example, most of our offshore gathering and
    processing assets attach and process or condition natural gas
    supplies delivered to the Transco pipeline. Also, our gathering
    and processing facilities in the San Juan basin handle
    approximately 87 percent of our Exploration &
    Production segment’s equity production in this basin. Our
    Willow Creek plant, completed in 2009, is currently processing
    Exploration & Production segment’s wellhead
    production in the Piceance basin. Our San Juan basin,
    southwest Wyoming, and Willow Creek systems deliver residue gas
    volumes into Northwest Pipeline’s interstate system in
    addition to third-party interstate systems.

West
    region domestic gathering, processing and treating

We own

and/or

operate domestic gas gathering, processing and treating assets
    within the western states of Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico.



In the Rocky Mountain area, our assets include:

•

Approximately 3,500 miles of gathering pipelines with a
    capacity of nearly one Bcf/d and over 4,000 receipt points
    serving the Wamsutter and southwest Wyoming areas in Wyoming;

•

Opal and Echo Springs processing plants with a combined daily
    inlet capacity of over

1,800 MMcf/d

and NGL processing capacity of nearly 100 Mbbls/d.

In the Four Corners area, our assets include:

•

Approximately 3,800 miles of gathering pipelines with a
    capacity of nearly two Bcf/d and approximately 6,500 receipt
    points serving the San Juan basin in New Mexico and
    Colorado;

•

Ignacio, Kutz and Lybrook processing plants with a combined
    daily inlet capacity of

765 MMcf/d

and NGL processing capacity of approximately 40 Mbbls/d.
    The Ignacio plant also has the capacity to produce slightly more
    than one Mbbls/d of liquefied natural gas;

•

Milagro and Esperanza natural gas treating plants, which remove
    carbon dioxide but do not extract NGLs, with a combined daily
    inlet capacity of

750 MMcf/d.

At our Milagro facility, we also use gas-driven turbines to
    produce approximately 60 mega-watts per day of electricity which
    we primarily sell into the local electrical grid.

In the Piceance basin in Colorado, our infrastructure includes:

•

The Willow Creek processing plant, a

450 MMcf/d

cryogenic natural gas processing plant in western
    Colorado’s Piceance basin, designed to recover
    30 Mbbls/d of NGLs. In the third quarter of 2009,
    construction was finished and the plant began operations. The
    plant is currently operating at its designed inlet capacity. In
    the current processing arrangement with Exploration &
    Production, Midstream receives a volumetric-based processing fee
    and a percent of the NGLs extracted.

•

Parachute Lateral, a

38-mile,

30-inch

diameter line transporting gas from the Parachute area to the
    Greasewood hub and White River hub in northwest Colorado. Our
    Willow Creek plant processes gas flowing through the Parachute
    Lateral.

•

PGX pipeline delivering NGLs previously transported by truck
    from Exploration & Production’s existing
    Parachute area processing plants to a major NGL transportation
    pipeline system.

West
    region expansion projects

Our major capital and expansion projects include additional
    capacity at our Echo Springs facility and related gathering
    system expansions in the Wamsutter basin. We expect to
    significantly increase the processing and NGL production
    capacities at our Echo Springs cryogenic natural gas processing
    plant in Wyoming. The addition of a fourth cryogenic processing
    train will add approximately

350 MMcf/d

of processing capacity and 30 Mbbls/d of NGL production
    capacity, nearly doubling Echo Spring’s capacities in both
    cases. We began construction on the fourth train at Echo Springs
    during the second half of 2009 and expect to bring the
    additional capacity online during late 2010.

Gulf
    region domestic gathering, processing and treating

We own

and/or

operate domestic gas gathering and processing assets and crude
    oil pipelines primarily within the onshore and offshore shelf
    and deepwater areas in and around the Gulf Coast states of
    Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. We own:

•

Over 700 miles of onshore and offshore natural gas
    gathering pipelines with a combined capacity of approximately
    3.5 Bcf/d, including:

•

The

115-mile

deepwater Seahawk gas pipeline in the western Gulf of Mexico,
    flowing into our Markham processing plant and serving the
    Boomvang and Nansen field areas;



•

The

139-mile

Canyon Chief gas pipeline, now including the

37-mile

Blind Faith extension added in the fourth quarter of 2008, in
    the eastern Gulf of Mexico, flowing into our Mobile Bay
    processing plant and serving the Devils Tower, Triton,
    Goldfinger, Bass Lite and Blind Faith fields;

•

Mobile Bay and Markham processing plants with a combined daily
    inlet capacity of

1,000 MMcf/d

and NGL handling capacity of 50 Mbbls/d;

•

Canyon Station production platform, which brings natural gas to
    specifications allowable by major interstate pipelines but does
    not extract NGLs, with a daily inlet capacity of

500 MMcf/d;

•

Three deepwater crude oil pipelines with a combined length of
    300 miles and capacity of 325 Mbbls/d including:

•

BANJO pipeline running parallel to the Seahawk gas pipeline
    delivering production from two producer-owned spar-type floating
    production systems; and delivering production to our
    shallow-water platform at Galveston Area Block A244 (GA-A244)
    and then onshore through ExxonMobil’s Hoover Offshore Oil
    Pipeline System (HOOPS);

•

Alpine pipeline in the central Gulf of Mexico, serving the
    Gunnison field, and delivering production to GA-A244 and then
    onshore through HOOPS under a joint tariff agreement;

•

Mountaineer oil pipeline which connects to similar production
    sources as our Canyon Chief pipeline and, now including the new
    Blind Faith extension, ultimately delivering production to
    ChevronTexaco’s Empire Terminal in Plaquemines Parish,
    Louisiana;

•

Devils Tower production platform located in Mississippi Canyon
    Block 773, approximately 150 miles south-southwest of
    Mobile, Alabama and serving production from the Devils Tower,
    Triton, Goldfinger and Bass Lite fields. Located in
    5,610 feet of water, it is one of the world’s deepest
    dry tree spars. The platform, which is operated by ENI Petroleum
    on our behalf, is capable of handling

210 MMcf/d

of natural gas and 60 Mbbls/d of oil.

Gulf
    region expansion projects

Our current major expansion project in the Gulf region is our
    Perdido Norte project located in the western deepwater of the
    Gulf of Mexico. The investment expands our existing
    infrastructure and includes a total of 184 miles of deepwater
    oil and gas pipeline and a

200 MMcf/d

expansion of our onshore Markham gas processing facility. We
    expect the project to begin

start-up

operations in the first quarter of 2010.

Olefins

Gulf
    Coast region olefins

In the Gulf of Mexico region, we own a 10/12 interest in and are
    the operator of an ethane cracker at Geismar, Louisiana, with a
    total production capacity of 1.3 billion pounds of ethylene
    and 90 million pounds of propylene per year. Our feedstock
    for the ethane cracker is ethane and propane; as a result, we
    are exposed to the price spread between ethane and propane, and
    ethylene and propylene, respectively. We also own ethane and
    propane pipeline systems and a refinery grade propylene splitter
    with a production capacity of approximately 500 million
    pounds per year of propylene and its related pipeline system in
    Louisiana. At our propylene splitter, we purchase refinery grade
    propylene and fractionate it into polymer grade propylene and
    propane; as a result we are exposed to the price spread between
    those commodities.

Canadian
    region olefins

Our Canadian operations include an oil sands off-gas processing
    plant located near Ft. McMurray, Alberta and an NGL/olefin
    fractionation facility near Edmonton, Alberta. Our facilities
    extract liquids from the off-gas produced by a third-party oil
    sands bitumen upgrading process. Our arrangement with the
    third-party upgrader is a “keep-whole” type where we
    remove a mix of NGLs and olefins from the off-gas and return the
    equivalent heating value back to the third party in the form of
    natural gas. We then fractionate, treat, store, terminal and
    sell the



propane, propylene, butane, butylenes and condensate recovered
    from this process. Our commodity price exposure is the spread
    between the price for natural gas and the NGL and olefin
    products we produce. We continue to be the only NGL/olefins
    fractionator in western Canada and the only treater/processor of
    oil sands upgrader off-gas. Our extraction of liquids from
    upgrader off-gas streams allows the upgraders to burn cleaner
    natural gas streams and reduce their overall air emissions. The
    Ft. McMurray extraction plant has processing capacity in
    excess of

100 MMcf/d

with the ability to recover in excess of 15 Mbbls/d of
    olefin and NGL products.

Canadian
    olefin expansion projects

In Canada, we expect to begin construction in 2010 on a

261-mile,

12-inch

pipeline which will transport recovered NGLs and olefins from
    our processing plant in Ft. McMurray to our fractionation
    facility near Edmonton, Alberta. The pipeline will have
    sufficient capacity to transport additional NGLs and olefins
    from the current arrangement with the third-party oil sands
    producer, as well as from other oil-sands producers’
    off-gas in the Ft. McMurray area. The project will be
    constructed using cash previously generated from Canadian and
    other international projects. We anticipate an in-service date
    in 2012.

In addition, a project to upgrade the value of one of the
    products produced at the fractionators near Edmonton, Alberta,
    is expected to be completed in the latter part of 2010. The new
    splitter and hydrotreating facilities will take the
    butane/butlyene mix product currently produced and further
    fractionate the mix product into two higher value products that
    are in greater demand in the market place. These new facilities
    are also being constructed using cash generated from Canadian
    and other international projects.

NGL
    and Olefin Marketing Services

In addition to our gathering, processing and olefin production
    operations, we market NGLs and olefin products to a wide range
    of users in the energy and petrochemical industries. The NGL
    marketing business transports and markets equity NGLs from the
    production at our domestic processing plants, and also markets
    NGLs on behalf of third-party NGL producers, including some of
    our fee-based processing customers, and the NGL volumes owned by
    Discovery Producer Services LLC. The NGL marketing business
    bears the risk of price changes in these NGL volumes while they
    are being transported to final sales delivery points. In order
    to meet sales contract obligations, we may purchase products in
    the spot market for resale. The majority of domestic sales are
    based on supply contracts of one year or less in duration. The
    production from our Canadian facilities is marketed in Canada
    and in the United States.

Other

We own interests in

and/or

operate NGL fractionation and storage assets. These assets
    include two partially owned NGL fractionation facilities: one
    near Conway, Kansas and the other in Baton Rouge, Louisiana that
    have a combined capacity in excess of 167 Mbbls/d. We also
    own approximately 20 million barrels of NGL storage
    capacity in central Kansas near Conway.

We own an equity interest in and operate the facilities of
    Discovery Producer Services LLC and its subsidiary Discovery Gas
    Transmission LLC (collectively, Discovery) through our interest
    in WPZ. Discovery’s assets include a

600 MMcf/d

cryogenic natural gas processing plant near Larose, Louisiana, a
    32 Mbbls/d NGL fractionator plant near Paradis, Louisiana
    and an offshore natural gas gathering and transportation system
    in the Gulf of Mexico.

We also own a 14.6 percent equity interest in Aux Sable
    Liquid Products LP and its Channahon, Illinois gas processing
    and NGL fractionation facility near Chicago. The facility is
    capable of processing up to 2.1 Bcf/d of natural gas from
    the Alliance Pipeline system and fractionating approximately
    87 Mbbls/d of extracted liquids into NGL products.

In June 2009, we completed the formation of a new joint venture,
    Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC (Laurel Mountain), in the
    Marcellus Shale located in southwest Pennsylvania. Our partner
    in the venture contributed its existing Appalachian basin
    gathering system, which currently has an average throughput of
    approximately

100 MMcf/d.

In exchange for a 51 percent interest in the venture, we
    contributed $100 million and issued a



$26 million note payable. In 2010, we expect to
    significantly increase our investment in our Laurel Mountain
    joint venture through new gathering system infrastructure
    construction.

In conjunction with a long-term agreement with a major producer,
    we will construct a

28-mile

natural gas gathering pipeline in the Marcellus Shale region
    that will deliver to the Transco pipeline. Construction is
    expected to begin on the

20-inch

pipeline in the latter part of 2010, and it is expected to be
    placed into service during 2011. We will operate the pipeline,
    which represents our second significant midstream expansion in
    the Marcellus Shale.

We own a 49.25 percent interest in Accroven SRL which
    includes two

400 MMcf/d

NGL extraction plants, a 50 Mbbls/d NGL fractionation plant
    and associated storage and refrigeration facilities. Accroven
    owns and operates gas processing facilities and an NGL
    fractionation plant for the exclusive benefit of the state-owned
    oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). As a
    result of deteriorating circumstances for our Venezuelan
    operations (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements), we fully impaired and recognized a $75 million
    charge related to an

other-than-temporary

loss in value of our Accroven investment. (See Note 3 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Accroven was not
    part of the operations that were expropriated by the Venezuelan
    government in May 2009. We are currently engaged in discussions
    regarding the eventual disposition of Accroven.

WPZ

WPZ was formed in 2005 to engage in gathering, transporting,
    processing and treating natural gas and fractionating and
    storing NGLs. As of December 31, 2009, we own approximately
    a 23.6 percent limited partnership interest, including the
    interests of the general partner, Williams Partners GP LLC,
    which is wholly owned by us, and incentive distribution rights.
    WPZ provides us with an alternative source of equity capital.
    WPZ also creates a vehicle to monetize our qualifying assets.
    Such transactions, which are subject to approval by the boards
    of directors of both Williams and WPZ’s general partner,
    allow us to retain control of the assets through our ownership
    interest in WPZ and operation of the assets. As of
    December 31, 2009, WPZ’s asset portfolio includes
    Williams Four Corners LLC, certain ownership interests in
    Wamsutter LLC, a 60 percent interest in Discovery, three
    integrated NGL storage facilities near Conway, Kansas, a
    50 percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway,
    Kansas, and the Carbonate Trend sour gas gathering pipeline off
    the coast of Alabama.

As previously discussed, our ownership in WPZ, WPZ’s asset
    portfolio, and our future segment reporting structure were
    affected by our 2010 restructuring transactions.

Gas
    Marketing Services

Gas Marketing primarily supports our natural gas businesses by
    providing marketing and risk management services, which include
    marketing and hedging the gas produced by
    Exploration & Production and procuring the



majority of fuel and shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids
    sales for Midstream. Gas Marketing also provides similar
    services to third parties, such as producers and natural gas
    processors. In addition, Gas Marketing manages various natural
    gas-related contracts such as transportation and storage along
    with the related hedges, including certain legacy natural gas
    contracts and positions.

Gas Marketing’s 2009 natural gas purchase volumes include
    1.4 Bcf/d of gas produced by Exploration &
    Production and another 1.0 Bcf/d from other sources. This
    natural gas was in turn marketed and sold to third parties
    (2.1 Bcf/d) and to Midstream (0.3 Bcf/d).

Our Exploration & Production and Midstream segments
    may execute commodity hedges with Gas Marketing. In turn, Gas
    Marketing may execute offsetting derivative contracts with
    unrelated third parties.

Additional
    Business Segment Information

Our ongoing business segments are accounted for as continuing
    operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes to
    financial statements included in Part II.

Operations related to certain assets in “Discontinued
    Operations” have been reclassified from their traditional
    business segment to “Discontinued Operations” in the
    accompanying financial statements and notes to financial
    statements included in Part II.

We perform certain management, legal, financial, tax,
    consultation, information technology, administrative and other
    services for our subsidiaries.

Our principal sources of cash are from dividends and advances
    from our subsidiaries, investments, payments by subsidiaries for
    services rendered, interest payments from subsidiaries on cash
    advances and, if needed, external financings, sales of master
    limited partnership units to the public, and net proceeds from
    asset sales. The amount of dividends available to us from
    subsidiaries largely depends upon each subsidiary’s
    earnings and operating capital requirements. The terms of
    certain of our subsidiaries’ borrowing arrangements limit
    the transfer of funds to us.

We believe that we have adequate sources and availability of raw
    materials and commodities for existing and anticipated business
    needs. In support of our energy commodity activities, primarily
    conducted through Gas Marketing Services, our counterparties
    require us to provide various forms of credit support such as
    margin, adequate assurance amounts and pre-payments for gas
    supplies. Our pipeline systems are all regulated in various ways
    resulting in the financial return on the investments made in the
    systems being limited to standards permitted by the regulatory
    agencies. Each of the pipeline systems has ongoing capital
    requirements for efficiency and mandatory improvements, with
    expansion opportunities also necessitating periodic capital
    outlays.

REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Exploration & Production.

Our
    Exploration & Production business is subject to
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations on
    taxation and payment of royalties, and the development,
    production and marketing of oil and gas, and environmental and
    safety matters. Many laws and regulations require drilling
    permits and govern the spacing of wells, rates of production,
    water discharge, prevention of waste and other matters. Such
    laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning,
    designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning our
    oil and gas wells and other facilities. In addition, these laws
    and regulations, and any others that are passed by the
    jurisdictions where we have production, could limit the total
    number of wells drilled or the allowable production from
    successful wells, which could limit our reserves.

Gas Pipeline.

Gas Pipeline’s interstate
    transmission and storage activities are subject to FERC
    regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and under the
    Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as such, its rates and
    charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate
    commerce, its accounting, and the extension, enlargement or
    abandonment of its jurisdictional facilities, among other
    things, are subject to regulation. Each gas pipeline company
    holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by
    the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines,
    facilities and properties for which certificates are required
    under the NGA. Each gas pipeline company is also subject to the
    Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, and the
    Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, which regulates safety
    requirements in the design, construction, operation and



maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities.
    FERC Standards of Conduct govern how our interstate pipelines
    communicate and do business with gas marketing employees. Among
    other things, the Standards of Conduct require that interstate
    pipelines not operate their systems to preferentially benefit
    gas marketing functions.

Each of our interstate natural gas pipeline companies
    establishes its rates primarily through the FERC’s
    ratemaking process. Key determinants in the ratemaking process
    are:

•

Costs of providing service, including depreciation expense;

•

Allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the
    capital structure and related income taxes;

•

Volume throughput assumptions.

The allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate
    design and the allocation of costs between the demand and
    commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these
    proceedings, certain revenues previously collected may be
    subject to refund.

Pipeline
    Integrity Regulations

Transco and Northwest Pipeline have developed Integrity
    Management Plans that meet the United States Department of
    Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
    Administration (“PHMSA”) final rule pursuant to the
    requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. In
    meeting the integrity regulations, Transco and Northwest
    Pipeline have identified high-consequence areas, completed
    baseline assessment plans, and are on schedule to complete the
    required assessments within specified timeframes. Currently,
    Transco and Northwest Pipeline estimate that the cost to perform
    required assessments and remediation will be primarily capital
    and range between $150 million and $220 million and
    between $65 million and $85 million, respectively,
    over the remaining assessment period of 2010 through 2012.
    Management considers the costs associated with compliance with
    the rule to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of
    business and, therefore, recoverable through rates.

Midstream Gas & Liquids.

For our
    Midstream segment, onshore gathering is subject to regulation by
    states in which we operate and offshore gathering is subject to
    the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). Of the states
    where Midstream gathers gas, currently only Texas actively
    regulates gathering activities. Texas regulates gathering
    primarily through complaint mechanisms under which the state
    commission may resolve disputes involving an individual
    gathering arrangement. Although offshore gathering facilities
    are not subject to the NGA, offshore transmission pipelines are
    subject to the NGA, and in recent years the FERC has taken a
    broad view of offshore transmission, finding many shallow-water
    pipelines to be jurisdictional transmission. Most gathering
    facilities offshore are subject to the OCSLA, which provides in
    part that outer continental shelf pipelines “must provide
    open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and nonowner
    shippers.”

Midstream also owns interests in and operates two offshore
    transmission pipelines that are regulated by the FERC because
    they are deemed to transport gas in interstate commerce. Black
    Marlin Pipeline Company provides transportation service for
    offshore Texas production in the High Island area and redelivers
    that gas to intrastate pipeline interconnects near Texas City.
    Discovery provides transportation service for offshore Louisiana
    production from the South Timbalier, Grand Isle, Ewing Bank and
    Green Canyon (deepwater) areas to an onshore processing facility
    and downstream interconnect points with major interstate
    pipelines. FERC regulation requires all terms and conditions of
    service, including the rates charged, to be filed with and
    approved by the FERC before any changes can go into effect.

Our Midstream Canadian assets are regulated by the Energy
    Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) and Alberta Environment. The
    regulatory system for the Alberta oil and gas industry
    incorporates a large measure of self-regulation, providing that
    licensed operators are held responsible for ensuring that their
    operations are conducted in accordance with all provincial
    regulatory requirements. For situations in which noncompliance
    with the applicable regulations is at issue, the ERCB and
    Alberta Environment have implemented an enforcement process with
    escalating consequences.

Gas Marketing Services.

Our Gas Marketing
    business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations at the
    local, state and federal levels, including the FERC and the
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations. In



addition, natural gas markets continue to be subject to numerous
    and wide-ranging federal and state regulatory proceedings and
    investigations. We are also subject to various federal and state
    actions and investigations regarding, among other things, market
    structure, behavior of market participants, market prices, and
    reporting to trade publications. We may be liable for refunds
    and other damages and penalties as a result of ongoing actions
    and investigations. The outcome of these matters could affect
    our creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual
    obligations as well as other market participants’
    creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual obligations
    to us.

See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further details on our regulatory matters.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Our generation facilities, processing facilities, natural gas
    pipelines, and exploration and production operations are subject
    to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the
    state and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We could incur liability to
    governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil,
    gas or other pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as
    liability for cleanup costs. Materials could be released into
    the environment in several ways including, but not limited to:

•

From a well or drilling equipment at a drill site;

•

Leakage from gathering systems, pipelines, processing or
    treating facilities, transportation facilities and storage tanks;

•

Damage to oil and gas wells resulting from accidents during
    normal operations;

•

Blowouts, cratering and explosions.

Because the requirements imposed by environmental laws and
    regulations are frequently changed, we cannot assure you that
    laws and regulations enacted in the future, including changes to
    existing laws and regulations, will not adversely affect our
    business. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damage
    caused by former operators of our properties.

We believe compliance with environmental laws and regulations
    will not have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures,
    earnings or competitive position. However, environmental laws
    and regulations could affect our business in various ways from
    time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance
    expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek
    relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of
    certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance
    expenses.

For a discussion of specific environmental issues, see
    “Environmental” under Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
    “Environmental Matters” in Note 16 of our Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.

COMPETITION

Exploration & Production.

Our
    Exploration & Production segment competes with other
    oil and gas concerns, including major and independent oil and
    gas companies in the development, production and marketing of
    natural gas. We compete in areas such as acquisition of oil and
    gas properties and obtaining necessary equipment, supplies and
    services. We also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled
    employees.

Gas Pipeline.

The natural gas industry has
    undergone significant change over the past two decades. A
    highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and
    increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services,
    including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity,
    have developed. As a result, pipeline capacity is being used
    more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are
    increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity.

Local distribution company (LDC) and electric industry
    restructuring by states have affected pipeline markets. Pipeline
    operators are increasingly challenged to accommodate the
    flexibility demanded by customers and allowed



under tariffs, but the changes implemented at the state level
    have not required renegotiation of LDC contracts. The state
    plans have in some cases discouraged LDCs from signing long-term
    contracts for new capacity.

States are in the process of developing new energy plans that
    may require utilities to encourage energy saving measures and
    diversify their energy supplies to include renewable sources.
    This could lower the growth of gas demand.

These factors have increased the risk that customers will reduce
    their contractual commitments for pipeline capacity. Future
    utilization of pipeline capacity will also depend on competition
    from LNG imported into markets and new pipelines from the
    Rockies and other new producing areas, many of which are
    utilizing master limited partnership structures with a lower
    cost of capital, and on growth of natural gas demand.

Midstream Gas & Liquids.

In our
    Midstream segment, we face regional competition with varying
    competitive factors in each basin. Our gathering and processing
    business competes with other midstream companies, interstate and
    intrastate pipelines, producers and independent gatherers and
    processors. We primarily compete with five to ten companies
    across all basins in which we provide services. Numerous factors
    impact any given customer’s choice of a gathering or
    processing services provider, including rate, location, term,
    timeliness of services to be provided, pressure obligations and
    contract structure. We also compete in recruiting and retaining
    skilled employees. By virtue of the master limited partnership
    structure, WPZ provides us with an alternative source of
    capital, which helps us compete against other master limited
    partnerships for midstream projects.

Gas Marketing Services.

In our Gas Marketing
    Services segment, we compete directly with large independent
    energy marketers, marketing affiliates of regulated pipelines
    and utilities, and natural gas producers. We also compete with
    brokerage houses, energy hedge funds and other energy-based
    companies offering similar services.

EMPLOYEES

At February 1, 2010, we had approximately
    4,801 full-time employees. None of our employees are
    represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining
    agreements.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS/RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

FOR PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain matters contained in this report include
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended. These forward-looking statements relate to anticipated
    financial performance, management’s plans and objectives
    for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory
    proceedings, market conditions and other matters. We make these
    forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor
    protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts,
    included in this report that address activities, events or
    developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or
    may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements.
    Forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of
    words such as “anticipates,” “believes,”
    “seeks,” “could,” “may,”
    “should,” “continues,”
    “estimates,” “expects,”
    “forecasts,” “intends,” “might,”



“goals,” “objectives,” “targets,”
    “planned,” “potential,”
    “projects,” “scheduled,” “will” or
    other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are
    based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on
    information currently available to management and include, among
    others, statements regarding:

•

Amounts and nature of future capital expenditures;

•

Expansion and growth of our business and operations;

•

Financial condition and liquidity;

•

Business strategy;

•

Estimates of proved gas and oil reserves;

•

Reserve potential;

•

Development drilling potential;

•

Cash flow from operations or results of operations;

•

Seasonality of certain business segments;

•

Natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and demand.

Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions,
    uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or
    results to be materially different from those stated or implied
    in this report. Many of the factors that will determine these
    results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Specific
    factors that could cause actual results to differ from results
    contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among
    others, the following:

•

Availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent
    in assessing, estimating, acquiring and developing future
    natural gas reserves), market demand, volatility of prices, and
    the availability and cost of capital;

•

Inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and
    general economic conditions (including future disruptions and
    volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these
    events on our customers and suppliers);

•

The strength and financial resources of our competitors;

•

Development of alternative energy sources;

•

The impact of operational and development hazards;

•

Costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government
    regulations (including proposed climate change legislation),
    environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings;

•

Our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension
    plans and other postretirement benefit plans;

•

Changes in maintenance and construction costs;

•

Changes in the current geopolitical situation;

•

Our exposure to the credit risk of our customers;

•

Risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions
    stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit
    ratings and the availability and cost of credit;

•

Risks associated with future weather conditions;

•

Acts of terrorism;

•

Additional risks described in our filings with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission.

Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
    forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly
    rely on our forward-looking



statements. We disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to
    update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any
    revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect
    future events or developments.

In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors
    listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to
    change from those statements of intention set forth in this
    report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our
    results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and
    without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our
    assumptions, or otherwise.

Because forward-looking statements involve risks and
    uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in
    addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to
    differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
    statements. These factors are described in the following section.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in
    addition to the other information in this report. Each of these
    factors could adversely affect our business, operating results,
    and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value
    of an investment in our securities.

Risks
    Related to the Restructuring

We did
    not seek a vote of our shareholders in connection with the
    restructuring. If there is a determination that such a vote was
    required, the resulting consequences could impact
    us.

Section 271 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
    “DGCL”) generally requires a corporation to obtain
    authorization from the holders of a majority of its outstanding
    shares if the corporation intends to sell all or substantially
    all of its assets. We do not believe the restructuring
    constituted a sale of “all or substantially all” of
    our assets because of, among other things, the portion of our
    assets involved, the significance of our assets and businesses
    that were not transferred and the facts that we retain control
    of all of the assets involved and over an 80% interest in the
    cash flows therefrom. As such, we did not seek a vote of our
    shareholders in connection with the restructuring. There is a
    limited body of Delaware case law interpreting the phrase
    “all or substantially all,” and there is no precise
    established definition. We cannot assure you that the
    restructuring did not constitute a sale of “all or
    substantially all” of our assets and, therefore, that a
    shareholder vote was not required. If such a shareholder vote
    were determined to be required, the resulting consequences could
    impact us and could include (among other consequences) our
    shareholders asserting claims against us, some or all of which
    could ultimately be successful.

We may
    not realize the anticipated benefits from the
    restructuring.

We may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from the
    Dropdown for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to,
    if any of the matters identified as risks in this Risk Factors
    section were to occur. If we do not realize the anticipated
    benefits from the restructuring for any reason, our business may
    be materially adversely affected.

Risks
    Inherent to our Industry and Business

The
    long-term financial condition of our Gas Pipeline and Midstream
    businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural
    gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for
    those supplies in our traditional markets, and the prices of and
    market demand for natural gas.

The development of the additional natural gas reserves that are
    essential for our Gas Pipeline and Midstream businesses to
    thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for
    exploration and development drilling and the installation of
    production, gathering, storage, transportation and other
    facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered
    to our pipeline systems. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory
    limitations, including environmental regulations, or the lack of
    available capital for these projects could adversely affect the
    development and production of additional reserves, as well as
    gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and
    export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability
    to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and
    processing facilities.



Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins
    with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will also
    naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves
    underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and
    the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be
    greater than anticipated. Additionally, the competition for
    natural gas supplies to serve other markets could reduce the
    amount of natural gas supply for our customers. Accordingly, to
    maintain or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of
    natural gas transported on or gathered through our pipelines and
    cash flows associated with the gathering and transportation of
    natural gas, our customers must compete with others to obtain
    adequate supplies of natural gas. In addition, if natural gas
    prices in the supply basins connected to our pipeline systems
    are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions,
    our ability to compete with other transporters may be negatively
    impacted on a short-term basis, as well as with respect to our
    long-term recontracting activities. If new supplies of natural
    gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes
    from existing supply areas, if natural gas supplies are diverted
    to serve other markets, or if environmental regulators restrict
    new natural gas drilling, the overall volume of natural gas
    transported, gathered, and stored on our system would decline,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new
    LNG import facilities built near our markets could result in
    less demand for our gathering and transportation facilities.

Significant
    prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and
    demand and cause a termination of our transportation and storage
    contracts or a reduction in throughput on our
    system.

Higher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a
    decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in our
    long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on
    our Gas Pipelines’ systems. Also, lower natural gas prices
    over the long term could result in a decline in the production
    of natural gas resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on
    our Gas Pipelines’ systems. As a result, significant
    prolonged changes in natural gas prices could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Prices
    for NGLs, natural gas and other commodities are volatile and
    this volatility could adversely affect our financial results,
    cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain existing
    businesses.

Our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the
    value of certain segments of our businesses depend primarily
    upon the prices of NGLs, natural gas, or other commodities, and
    the differences between prices of these commodities. Price
    volatility and relative price levels may impact both the amount
    we receive for our products and services and the volume of
    products and services we sell. Prices affect the amount of cash
    flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to
    borrow money or raise additional capital.

The markets for NGLs, natural gas and other commodities are
    likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices
    might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and
    demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other
    factors that are beyond our control, including:

•

Worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas,
    NGLs, petroleum, and related commodities;

•

Turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions;

•

The activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
    Countries;

•

Terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets;

•

Weather conditions;

•

The level of consumer demand;

•

The price and availability of other types of fuels;

•

The availability of pipeline capacity;

•

Supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation
    disruptions;

•

The price and level of foreign imports;



•

Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;

•

Volatility in the natural gas markets;

•

The overall economic environment;

•

The credit of participants in the markets where products are
    bought and sold;

•

The adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate
    change.

We
    might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated
    with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy
    markets.

Our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may
    consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities,
    including contracts for natural gas, NGLs and other commodities
    that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash
    throughout the United States. If the values of these contracts
    change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or
    cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of
    operations. In the past, certain marketing and trading companies
    have experienced severe financial problems due to price
    volatility in the energy commodity markets. In certain instances
    this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver
    energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. If
    such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts,
    we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if
    any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. In
    addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our
    counterparties. Despite performing credit analysis prior to
    extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not
    be able to collect amounts owed to us. If the counterparty to
    such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that
    secures our counterparty’s obligation is inadequate, we
    will suffer a loss. A general downturn in the economy and
    tightening of global credit markets could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform than we have expected.

Significant
    capital expenditures are required to replace our
    reserves.

Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require
    substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded
    our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows
    from operations and debt and equity issuances. Future cash flows
    are subject to a number of variables, including the level of
    production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, and our
    success in developing and producing new reserves. If our cash
    flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital
    expenditure budget, we may not be able to access additional bank
    debt, issue debt or equity securities or access other methods of
    financing on an economic basis to meet our capital expenditure
    budget. As a result, our capital expenditure plans may have to
    be adjusted.

Failure
    to replace reserves may negatively affect our
    business.

The growth of our Exploration & Production business
    depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional
    natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our
    proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced,
    unless we conduct successful exploration or development
    activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or
    both. We may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional
    reserves on an economic basis. If natural gas prices increase,
    our costs for additional reserves would also increase;
    conversely if natural gas prices decrease, it could make it more
    difficult to fund the replacement of our reserves.

Exploration
    and development drilling may not result in commercially
    productive reserves.

Our past success rate for drilling projects should not be
    considered a predictor of future commercial success. We do not
    always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our
    drilling operations. The new wells we drill or participate in
    may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion
    of our investment in wells we drill or participate in. The cost
    of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain,
    and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a
    project. Our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry wells
    or wells that are



productive but do not produce enough reserves to return a profit
    after drilling, operating and other costs. Further, our drilling
    operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of
    a variety of factors, including:

•

Increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
    availability of, drilling rigs and equipment, skilled labor,
    capital or transportation;

•

Unexpected drilling conditions or problems;

•

Regulations and regulatory approvals;

•

Changes or anticipated changes in energy prices;

•

Compliance with environmental and other governmental
    requirements.

Estimating
    reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties.
    Negative revisions to reserve estimates, oil and gas prices or
    assumptions as to future natural gas prices may lead to
    decreased earnings, losses, or impairment of oil and gas assets,
    including related goodwill.

Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating
    underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured
    in an exact manner. Reserves that are “proved
    reserves” are those estimated quantities of crude oil,
    natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and
    engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered
    as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects.

The process relies on interpretations of available geological,
    geophysical, engineering and production data. There are numerous
    uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved
    reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing
    of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the
    control of the producer. The reserve data included in this
    report represent estimates. In addition, the estimates of future
    net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of
    such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future
    production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be
    correct.

Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic
    conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Changes
    to oil and gas prices in the markets for such commodities may
    have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain
    fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable
    reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve
    estimates.

If negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing
    the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the
    affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in
    losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense. These revisions, as well as revisions in the
    assumptions of future cash flows of these reserves, may also be
    sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties
    which would result in a noncash charge to earnings. The
    revisions could also possibly affect the evaluation of
    Exploration & Production’s goodwill for
    impairment purposes. At December 31, 2009, we had
    approximately $1 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet.

Certain
    of our services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts
    that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform
    such services exceeds the revenues received from such
    contracts.

Our Gas Pipeline and Midstream businesses provide some services
    pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. It is possible
    that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed
    the revenues we collect for our services. Although most of the
    services provided by our interstate gas pipelines are priced at
    cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases,
    under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer
    may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a
    “negotiated rate” that may be above or below the FERC
    regulated cost-based rate for that service. These
    “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject
    to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by
    inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities
    being used to perform the services.



We may
    not be able to maintain or replace expiring natural gas
    transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates or on a
    long-term basis.

Our primary exposure to market risk for our Gas Pipelines occurs
    at the time the terms of their existing transportation and
    storage contracts expire and are subject to termination.
    Although none of our Gas Pipelines’ material contracts are
    terminable in 2010, upon expiration of the terms we may not be
    able to extend contracts with existing customers to obtain
    replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term
    basis. The extension or replacement of existing contracts
    depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:

•

The level of existing and new competition to deliver natural gas
    to our markets;

•

The growth in demand for natural gas in our markets;

•

Whether the market will continue to support long-term firm
    contracts;

•

Whether our business strategy continues to be successful;

•

The level of competition for natural gas supplies in the
    production basins serving us;

•

The effects of state regulation on customer contracting
    practices.

Any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our
    existing contracts may have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Our
    risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective
    and could increase the volatility of our results.

Although we have systems in place that use various methodologies
    to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses,
    these systems might not always be followed or might not always
    be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage
    risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse
    changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse
    correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets,
    changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this
    report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and
    balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks
    have been identified.

In an effort to manage our financial exposure related to
    commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into
    contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and
    operations. In these hedging activities, we have used
    fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts,
    futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the

over-the-counter

markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no single hedging
    arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given
    contract. For example, a forward contract that would be
    effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not
    hedge the contract’s counterparty credit or performance
    risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist.
    While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within
    guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able
    to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash
    flows and results of operations could be impacted by
    counterparty default.

Our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to
    reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity
    markets could result in increased volatility of our reported
    results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of
    derivatives that qualify as hedges under GAAP to the extent that
    such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the
    value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair
    value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been
    designated as hedges under GAAP, must be recorded in our income.
    This creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no
    economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period.

The impact of changes in market prices for NGLs and natural gas
    on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced
    based on the level of our hedging activities. These hedging
    arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market
    prices for NGLs or natural gas were to change substantially from
    the price established by the hedges. In addition, our hedging
    arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain
    circumstances, including instances in which:

•

Volumes are less than expected;

•

The hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating
    the risk being hedged;

•

The counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor
    their financial commitments.



We
    depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our
    revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of
    any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our
    business.

Our Gas Pipeline and Midstream businesses rely on a limited
    number of customers for a significant portion of their revenues.
    Although some of these customers are subject to long-term
    contracts, extensions or replacements of these contracts may not
    be renegotiated favorable terms, if at all. The loss of even a
    portion of the revenues from natural gas, NGLs or contracted
    volumes, as applicable, supplied by these customers, as a result
    of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate
    extensions or replacements of contracts or otherwise, could have
    a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows, unless we are able to
    generate comparable revenues from other sources.

We are
    exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and our credit risk
    management may not be adequate to protect against such
    risk.

We are exposed to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment

and/or

nonperformance by our customers in the ordinary course of our
    business. Generally our customers are either rated investment
    grade or otherwise considered credit worthy, or they are
    required to make pre-payments or otherwise provide security to
    satisfy credit concerns. However, our credit procedures and
    policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit
    risk. We cannot predict to what extent our business would be
    impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including
    declines in our customers’ creditworthiness. If we fail to
    adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future
    customers, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness
    and any resulting increase in nonpayment

and/or

nonperformance by them could cause us to write-down or write-off
    doubtful accounts. Such write-downs or write-offs could
    negatively affect our operating results for the period in which
    they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and
    financial condition.

Competition
    in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our
    results of operations.

We have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses,
    and additional competitors may enter our markets. Other
    companies with which we compete may be able to respond more
    quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or
    to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their facilities than we can. In addition,
    current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions
    or have greater financial resources than we do, which could
    affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. There
    can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully
    against current and future competitors and any failure to do so
    could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and
    results of operations.

The
    failure of new sources of natural gas production or LNG import
    terminals to be successfully developed in North America could
    increase natural gas prices and reduce the demand for our
    services.

New sources of natural gas production in the United States and
    Canada, particularly in areas of shale development are expected
    to become an increasingly significant component of future U.S.
    natural gas supplies in North America. Additionally, increases
    in LNG supplies are expected to be imported through new LNG
    import terminals, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. If
    these additional sources of supply are not developed, natural
    gas prices could increase and cause consumers of natural gas to
    turn to alternative energy sources, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Our
    drilling, production, gathering, processing, storage and
    transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result
    in accidents, and other operating risks and
    hazards.

Our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards
    typically associated with the development and exploration for,
    and the production and transportation of oil and gas. These
    operating risks include, but are not limited to:

•

Fires, blowouts, cratering and explosions;

•

Uncontrolled releases of oil, natural gas, NGLs or well fluids;

•

Collapse of NGL storage caverns;



•

Operator error;

•

Pollution and other environmental risks;

•

Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions
    and other natural disasters;

•

Aging infrastructure and mechanical problems;

•

Damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages;

•

Damage inadvertently caused by third party activity, such as
    operation of construction equipment;

•

Risks related to truck and rail loading and unloading;

•

Risks related to operating in a marine environment;

•

Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or
    those of other energy companies.

Any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal
    injuries, significant damage to property, environmental
    pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses
    to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we
    maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and
    losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. The
    location of certain segments of our pipelines in or near
    populated areas, including residential areas, commercial
    business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level
    of damages resulting from these risks. In spite of our
    precautions, an event such as those described above could cause
    considerable harm to people or property, and could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by
    insurance. Accidents or other operating risks could further
    result in loss of service available to our customers. Such
    circumstances, including those arising from maintenance and
    repair activities, could result in service interruptions on
    segments of our pipeline infrastructure. Potential customer
    impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of our
    pipeline infrastructure could include limitations on the
    pipeline’s ability to satisfy customer requirements,
    obligations to provide reservations charge credits to customers
    in times of constrained capacity, and solicitation of existing
    customers by others for potential new pipeline projects that
    would compete directly with existing services. Such
    circumstances could materially impact our ability to meet
    contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting
    negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We do
    not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously
    harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the ability of the
    insurers we do use to satisfy our claims.

We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our
    business, including environmental accidents that might occur. In
    addition, we do not maintain business interruption insurance in
    the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. We
    currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of
    $610 million per occurrence and in the aggregate annually
    and a deductible of $2 million per occurrence. This
    insurance covers us, our subsidiaries and certain of our
    affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of
    bodily injury, personal injury or property damage, including
    resulting loss of use to third parties. This excess liability
    insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution
    liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of
    insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage
    for natural gas and NGL operations. Pollution liability coverage
    excludes: release of pollutants subsequent to their disposal;
    release of substances arising from the combustion of fuels that
    result in acidic deposition, and testing, monitoring,

clean-up,

containment, treatment or removal of pollutants from property
    owned, occupied by, rented to, used by or in the care, custody
    or control of us, our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates.

We do not insure onshore underground pipelines for physical
    damage, except at river crossings and at certain locations such
    as compressor stations. We maintain coverage of
    $300 million per occurrence for physical damage to onshore
    assets and resulting business interruption caused by terrorist
    acts. We also maintain coverage of $100 million per
    occurrence for physical damage to offshore assets caused by
    terrorist acts, except for our Devils Tower spar where we
    maintain limits of $300 million per occurrence for property
    damage caused by terrorist acts and $105 million per
    occurrence for resulting business interruption. Also, all of our
    insurance is subject to deductibles. If a significant accident
    or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could
    adversely affect our



operations and financial condition. We may not be able to
    maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at
    reasonable rates. Changes in the insurance markets subsequent to
    hurricane losses in recent years have impacted named windstorm
    insurance coverage, rates and availability for Gulf of Mexico
    area exposures, and we may elect to self insure a portion of our
    asset portfolio. We cannot assure you that we will in the future
    be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would
    otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes or that
    the insurance coverage we do obtain will not contain large
    deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all
    potential losses. The occurrence of any operating risks not
    fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows.

In addition, certain insurance companies that provide coverage
    to us, including American International Group, Inc., have
    experienced negative developments that could impair their
    ability to pay any of our potential claims. As a result, we
    could be exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have
    to obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost.

Execution
    of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks,
    increases in labor and materials costs and other risks that may
    adversely affect financial results.

A significant portion of any growth in our Gas Pipeline and
    Midstream businesses is accomplished through the construction of
    new pipelines, processing and storage facilities, as well as the
    expansion of existing facilities. Construction of these
    facilities is subject to various regulatory, development and
    operational risks, including:

•

The ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by
    regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;

•

The availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to
    complete expansion projects;

•

Potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and
    regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent
    a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of
    the project;

•

Impediments on our ability to acquire

rights-of-way

or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;

•

The ability to construct projects within estimated costs,
    including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or
    increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, or other factors
    beyond our control, that may be material;

•

The ability to access capital markets to fund construction
    projects.

Any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding,
    delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. As a
    result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment
    return, which could adversely affect results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Our
    costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension
    plans and costs for our other post-retirement benefit plans are
    affected by factors beyond our control.

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all
    of our U.S. employees and other post-retirement benefit
    plans covering certain eligible participants. The timing and
    amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit
    pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control,
    including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors
    outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates
    and changes in pension laws. Changes to these and other factors
    that can significantly increase our funding requirements could
    have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

Two of
    our subsidiaries act as the respective general partners of two
    different publicly-traded limited partnerships, Williams
    Partners L.P. and Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. As such, those
    subsidiaries’ operations may involve a greater risk of
    liability than ordinary business operations.

One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of WPZ and
    another subsidiary of ours acts as the general partner of WMZ.
    Each of these subsidiaries that act as the general partner of a
    publicly-traded limited partnership



may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with
    respect to the limited partnership of which it serves as the
    general partner and to the limited partners of such limited
    partnership. Activities determined to involve fiduciary
    obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a
    higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and
    therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly
    when a conflict of interests is found to exist. Our control of
    the general partners of two different publicly traded
    partnerships may increase the possibility of claims of breach of
    fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of
    interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise
    (i) between the two publicly-traded partnerships as well as
    (ii) between a publicly-traded partnership, on the one
    hand, and its general partner and that general partner’s
    affiliates, including us, on the other hand). Any liability
    resulting from such claims could be material.

Potential
    changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our
    financial results and disclosures in the future, which might
    change the way analysts measure our business or financial
    performance.

Regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at
    accounting practices, financial disclosures, companies’
    relationships with their independent registered public
    accounting firms, and retirement plan practices. We cannot
    predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting
    regulations or practices in general with respect to public
    companies or the energy industry or in our operations
    specifically. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) or the SEC could enact new accounting standards
    that might impact how we are required to record revenues,
    expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Any significant change
    in accounting standards or disclosure requirements could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
    and financial condition.

Our
    investments and projects located outside of the United States
    expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and
    the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates,
    political conditions and policies of foreign governments. These
    risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our
    international projects.

We currently own and might acquire

and/or

dispose of material energy-related investments and projects
    outside the United States. The economic and political conditions
    in certain countries where we have interests or in which we
    might explore development, acquisition or investment
    opportunities present risks of delays in construction and
    interruption of business, as well as risks of war,
    expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions
    or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax
    policy, that are greater than in the United States. The
    uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign
    countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make
    investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse
    project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could
    adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their
    obligations with respect to such projects or investments and
    could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements
    relating to such projects or investments.

Operations and investments in foreign countries also can present
    currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and
    repatriation risk. In certain situations under which we develop
    or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary
    conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert
    to U.S. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign
    currencies. In addition, risk from fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or
    borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in
    another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can
    reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service
    obligations. We may or may not put contracts in place designed
    to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. We have some
    exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses
    or volatility in our results of operations.

Our
    operating results for certain segments of our business might
    fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.

Revenues from certain segments of our business can have seasonal
    characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for
    natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a
    result, our overall operating results in the future might
    fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural
    gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our
    expectations depending on the nature and location of our
    facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas
    transportation arrangements relative to demand created by
    unusual weather patterns.



Additionally, changes in the price of natural gas could benefit
    one of our business units, but disadvantage another. For
    example, our Exploration & Production business may
    benefit from higher natural gas prices, and Midstream, which
    uses gas as a feedstock, may not.

Risks
    Related to Strategy and Financing

Our
    debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely
    affect our ability to operate our business.

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict
    or limit, among other things, our ability to create liens
    supporting indebtedness, merge, sell substantially all of our
    assets, make certain distributions, and incur additional debt.
    In addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter
    into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other
    limitations with which we will need to comply. These covenants
    could adversely affect our ability to finance our future
    operations or capital needs or engage in, expand or pursue our
    business activities and prevent us from engaging in certain
    transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to
    us. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected
    by many events beyond our control, including prevailing
    economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other
    economic conditions deteriorate, our current assumptions about
    future economic conditions turn out to be incorrect or
    unexpected events occur, our ability to comply with these
    covenants may be significantly impaired. We cannot assure you
    that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply
    with the covenants or, in the event of a default under any of
    our debt agreements, to remedy that default.

Our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements
    could result in events of default. Upon the occurrence of such
    an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all
    amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be
    immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if
    any, to extend further credit. Certain payment defaults or an
    acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a
    cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement.
    Such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider
    impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a
    default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If an event
    of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default,
    and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate
    the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we
    may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding
    under such debt agreements.

Our ability to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt
    obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on
    our operating performance, which will be affected by general
    economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory,
    business and other factors, many of which are beyond our
    control. Our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or
    obtain future credit will also depend upon the current
    conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit
    generally. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations
    or obtain future credit on favorable terms, if at all, we could
    be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek
    additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to
    obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.

Future
    disruptions in the global credit markets may make equity and
    debt markets less accessible, create a shortage in the
    availability of credit and lead to credit market
    volatility.

In 2008, public equity markets experienced significant declines
    and global credit markets experienced a shortage in overall
    liquidity and a resulting disruption in the availability of
    credit. Future disruptions in the global financial marketplace,
    including the bankruptcy or restructuring of financial
    institutions, may make equity and debt markets inaccessible and
    adversely affect the availability of credit already arranged and
    the availability and cost of credit in the future. We have
    availability under our existing bank credit facilities, but our
    ability to borrow under those facilities could be impaired if
    one or more of our lenders fail to honor its contractual
    obligation to lend to us.

Adverse
    economic conditions could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

A slowdown in the economy has the potential to negatively impact
    our businesses in many ways. Included among these potential
    negative impacts are reduced demand and lower prices for our
    products and services, increased difficulty in collecting
    amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction in our
    credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or the
    negative impacts described above), which could result in
    reducing our access to credit markets, raising the cost of such
    access or requiring us to provide additional collateral to our
    counterparties.



A
    downgrade of our credit ratings could impact our liquidity,
    access to capital and our costs of doing business, and
    maintaining current credit ratings is under the control of
    independent third parties.

A downgrade of our credit rating might increase our cost of
    borrowing and would require us to post additional collateral
    with third parties, negatively impacting our available
    liquidity. Our ability to access capital markets would also be
    limited by a downgrade of our credit rating and other
    disruptions. Such disruptions could include:

•

Economic downturns;

•

Deteriorating capital market conditions;

•

Declining market prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and
    other commodities;

•

Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or
    those of other energy companies;

•

The overall health of the energy industry, including the
    bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies.

Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when
    assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of
    criteria including, but not limited to, business composition,
    market and operational risks, as well as various financial
    tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria
    for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make
    changes to those criteria from time to time. Our corporate
    family credit rating and the credit ratings of Transco and
    Northwest Pipeline are rated investment grade by
    Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Corporation, and
    Fitch Ratings, Ltd., and our senior unsecured debt ratings are
    rated investment grade by Moody’s and Fitch. Credit ratings
    are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold investments in the
    rated entity. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at
    any time by the ratings agencies, and no assurance can be given
    that the credit rating agencies will continue to assign us
    investment grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their
    criteria for investment grade ratios or that our senior
    unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade by all
    of the credit rating agencies.

Risks
    Related to Regulations that Affect our Industry

Our
    natural gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are
    subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that
    could have an adverse impact on our results of
    operations.

Our interstate natural gas sales, transportation, and storage
    operations conducted through our Gas Pipelines business are
    subject to the FERC’s rules and regulations in accordance
    with the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The
    FERC’s regulatory authority extends to:

•

Transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate
    commerce;

•

Rates, operating terms and conditions of service, including
    initiation and discontinuation of services;

•

Certification and construction of new facilities;

•

Acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities;

•

Accounts and records;

•

Depreciation and amortization policies;

•

Relationships with marketing functions within Williams involved
    in certain aspects of the natural gas business;

•

Market manipulation in connection with interstate sales,
    purchases or transportation of natural gas.

Regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in
    many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues,
    decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and
    otherwise altering the profitability of our business. Regulatory
    decisions could also affect our costs for compression,
    processing and dehydration of natural gas, which could have a
    negative effect on our results of operations.

The FERC has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces
    in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased
    competition throughout the industry. In a number of key markets,
    interstate pipelines are now facing



competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling
    local distribution companies and end users to choose a
    transportation provider based on considerations other than
    location.

We are
    subject to risks associated with climate change.

There is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases
    (GHGs) may be linked to climate change. Climate change and the
    costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation
    of GHGs have the potential to affect our business in many ways,
    including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing
    our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our
    products and services (due to change in both costs and weather
    patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we
    operate, all of which can create financial risks.

Costs
    of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and
    future environmental regulations, including those related to
    climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, could exceed our
    current expectations.

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
    pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and
    municipal laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations
    impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and
    obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use,
    storage, extraction, transportation, treatment and disposal of
    hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills,
    releases and emissions of various substances into the
    environment, and in connection with the operation, maintenance,
    abandonment and reclamation of our facilities. Various
    governmental authorities, including the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) and analogous state agencies and the
    United States Department of Homeland Security, have the power to
    enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the
    permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and
    costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations,
    and permits may result in the assessment of administrative,
    civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial
    obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or
    revocation of permits, and the issuance of injunctions limiting
    or preventing some or all of our operations.

Compliance with environmental laws requires significant
    expenditures, including clean up costs and damages arising out
    of contaminated properties. Joint and several, strict liability
    may be incurred without regard to fault under certain
    environmental laws and regulations for the remediation of
    contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of
    natural gas and wastes on, under, or from our properties and
    facilities. Private parties, including the owners of properties
    through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass, may have
    the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well
    as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws
    and regulations or for personal injury or property damage
    arising from our operations.

We are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with
    the environmental condition of our facilities and assets,
    whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the
    liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In
    connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could
    acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against,
    environmental liabilities that could expose us to material
    losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the
    steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities
    into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might
    be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those
    facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. Although we do
    not expect that the costs of complying with current
    environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition or results of operations, no assurance can
    be given that the costs of complying with environmental laws in
    the future will not have such an effect.

Legislative and regulatory responses related to GHGs and climate
    change creates the potential for financial risk. The United
    States Congress and certain states have for some time been
    considering various forms of legislation related to GHG
    emissions. There have also been international efforts seeking
    legally binding reductions in emissions of GHGs. In addition,
    increased public awareness and concern may result in more state,
    federal, and international proposals to reduce or mitigate GHG
    emissions.

Several bills have been introduced in the United States Congress
    that would compel GHG emission reductions. In June of 2009, the
    U.S. House of Representatives passed the “American
    Clean Energy and Security Act” which is intended to
    decrease annual GHG emissions through a variety of measures,
    including a “cap and trade” system



which limits the amount of GHGs that may be emitted and
    incentives to reduce the nation’s dependence on traditional
    energy sources. The U.S. Senate is currently considering
    similar legislation, and numerous states have also announced or
    adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHGs. In addition, on
    December 7, 2009, the EPA issued a final determination that
    six GHGs are a threat to public safety and welfare. This
    determination is the latest in a series of EPA actions in 2009
    which could ultimately lead to the direct regulation of GHG
    emissions in our industry by the EPA under the Clean Air Act.
    While it is not clear whether or when any federal or state
    climate change laws or regulations will be passed, any of these
    actions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and
    maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls
    on our facilities, and (iii) administer and manage any GHG
    emissions program. If we are unable to recover or pass through a
    significant level of our costs related to complying with climate
    change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations. To the
    extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of
    GHGs as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost
    of and access to capital.

We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible
    expenditures related to environmental conditions based on
    current laws and regulations and current interpretations of
    those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or
    regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our
    assumptions may change. Our regulatory rate structure and our
    contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to
    recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new
    environmental regulations. Also, we might not be able to obtain
    or maintain from time to time all required environmental
    regulatory approvals for certain development projects. If there
    is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory
    approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the
    operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject
    to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse
    consequences to our results of operations.

If
    third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our
    pipeline and facilities become unavailable to transport natural
    gas and NGLs or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be
    adversely affected.

We depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that
    provide delivery options to and from our pipeline and facilities
    for the benefit of our customers. Because we do not own these
    third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation
    is not within our control. If these pipelines or other
    facilities were to become unavailable for any reason, or if
    throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage
    to the pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures,
    lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged
    by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our
    customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or
    deliver natural gas or NGL products to end use markets or to
    receive deliveries of mixed NGLs, thereby reducing our revenues.
    Further, although there are laws and regulations designed to
    encourage competition in wholesale market transactions, some
    companies may fail to provide fair and equal access to their
    transportation systems or may not provide sufficient
    transportation capacity for other market participants. Any
    temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline
    interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or
    facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes
    transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or
    processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our
    businesses are subject to complex government regulations. The
    operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by
    changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or
    implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations
    applicable to our businesses or our customers.

Existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws
    and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our
    facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and
    regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business.
    Specifically, the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation
    Commission has enacted new rules in 2009 which increased our
    costs of permitting and environmental compliance and the time
    required to obtain permits, which may have a material effect on
    our results of operations.



Legal
    and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the
    energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our
    business and may continue to do so.

Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the
    capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being
    either proposed or implemented. Such scrutiny has also resulted
    in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in
    which we are a named defendant. Both the shippers on our
    pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we
    charge under certain circumstances. Any successful challenge
    could materially affect our results of operations.

Certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are
    ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a
    whole. We might see these adverse effects continue as a result
    of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings,
    or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state
    regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we
    cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether
    these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings
    against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other
    regulatory action, including legislation, which might be
    materially adverse to the operation of our business and our
    revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other
    ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters against us
    arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including
    environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals and similar
    matters might result in adverse decisions against us. The result
    of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the
    aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at
    all by insurance.

Risks
    Related to Employees, Outsourcing of Noncore Support Activities,
    and Technology

Institutional
    knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement
    eligibility might not be adequately preserved.

In certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge
    resides with employees who have many years of service. As these
    employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace
    them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. In
    addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other
    qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer
    could be inadequate. If knowledge transfer, recruiting and
    retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts
    of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become
    unavailable to us.

Failure
    of or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might
    negatively impact our ability to conduct our
    business.

Some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing
    relationships. Although we have taken steps to build a
    cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our
    outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance,
    a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services
    performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or
    part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional
    knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be
    able to conduct our business. The expiration of such agreements
    or the transition of services between providers could lead to
    similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions.

Certain of our accounting, information technology, application
    development, and help desk services are currently provided by an
    outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the United
    States. The economic and political conditions in certain
    countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide
    services to us present similar risks of business operations
    located outside of the United States previously discussed,
    including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation,
    nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification
    of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are
    greater than in the United States.

Risks
    Related to Weather, other Natural Phenomena and Business
    Disruption

Our
    assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and
    other natural phenomena.

Our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can
    be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes,
    tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions,
    including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us
    to realize the historic rates of return associated with these
    assets and operations. Insurance may be inadequate, and in some
    instances, we have been unable to obtain insurance on
    commercially



reasonable terms, or insurance may not be available. A
    significant disruption in operations or a significant liability
    for which we were not fully insured could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

Our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions.
    To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change
    or demand is impacted by regulations associated with climate
    change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease
    depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, leading
    to either increased investment or decreased revenues.

Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be
    targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business
    or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or
    partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport
    or distribute natural gas, natural gas liquids or other
    commodities. Acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in
    response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause
    environmental repercussions that could result in a significant
    decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or
    remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Strategic
    Restructuring

On February 17, 2010, we completed a strategic
    restructuring, which involved contributing a substantial
    majority of our domestic midstream and gas pipeline businesses,
    including our limited- and general-partner interests in Williams
    Pipeline Partners L.P. (WMZ), into Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ).
    As consideration for the asset contributions, we received
    proceeds from WPZ’s debt issuance of approximately
    $3.5 billion, less WPZ’s transaction fees and
    expenses, as well as 203 million WPZ Class C units,
    which are identical to common units, except for a prorated
    initial distribution. We also maintained our 2 percent
    general-partner interest. WPZ assumed approximately
    $2 billion of existing debt associated with the gas
    pipeline assets. In connection with the restructuring, we
    retired $3 billion of our debt and paid $574 million
    in related premiums. These amounts, as well as other transaction
    costs, were primarily funded with the cash consideration
    received from WPZ. The premiums paid and certain other
    transaction costs will be recorded as expense in the first
    quarter of 2010. As a result of our restructuring, we are better
    positioned to drive additional growth and pursue value-adding
    growth strategies. Our new structure is designed to lower
    capital costs, enhance reliable access to capital markets, and
    create a greater ability to pursue development projects and
    acquisitions. (See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

In conjunction with the restructuring, WPZ intends to make an
    exchange offer for the publicly held units of WMZ at a future
    date. See “Strategic Restructuring” in Part I,
    Item 1 of this Form

10-K

for
    further discussion of this potential exchange offer.

Beginning with reporting of first-quarter 2010 results, we will
    change our segment reporting structure to align with the new
    parent-level focus, resource allocation management and related
    governance provisions resulting from the restructuring. Our
    reporting segments will be Williams Partners,
    Exploration & Production, and Other.
    Exploration & Production will include our current Gas
    Marketing segment and Other will include certain midstream and
    gas pipeline businesses that were not contributed to WPZ, such
    as our Canadian and olefins midstream businesses and the
    remaining 25.5 percent interest in Gulfstream, as well as
    corporate operations.

Information in this report has generally been prepared to be
    consistent with the reportable segment presentation in our
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8
    of this document, which reflects our segment reporting structure
    prior to the restructuring.

General

We are primarily a natural gas company engaged in finding,
    producing, gathering, processing, and transporting natural gas.
    Our operations are located principally in the United States and
    are organized into the following reporting segments as of
    December 31, 2009: Exploration & Production, Gas
    Pipeline, Midstream Gas & Liquids, and Gas Marketing
    Services. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements and Part I Item 1 for further discussion of
    these segments.)

Unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and
    analysis of critical accounting estimates, results of
    operations, and financial condition and liquidity relates to our
    current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction
    with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
    included in Part II, Item 8 of this document.

Overview
    of 2009

The overall economic recession, related lower energy commodity
    price environment, and challenging financial markets during the
    past year had a significant impact on our business. While we
    began to see improvement in the second half of the year, these
    conditions have resulted in sharply lower results of operations,
    cash flow from operations and capital expenditures in 2009
    compared to 2008. Anticipating these circumstances, our plan for
    2009 was built around the transition from significant growth to
    a focus on sustaining our current operations and reducing costs
    where appropriate. Although capital expenditures were reduced
    compared to the prior year, we continued to invest in our
    businesses with a focus on completing major projects, meeting
    legal, regulatory,

and/or

contractual



commitments, and maintaining a reduced level of natural gas
    production development. Objectives and highlights of this plan
    included:

Objectives

Highlights

Continuing to invest in our gathering and processing and
    interstate natural gas pipeline systems

We invested $513 million in capital expenditures in Midstream,
    primarily Deepwater Gulf expansion projects and gas-processing
    capacity in the western United States. We also invested $485
    million in capital expenditures in Gas Pipeline during 2009.

Continuing to invest in our natural gas production development,
    although at a lower level than in recent years

We invested $1.3 billion in drilling activity and the
    acquisition of additional producing properties in Exploration
    & Production.

Retaining the flexibility to adjust our planned levels of
    capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in
    economic conditions, as well as seizing attractive opportunities

During 2009, capital and investment purchases were funded
    primarily through cash flow from operations while maintaining
    liquidity of at least $1 billion from

cash and cash
    equivalents

and unused revolving credit facilities. In
    addition, our Exploration & Production and Midstream
    segments seized growth opportunities to enter the Marcellus
    Shale, while Exploration & Production also expanded its
    footprint in the Piceance basin. (See further discussion in
    Other Significant 2009 Events.)

Our 2009

income from continuing operations

attributable
    to The Williams Companies, Inc., decreased by $868 million
    compared to 2008. This decrease is primarily reflective of the
    overall unfavorable commodity price environment for the full
    year of 2009 as compared to 2008. Commodity prices declined
    sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008, but have improved in the
    latter half of 2009. See additional discussion in Results of
    Operations.

Our

net cash provided by operating activities

for 2009
    decreased $783 million compared to 2008, primarily due to
    the decrease in our operating results. See additional discussion
    in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Liquidity.

Other
    Significant 2009 Events

In March 2009, we issued $600 million aggregate principal
    amount of 8.75 percent senior unsecured notes due 2020 to
    certain institutional investors in a private debt placement. In
    August 2009, we completed an exchange of these notes for
    substantially identical new notes that are registered under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

In April 2009, Midstream announced its plan to build a

261-mile

natural gas liquids pipeline in Canada at an estimated cost of
    $283 million. Construction is expected to begin in 2010
    with completion expected in 2012.

In May 2009, certain of Midstream’s Venezuela operations
    were expropriated by the Venezuelan government. As a result,
    these operations are now reflected as discontinued operations
    and have been deconsolidated. (See Note 2 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In June 2009, Midstream finalized the formation of a new joint
    venture in the Marcellus Shale located in southwest
    Pennsylvania. (See Results of Operations — Segments,
    Midstream Gas & Liquids.)

In June 2009, Exploration & Production entered into an
    agreement to develop properties in the Marcellus Shale. (See
    Results of Operations — Segments,
    Exploration & Production.)

In September 2009, Exploration & Production completed
    the purchase of additional properties in the Piceance basin of
    Colorado for $253 million. (See Results of
    Operations — Segments, Exploration &
    Production.)

In September 2009, Gas Pipeline received approval from the FERC
    to begin construction of the 85 North expansion project at an
    estimated cost of $241 million. (See Results of
    Operations — Segments, Gas Pipeline.)



Outlook
    for 2010

We believe we are well positioned to execute on our 2010
    business plan and to capture attractive growth opportunities.
    The economic environment in the latter half of 2009 has improved
    compared to conditions earlier in the year. In addition,
    economic and commodity price indicators for 2010 and beyond
    reflect continued improvement in the economic environment.
    However, given the potential volatility of these measures, it is
    reasonably possible that the economy could worsen

and/or

commodity prices could decline, negatively impacting future
    operating results and increasing the risk of nonperformance of
    counterparties or impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets.

As a result of our 2010 restructuring, as previously discussed,
    we are better positioned to drive additional growth and pursue
    value-adding growth strategies. Our new structure is designed to
    lower capital costs, enhance reliable access to capital markets,
    and create a greater ability to pursue development projects and
    acquisitions.

We continue to operate with a focus on
    EVA

®

and invest in our businesses in a way that meets customer needs
    and enhances our competitive position by:

•

Continuing to invest in and grow our gathering and processing
    and interstate natural gas pipeline systems;

•

Continuing to invest in our natural gas drilling at a level
    generally consistent with the prior year and maintaining
    capacity to consider additional investment in attractive
    opportunities to diversify our reserves;

•

Retaining the flexibility to adjust our planned levels of
    capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in
    economic conditions.

Potential risks

and/or

obstacles that could impact the execution of our plan include:

•

Lower than anticipated commodity prices;

•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations;

•

Availability of capital;

•

Counterparty credit and performance risk;

•

Decreased drilling success at Exploration & Production;

•

Decreased volumes from third parties served by Midstream;

•

General economic, financial markets, or industry downturn;

•

Changes in the political and regulatory environments;

•

Physical damages to facilities, especially damage to offshore
    facilities by named windstorms for which our aggregate insurance
    policy limit is $37.5 million in the event of a material
    loss.

We continue to address these risks through utilization of
    commodity hedging strategies, disciplined investment strategies,
    and maintaining at least $1 billion in liquidity from cash
    and cash equivalents and unused revolving credit facilities. In
    addition, we utilize master netting agreements and collateral
    requirements with our counterparties to reduce credit risk and
    liquidity requirements.

Accounting
    Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted

Accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet
    adopted may have an effect on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the future.

See

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted

in
    Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information on recently issued accounting standards.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions. We have discussed the following
    accounting estimates and



assumptions as well as related disclosures with our Audit
    Committee. We believe that the nature of these estimates and
    assumptions is material due to the subjectivity and judgment
    necessary, or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and
    the impact of these on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

Impairments
    of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when we believe
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be
    able to recover the carrying value. Our computations utilize
    judgments and assumptions that may include the estimated fair
    value of the asset, undiscounted future cash flows, discounted
    future cash flows, and the current and future economic
    environment in which the asset is operated.

We assess our natural gas-producing properties and associated
    unproved leasehold costs for impairment using estimates of
    future cash flows. Significant judgments and assumptions in
    these assessments include estimates of natural gas reserves
    quantities, estimates of future natural gas prices using a
    forward NYMEX curve adjusted for locational basis differentials,
    drilling plans, expected capital costs, and an applicable
    discount rate commensurate with risk of the underlying cash flow
    estimates. Considering market-based pricing at December 31,
    2009, we are not currently aware of any significant properties
    that are approaching impairment thresholds.

In addition to those long-lived assets for which impairment
    charges were recorded (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements), certain others were reviewed for which no
    impairment was required. These reviews included
    Exploration & Production’s properties and
    utilized inputs consistent with those described above. Certain
    assets within our Midstream segment were also evaluated for
    impairment utilizing judgments and assumptions including future
    fees, margins, and volumes. These underlying variables are
    subjective and susceptible to change. The use of alternate
    judgments and assumptions could result in the recognition of
    different levels of impairment charges in the consolidated
    financial statements.

We have goodwill of approximately $1 billion at
    Exploration & Production related to its domestic
    operations (the reporting unit) primarily resulting from a 2001
    acquisition. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of
    the end of the year. Because quoted market prices are not
    available for the reporting unit, management applies a range of
    reasonable judgments (including market supported assumptions
    when available) in estimating a range of fair values for the
    reporting unit.

We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit on a
    stand-alone basis and also consider our market capitalization in
    corroborating our estimate of the fair value of the reporting
    unit. As of December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of
    the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, including
    goodwill, indicating no impairment of Exploration &
    Production’s goodwill.

We estimated the fair value of the reporting unit on a
    stand-alone basis primarily by valuing proved and unproved
    reserves. We used an income approach (discounted cash flows) for
    valuing reserves. The significant inputs into the valuation of
    proved reserves included reserve quantities, forward natural gas
    prices, anticipated drilling and operating costs, anticipated
    production curves, and appropriate discount rates. Unproved
    reserves were valued using similar assumptions adjusted further
    for the uncertainty associated with these reserves. We
    corroborated our fair value estimates with recent market
    transactions where possible.

In estimating the inputs, management must make assumptions that
    require judgments and are subject to change in response to
    changing market conditions and other future events. Significant
    assumptions in valuing proved reserves included reserves
    quantities of more than 4.7 Tcfe, forward natural gas
    prices, adjusted for locational differences, averaging
    approximately $5.97 per Mcfe, and an after-tax discount rate of
    11 percent.

At December 31, 2009, we believe that an overall
    20 percent or greater reduction to our estimates of future
    revenues, which are a component of our estimates of future cash
    flows, could result in an impairment of goodwill. Future revenue
    estimates are largely impacted by estimated prices and reserves.
    This sensitivity does not include any related changes in
    operating taxes or production costs. We currently do not
    consider such a decrease in future revenues across all future
    periods to be likely.

We further reviewed the fair value of the reporting unit
    estimated on a stand-alone basis, by considering our market
    capitalization in a reconciliation of the fair values of all our
    businesses, including the reporting unit. In this



reconciliation, we determined our market capitalization,
    including a control premium, and estimated the fair values of
    all our businesses considering certain financial performance
    metrics. The range of control premiums that we considered were
    consistent with historical market sales transactions and also
    considered the current market environment. Market capitalization
    was based on our traded stock price for a reasonably short
    period of time before and after December 31, 2009. In
    evaluating the items in our reconciliation analysis, management
    considered a range of reasonable judgments. This analysis
    allowed management to consider market expectations in
    corroborating the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of
    the reporting unit.

We also perform interim assessments of goodwill if impairment
    triggering events or circumstances are present. Examples of
    impairment triggering events or circumstances include:

•

The testing for recoverability of a significant long-lived asset
    group within the reporting unit;

•

Sustained operating losses or negative cash flows at the
    reporting unit level;

•

A significant decline in forward natural gas prices or reserve
    quantities;

•

Not meeting internal forecasts, or significant downward
    adjustments to future forecasts;

•

A decline in enterprise market capitalization below our total
    consolidated stockholders’ equity;

•

Industry trends.

We cannot predict future market conditions and events that might
    adversely affect the estimated fair value of the
    Exploration & Production reporting unit and possibly
    the reported value of goodwill. The estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit is significantly affected by natural gas prices,
    reserve quantities, and market expectations for required rates
    of return. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in
    estimating quantities of reserves that could affect our reserve
    quantities. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations,
    or the lack of available capital for projects could adversely
    affect the development and production of additional reserves.
    Given the challenges affecting our businesses and the energy
    industry in 2010, these factors could impact us and require us
    to perform interim assessments of goodwill for possible
    impairment during 2010, which could result in a material
    impairment of our goodwill.

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We review our energy contracts to determine whether they are, or
    contain derivatives. We further assess the appropriate
    accounting method for any derivatives identified, which could
    include:

•

Qualifying for and electing cash flow hedge accounting, which
    recognizes changes in the fair value of the derivative in other
    comprehensive income (to the extent the hedge is effective)
    until the hedged item is recognized in earnings;

•

Qualifying for and electing accrual accounting under the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception; or

•

Applying

mark-to-market

accounting, which recognizes changes in the fair value of the
    derivative in earnings.

If cash flow hedge accounting or accrual accounting is not
    applied, a derivative is subject to

mark-to-market

accounting. Determination of the accounting method involves
    significant judgments and assumptions, which are further
    described below.

The determination of whether a derivative contract qualifies as
    a cash flow hedge includes an analysis of historical market
    price information to assess whether the derivative is expected
    to be highly effective in offsetting the cash flows attributed
    to the hedged risk. We also assess whether the hedged forecasted
    transaction is probable of occurring. This assessment requires
    us to exercise judgment and consider a wide variety of factors
    in addition to our intent, including internal and external
    forecasts, historical experience, changing market and business
    conditions, our financial and operational ability to carry out
    the forecasted transaction, the length of time until the
    forecasted transaction is projected to occur, and the quantity
    of the forecasted transaction. In addition, we compare actual
    cash flows to those that were expected from the underlying risk.
    If a hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of



occurring, or if the derivative contract is not expected to be
    highly effective, the derivative does not qualify for hedge
    accounting.

For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, we must
    periodically assess whether they continue to qualify for hedge
    accounting. We prospectively discontinue hedge accounting and
    recognize future changes in fair value directly in earnings if
    we no longer expect the hedge to be highly effective, or if we
    believe that the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer
    probable of occurring. If the forecasted transaction becomes
    probable of not occurring, we reclassify amounts previously
    recorded in other comprehensive income into earnings in addition
    to prospectively discontinuing hedge accounting. If the
    effectiveness of the derivative improves and is again expected
    to be highly effective in offsetting the cash flows attributed
    to the hedged risk, or if the forecasted transaction again
    becomes probable, we may prospectively re-designate the
    derivative as a hedge of the underlying risk.

Derivatives for which the normal purchases and normal sales
    exception has been elected are accounted for on an accrual
    basis. In determining whether a derivative is eligible for this
    exception, we assess whether the contract provides for the
    purchase or sale of a commodity that will be physically
    delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold over a
    reasonable period in the normal course of business. In making
    this assessment, we consider numerous factors, including the
    quantities provided under the contract in relation to our
    business needs, delivery locations per the contract in relation
    to our operating locations, duration of time between entering
    the contract and delivery, past trends and expected future
    demand, and our past practices and customs with regard to such
    contracts. Additionally, we assess whether it is probable that
    the contract will result in physical delivery of the commodity
    and not net financial settlement.

Since our energy derivative contracts could be accounted for in
    three different ways, two of which are elective, our accounting
    method could be different from that used by another party for a
    similar transaction. Furthermore, the accounting method may
    influence the level of volatility in the financial statements
    associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives, as
    generally depicted below:

    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Oil-
    and Gas-Producing Activities

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil-
    and gas-producing activities. Estimated natural gas and oil
    reserves and forward market prices for oil and gas are a
    significant part of our financial calculations. Following are
    examples of how these estimates affect financial results:

•

An increase (decrease) in estimated proved oil and gas reserves
    can reduce (increase) our

unit-of-production

depreciation, depletion and amortization rates.

•

Changes in oil and gas reserves and forward market prices both
    impact projected future cash flows from our oil and gas
    properties. This, in turn, can impact our periodic impairment
    analyses, including that for goodwill.

The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very
    complex, requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all
    available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic
    data. After being estimated internally, approximately
    99 percent of our reserve estimates are either audited or
    prepared by independent experts. (See Part I Item 1
    for further discussion.) The data may change substantially over
    time as a result of numerous factors, including additional
    development cost and activity, evolving production history, and
    a continual reassessment of the viability of production under
    changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to
    existing reserve estimates could occur from time to time. Such
    changes could trigger an impairment of our oil and



gas properties

and/or

goodwill and have an impact on our

depreciation, depletion
    and amortization

expense prospectively. For example, a
    change of approximately 10 percent in our total oil and gas
    reserves could change our annual

depreciation, depletion and
    amortization

expense between approximately $72 million
    and $87 million. The actual impact would depend on the
    specific basins impacted and whether the change resulted from
    proved developed, proved undeveloped or a combination of these
    reserve categories.

Forward market prices, which are utilized in our impairment
    analyses, include estimates of prices for periods that extend
    beyond those with quoted market prices. This forward market
    price information is consistent with that generally used in
    evaluating our drilling decisions and acquisition plans. These
    market prices for future periods impact the production economics
    underlying oil and gas reserve estimates. The prices of natural
    gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period, thus
    impacting our estimates. Significant unfavorable changes in the
    forward price curve could result in an impairment of our oil and
    gas properties

and/or

goodwill.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies,
    including environmental matters, when we assess that a loss is
    probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
    Revisions to contingent liabilities are generally reflected in
    income when new or different facts or information become known
    or circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions
    with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. Liabilities
    for contingent losses are based upon our assumptions and
    estimates and upon advice of legal counsel, engineers, or other
    third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter. As
    new developments occur or more information becomes available,
    our assumptions and estimates of these liabilities may change.
    Changes in our assumptions and estimates or outcomes different
    from our current assumptions and estimates could materially
    affect future results of operations for any particular quarterly
    or annual period. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Valuation
    of Deferred Tax Assets and Tax Contingencies

We have deferred tax assets resulting from certain investments
    and businesses that have a tax basis in excess of the book basis
    and from tax carry-forwards generated in the current and prior
    years. We must evaluate whether we will ultimately realize these
    tax benefits and establish a valuation allowance for those that
    may not be realizable. This evaluation considers tax planning
    strategies, including assumptions about the availability and
    character of future taxable income. At December 31, 2009,
    we have $681 million of deferred tax assets for which a
    $4 million valuation allowance has been established. When
    assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider
    forecasts of future company performance, the estimated impact of
    potential asset dispositions, and our ability and intent to
    execute tax planning strategies to utilize tax carryovers. The
    ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be
    materially different from those recorded, as influenced by
    potential changes in jurisdictional income tax laws and the
    circumstances surrounding the actual realization of related tax
    assets.

We regularly face challenges from domestic and foreign tax
    authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges
    include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions
    and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We
    evaluate the liability associated with our various filing
    positions by applying the two step process of recognition and
    measurement. The ultimate disposition of these contingencies
    could have a significant impact on operating results and net
    cash flows. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for
    which accruals have been established or were required to pay
    amounts in excess of our accrued liability, our effective tax
    rate in a given financial statement period may be materially
    impacted.

See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information.

Pension
    and Postretirement Obligations

We have employee benefit plans that include pension and other
    postretirement benefits. Net periodic benefit expense and
    obligations for these plans are impacted by various estimates
    and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include the
    expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount
    rates, expected rate of compensation increase, health care cost
    trend rates, and employee demographics, including retirement age
    and mortality. These assumptions are reviewed annually and
    adjustments are made as needed. The assumptions utilized to
    compute expense and the benefit obligations are shown in
    Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



The following table presents the estimated increase (decrease)
    in net periodic benefit expense and obligations resulting from a
    one-percentage-point change in the specified assumption.

Our expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, as
    determined at the beginning of each fiscal year, are based on
    the average rate of return expected on the funds invested in the
    plans. We determine our long-term expected rate of return on
    plan assets using our expectations of capital market results,
    which includes an analysis of historical results as well as
    forward-looking projections. These capital market expectations
    are based on a long-term period of at least ten years and
    consider our investment strategy and mix of assets, which is
    weighted toward domestic and international equity securities. We
    develop our expectations using input from several external
    sources, including consultation with our third-party independent
    investment consultant. The forward-looking capital market
    projections are developed using a consensus of economists’
    expectations for inflation, GDP growth, and dividend yield along
    with expected changes in risk premiums. The capital market
    return projections for specific asset classes in the investment
    portfolio are then applied to the relative weightings of the
    asset classes in the investment portfolio. The resulting rate is
    an estimate of future results and, thus, likely to be different
    than actual results.

The capital markets improved in 2009 and the benefit plans’
    assets reflect this improvement. While the 2009 investment
    performance was greater than our expected rates of return, the
    expected rates of return on plan assets are long-term in nature
    and are not significantly impacted by short-term market
    performance. Changes to our asset allocation would also impact
    these expected rates of return. Our expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets used for our pension plans has been
    7.75 percent since 2006. The 2009 actual return on plan
    assets for our pension plans was a gain of approximately
    21.8 percent. The ten-year average rate of return on
    pension plan assets through December 2009 was approximately
    2.2 percent and is largely affected by the approximately
    34.1 percent loss experienced in 2008.

The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations
    of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The
    objective of the discount rates is to determine the amount, if
    invested at the December 31 measurement date in a portfolio of
    high-quality debt securities, that will provide the necessary
    cash flows when benefit payments are due. Increases in the
    discount rates decrease the obligation and, generally, decrease
    the related expense. The discount rates for our pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans are determined separately
    based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective
    expected benefit cash flows as described in Note 7 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our discount rate
    assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and
    market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term
    high-quality debt securities as well as by the duration of our
    plans’ liabilities.

The expected rate of compensation increase represents average
    long-term salary increases. An increase in this rate causes the
    pension obligation and expense to increase.

The assumed health care cost trend rates are based on national
    trend rates adjusted for our actual historical cost rates and
    plan design. An increase in this rate causes the other
    postretirement benefit obligation and expense to increase.



Fair
    Value Measurements

Certain of our energy derivative assets and liabilities and
    other assets trade in markets with lower availability of pricing
    information requiring us to use unobservable inputs and are
    considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. At
    December 31, 2009, less than 1 percent of the total
    assets and total liabilities measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis are included in Level 3. For Level 2
    transactions, we do not make significant adjustments to
    observable prices in measuring fair value as we do not generally
    trade in inactive markets.

The determination of fair value for our assets and liabilities
    also incorporates the time value of money and various credit
    risk factors which can include the credit standing of the
    counterparties involved, master netting arrangements, the impact
    of credit enhancements (such as cash collateral posted and
    letters of credit) and our nonperformance risk on our
    liabilities. The determination of the fair value of our
    liabilities does not consider noncash collateral credit
    enhancements. For net derivative assets, we apply a credit
    spread, based on the credit rating of the counterparty, against
    the net derivative asset with that counterparty. For net
    derivative liabilities we apply our own credit rating. We derive
    the credit spreads by using the corporate industrial credit
    curves for each rating category and building a curve based on
    certain points in time for each rating category. The spread
    comes from the discount factor of the individual corporate
    curves versus the discount factor of the LIBOR curve. At
    December 31, 2009, the credit reserve is less than
    $1 million on our net derivative assets and $3 million
    on our net derivative liabilities. Considering these factors and
    that we do not have significant risk from our net credit
    exposure to derivative counterparties, the impact of credit risk
    is not significant to the overall fair value of our derivatives
    portfolio.

At December 31, 2009, 82 percent of our derivatives
    portfolio expires in the next 12 months and more than
    99 percent of our derivatives portfolio expires in the next
    36 months. Our derivatives portfolio is largely comprised
    of exchange-traded products or like products where price
    transparency has not historically been a concern. Due to the
    nature of the markets in which we transact and the relatively
    short tenure of our derivatives portfolio, we do not believe it
    is necessary to make an adjustment for illiquidity. We regularly
    analyze the liquidity of the markets based on the prevalence of
    broker pricing and exchange pricing for products in our
    derivatives portfolio.

At December 31, 2009, Level 2 includes option
    contracts that hedge future sales of production from our
    Exploration & Production segment; these options are
    structured as costless collars and are financially settled. They
    are valued using an industry standard Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. Prior to the third quarter of 2009, these options
    were included in Level 3 because a significant input to the
    model, implied volatility by location, was considered
    unobservable. However, due to the increased transparency, we now
    consider this input to be observable and have included these
    options in Level 2.

The instruments included in Level 3 at December 31,
    2009, consist of natural gas liquids swaps for our Midstream
    segment as well as natural gas index transactions that are used
    to manage the physical requirements of our
    Exploration & Production and Midstream segments. The
    change in the overall fair value of instruments included in
    Level 3 primarily results from changes in commodity prices.

Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement through December 2013 with certain banks that, so long
    as certain conditions are met, serves to reduce our usage of
    cash and other credit facilities for margin requirements related
    to instruments included in the facility.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we have recognized
    impairments of certain assets that have been measured at fair
    value on a nonrecurring basis. These impairment measurements are
    included in Level 3 as they include significant
    unobservable inputs, such as our estimate of future cash flows
    and the probabilities of alternative scenarios. (See
    Note 14 of notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

2009 vs.

Our consolidated results in 2009 declined significantly compared
    to 2008. These results reflect a rapid decline in energy
    commodity prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a
    result of the weakened economy. Energy commodity prices have
    generally improved during 2009, but not to levels experienced
    early in 2008.

The decrease in

revenues

is primarily due to decreased
    realized revenue at Gas Marketing primarily reflecting a
    decrease in average natural gas prices as well as lower natural
    gas liquid (NGL) and olefin production revenues and lower
    marketing revenues at Midstream. In addition,
    Exploration & Production revenues decreased primarily
    due to lower net realized average prices, partially offset by
    higher production volumes sold.

The decrease in

costs and operating expenses

is primarily
    due to decreased costs at Gas Marketing primarily reflecting a
    decrease in average natural gas prices as well as decreased
    marketing purchases and decreased costs associated with our
    olefin and NGL production businesses at Midstream.



Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income

in 2009 includes:

•

Gain of $40 million on the sale of our Cameron Meadows NGL
    processing plant at Midstream;

•

Expense of $32 million related to penalties from the early
    termination of certain drilling rig contracts at
    Exploration & Production;

•

Impairment charges totaling $20 million at
    Exploration & Production.

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income

in 2008 includes:

•

Gain of $148 million on the sale of our Peru interests at
    Exploration & Production;

•

Net gains of $39 million on foreign currency exchanges at
    Midstream;

•

Income of $32 million related to the partial settlement of
    our Gulf Liquids litigation at Midstream;

•

Gain of $10 million on the sale of certain south Texas
    assets at Gas Pipeline;

•

Income of $17 million resulting from involuntary conversion
    gains at Midstream;

•

Impairment charges totaling $143 million related to certain
    natural gas producing properties at Exploration &
    Production;

•

Expense of $23 million related to project development costs
    at Gas Pipeline.

General corporate expenses

increased primarily due to an
    increase in employee-related expenses, partially offset by a
    decrease in outside services.

The decrease in

operating income

generally reflects an
    overall unfavorable energy commodity price environment in 2009
    compared to 2008 and other changes as previously discussed.

The decrease in

investing income

is primarily due to a
    $75 million impairment of Midstream’s Accroven
    investment and an $11 million impairment of a cost-based
    investment at Exploration & Production. (See
    Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) A
    decrease in interest income, primarily due to lower average
    interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008, also contributed to the
    decrease in

investing income.

Provision for income taxes

decreased primarily due to
    lower pre-tax income. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the effective tax
    rates compared to the federal statutory rate for both years.

See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for a discussion of the items in

income (loss) from
    discontinued operations

.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

decreased reflecting the first-quarter 2009 impairments and
    related charges associated with Midstream’s discontinued
    Venezuela operations (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements) and the decline in Williams Partners
    L.P.’s operating results primarily driven by lower NGL
    margins.

2008 vs.

Our consolidated results in 2008 improved significantly compared
    to 2007. However, these results were considerably influenced by
    favorable results in the first three quarters of the year,
    followed by a sharp decline in the fourth quarter due to a rapid
    decline in energy commodity prices.

The increase in

revenues

is primarily due to higher
    production revenues at Exploration & Production
    resulting from both higher net realized average prices and
    increased production volumes sold. Midstream also experienced
    higher olefin production revenues primarily due to higher
    average prices and volumes as well as increased NGL production
    revenues resulting from higher average prices, partially offset
    by lower volumes. Additionally, Gas Marketing revenues increased
    primarily due to favorable price movements on derivative
    positions economically hedging the anticipated withdrawals of
    natural gas from storage and the absence of a loss recognized on
    a legacy derivative sales contract in 2007.



The increase in

costs and operating expenses

is primarily
    due to increased costs associated with our olefin and NGL
    production businesses at Midstream. Higher depreciation,
    depletion, and amortization and higher operating taxes at
    Exploration & Production also contributed to the
    increase in expenses.

The increase in

selling, general and administrative expenses

(

SG&A)

primarily includes the impact of higher
    staffing and compensation at our Exploration &
    Production and Midstream segments in support of increased
    operational activities.

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income

in 2007 includes:

•

Income of $18 million associated with payments received for
    a terminated firm transportation agreement on Northwest
    Pipeline’s Grays Harbor lateral;

•

Income of $17 million associated with a change in estimate
    related to a regulatory liability at Northwest Pipeline;

•

Income of $12 million related to a favorable litigation
    outcome at Midstream;

•

Income of $8 million due to the reversal of a planned major
    maintenance accrual at Midstream;

•

Expense of $20 million related to an accrual for litigation
    contingencies at Gas Marketing;

•

Net losses of $11 million on foreign currency exchanges at
    Midstream;

•

Expense of $10 million related to an impairment of the
    Carbonate Trend pipeline at Midstream.

The increase in

operating income

reflects improved
    operating results at Exploration & Production due to
    higher net realized average prices, natural gas production
    growth and a gain of $148 million on the sale of our Peru
    interests, partially offset by increased operating costs and
    $143 million of property impairments in 2008. The increase
    also reflects improved results at Gas Marketing primarily due to
    favorable price movements on derivative positions economically
    hedging the anticipated withdrawals of natural gas from storage
    and the absence of a loss recognized on a legacy derivative
    sales contract in 2007. Partially offsetting these increases is
    a decrease in

operating income

at Midstream primarily due
    to a sharp decline in energy commodity prices in the latter part
    of 2008.

Interest accrued — net

decreased primarily due
    to increased capitalized interest resulting from an increased
    level of capital expenditures. The decrease was also a result of
    lower interest rates on debt issuances that occurred late in the
    fourth quarter of 2007 and in the first half of 2008 for which
    the proceeds were primarily used to retire existing debt bearing
    higher interest rates. While our overall debt balances have been
    relatively comparable, the net effect of these retirements and
    issuances has resulted in lower rates.

The decrease in

investing income

is primarily due to a
    decrease in interest income largely resulting from lower average
    interest rates in 2008 compared to 2007.

Early debt retirement costs

in 2007 includes
    $19 million of premiums and fees related to the December
    2007 repurchase of senior unsecured notes.

Provision for income taxes

increased primarily due to
    higher pre-tax income partially offset by a reduction in our
    estimate of the effective deferred state tax rate in 2008. See
    Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    reconciliation of the effective tax rate compared to the federal
    statutory rate for both years.

See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for a discussion of the items in

income (loss) from
    discontinued operations.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

increased primarily reflecting the growth in the
    noncontrolling interest holdings of Williams Partners L.P. and
    Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. in late 2007 and early 2008,
    respectively.



Results
    of Operations — Segments

As of December 31, 2009, we are organized into the
    following segments: Exploration & Production, Gas
    Pipeline, Midstream, Gas Marketing Services, and Other. Other
    primarily consists of corporate operations. Our management
    evaluates performance based on segment profit (loss) from
    operations. (See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.)

As previously discussed, our reportable segments will change in
    the first quarter of 2010 as a result of our restructuring
    transactions.

Exploration &
    Production

Overview
    of 2009

Segment revenues and segment profit for 2009 were significantly
    lower than 2008 primarily due to a sharp decline in net realized
    average prices partially offset by higher production volumes.
    Additionally, 2009 results include expense of $32 million
    associated with contractual penalties from the early termination
    of drilling rig contracts and $20 million of impairment
    charges. Highlights of the comparative periods include:

•

The increased production is primarily within the Piceance,
    Powder River, and Fort Worth basins. We reduced development
    activities and related capital expenditures in 2009, which
    resulted in production peaking during the first quarter of 2009,
    then decreasing slightly thereafter.

•

Net realized average prices include market prices, net of fuel
    and shrink and hedge gains and losses, less gathering and
    transportation expenses. The realized hedge gain per Mcfe was
    $1.43 and $.09 for 2009 and 2008, respectively.

We drilled 875 gross domestic productive development wells
    in 2009 with a success rate of 99 percent. On
    January 14, 2009, the SEC issued the

Final Rule for
    Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting

which affects how oil
    and gas companies report their reserves. These changes included:
    (1) applying the expanded definition of oil and gas
    reserves used for reserves estimation supported by reliable
    technologies and reasonable certainty; (2) revising proved
    undeveloped reserve estimates based on new guidance; and
    (3) estimating proved reserves for disclosure in SEC
    filings using the

12-month

average,

first-of-the-month

price instead of a

single-day,

period-end price. The FASB substantially conformed its
    requirements to the SEC rule with the issuance of its Accounting
    Standards Update

2010-03,

Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures

. Our
    estimated domestic proved reserves as of December 31, 2009
    are 4,255 Bcfe.

Significant
    Events

In June 2009, we entered into an agreement that allows us to
    acquire, through a “drill to earn” structure, a
    50 percent interest in approximately 44,000 net acres
    in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian basin.
    This agreement requires us to fund $33 million of drilling
    and completion costs on behalf of our partner and
    $41 million of our own costs and expenses prior to the end
    of 2011 to earn our 50 percent interest. This growth



opportunity leverages our experience in developing
    nonconventional natural gas reserves. Through December 2009, we
    have funded $14 million of the $33 million.

In September 2009, we completed the purchase of additional
    unproved leasehold acreage and proved properties in the Piceance
    basin for $253 million. In December 2009, we increased our
    working interest in these properties through a $22 million
    acquisition.

Outlook
    for 2010

We expect natural gas prices to increase in 2010, resulting in
    higher segment revenues and segment profit. We plan to maintain
    capital expenditures at a level similar to 2009 with a
    consistent level of drilling rigs operating in 2010 compared to
    2009. We have the following expectations and objectives for 2010:

•

Continuation of our development drilling program in the
    Piceance, Fort Worth, Powder River, San Juan and
    Appalachian basins. Our capital expenditures for 2010 are
    projected to be between $1 billion and $1.4 billion.
    This includes our drilling program in the Marcellus Shale that
    will enable us to meet the terms of our agreement as previously
    discussed.

•

Annual average daily domestic production level consistent with
    2009, with fourth quarter 2010 volumes likely to be higher than
    the prior year comparable period.

•

Stability in the costs of services and materials associated with
    development activities.

Risks to achieving our expectations and objectives include
    unfavorable natural gas market price movements which are
    impacted by numerous factors, including weather conditions,
    domestic natural gas production levels and demand, and a slower
    recovery in the global economy than expected. A significant
    decline in natural gas prices could impact these expectations
    for 2010, although the impact would be somewhat mitigated by our
    hedging program, which hedges a significant portion of our
    expected production.

In addition, changes in laws and regulations may impact our
    development drilling program. For example, the Colorado
    Oil & Gas Conservation Commission enacted new rules
    effective in April 2009 which increased our costs of permitting
    and environmental compliance and could potentially delay
    drilling permits. The new rules included additional
    environmental and operational requirements as part of permit
    approvals, tracking of certain chemicals brought on location,
    increased wildlife stipulations, new pit and waste management
    procedures and increased notifications and approvals from
    surface landowners. Our current outlook incorporates these
    changes; however, the extent and magnitude of other changes in
    laws and regulations could be greater than our current
    assumptions.

Commodity
    Price Risk Strategy

To manage the commodity price risk and volatility of owning
    producing gas properties, we enter into derivative contracts for
    a portion of our future production. For 2010, we have the
    following contracts for our daily domestic production, shown at
    weighted average volumes and basin-level weighted average prices:

Additionally, we utilize contracted pipeline capacity through
    Gas Marketing Services to move our production from the Rockies
    to other locations when pricing differentials are favorable to
    Rockies pricing. We hold a long-term obligation through Gas
    Marketing Services to deliver on a firm basis 200,000 MMbtu
    per day of gas to a buyer at the White River Hub
    (Greasewood-Meeker, Colorado), which is the major market hub
    exiting the Piceance basin. Our interest in the Piceance basin
    holds ample reserves to meet this obligation.

2009 vs.

The decrease in total

segment revenues

is primarily due
    to the following:

•

$725 million, or 27 percent, decrease in domestic
    production revenues reflecting $935 million associated with
    a 35 percent decrease in net realized average prices,
    partially offset by an increase of $210 million associated
    with a 8 percent increase in production volumes sold.
    Production revenues in 2009 and 2008 include approximately
    $93 million and $85 million, respectively, related to
    natural gas liquids (NGL) and approximately $36 million and
    $62 million, respectively, related to condensate. While NGL
    volumes were significantly higher than the prior year, NGL
    prices were significantly lower.

•

$169 million decrease primarily reflecting lower average
    sales prices for gas management activities related to gas
    purchased from certain outside parties, which is offset by a
    similar decrease in

segment costs and expenses.

Total

segment costs and expenses

decreased
    $62 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$163 million lower operating taxes due primarily to
    56 percent lower average market prices (excluding the
    impact of hedges), partially offset by higher production volumes
    sold. The lower operating taxes include a net decrease of
    $39 million reflecting a $34 million charge in 2008
    and $5 million of favorable revisions in 2009 relating to
    Wyoming severance and ad valorem tax issues;

•

$165 million decrease primarily reflecting lower average
    sales prices for gas management activities related to gas
    purchased from certain outside parties, which is offset by a
    similar decrease in

segment revenues

;

•

$143 million due to the absence of property impairments
    recorded in 2008 in the Arkoma basin;

•

$8 million lower lease and other operating expenses due to
    lower industry costs and activity partially offset by the effect
    of an increase in production volumes;



•

$5 million lower SG&A expenses, which includes lower
    bad debt expense related to the partial recovery of certain
    receivables previously reserved for in 2008 resulting from a
    bankrupt counterparty.

Partially offsetting the decreased costs are increases due to
    the following:

•

The absence of a $148 million gain recorded in 2008
    associated with the sale of our Peru interests;

•

$152 million higher depreciation, depletion and
    amortization expense primarily due to the impact of higher
    capitalized drilling costs from prior years and higher
    production volumes compared to the prior year. Also, we recorded
    an additional $17 million of depreciation, depletion, and
    amortization in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to new
    SEC reserves reporting rules. Our proved reserves decreased
    primarily due to the new SEC reserves reporting rules and the
    related price impact;

•

$48 million higher gathering fees primarily due to higher
    production volumes and the processing fees for natural gas
    liquids at Midstream’s Willow Creek plant, which began
    processing in August 2009;

•

$32 million of expense related to penalties from the early
    release of drilling rigs as previously discussed;

•

$20 million of impairment costs in the Fort Worth and
    Arkoma basins. We recorded a $15 million impairment in 2009
    related to costs of acquired unproved reserves resulting from a
    2008 acquisition in the Fort Worth basin. This impairment
    was based on our assessment of estimated future discounted cash
    flows and additional information obtained from drilling and
    other activities in 2009. We also recorded a $5 million
    impairment in the Arkoma basin in 2009 related to facilities;

•

$31 million higher exploratory expense in 2009, primarily
    related to $20 million of increased seismic costs and
    $12 million related to higher amortization and the
    write-off of lease acquisition costs. Dry hole costs for 2009
    and 2008 were $11 million and $12 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2009 we have approximately
    $14 million of capitalized drilling costs and
    $24 million of undeveloped leasehold costs related to
    continuing exploratory activities in the Paradox basin.

The $842 million decrease in s

egment profit

is
    primarily due to the 35 percent decrease in net realized
    average domestic prices and the other previously discussed
    changes in

segment revenues

and

segment costs and
    expenses.

2008 vs.

The increase in total

segment revenues

is primarily due
    to the following:

•

$919 million, or 53 percent, increase in domestic
    production revenues reflecting $571 million associated with
    a 28 percent increase in net realized average prices and
    $348 million associated with a 20 percent increase in
    production volumes sold. The impact of hedge positions on
    increased net realized average prices includes the effect of
    fewer volumes hedged by fixed-price contracts. The increase in
    production volumes reflects an increase in the number of
    producing wells primarily from the Piceance, Powder River, and
    Fort Worth basins. Production revenues in 2008 and 2007
    include approximately $85 million and $53 million,
    respectively, related to natural gas liquids and approximately
    $62 million and $40 million, respectively, related to
    condensate.

•

$151 million increase in revenues for gas management
    activities related to gas purchased from certain outside
    parties, which is substantially offset by a similar increase in

segment costs and expenses

. This increase is primarily
    due to increases in natural gas prices and volumes sold.

•

$17 million favorable change related to hedge
    ineffectiveness due to $1 million in net unrealized gains
    from hedge ineffectiveness in 2008 compared to $16 million
    in net unrealized losses in 2007.

Total

segment costs and expenses

increased
    $591 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$202 million higher depreciation, depletion and
    amortization expense, primarily due to higher production volumes
    and increased capitalized drilling costs.

•

$149 million increase in expenses for gas management
    activities related to gas purchased from certain outside
    parties, which is offset by a similar increase in

segment
    revenues

.



•

$143 million of property impairments in 2008 in the Arkoma
    basin.

•

$118 million higher operating taxes primarily due to both
    higher average market prices and higher domestic production
    volumes sold and the $34 million charge related to the
    Wyoming severance and ad valorem tax issue.

•

$61 million higher lease operating expenses from the
    increased number of producing wells primarily within the
    Piceance, Powder River, and Fort Worth basins combined with
    increased prices for well and lease service expenses and higher
    facility expenses.

•

$28 million higher SG&A expenses primarily due to
    increased staffing in support of increased drilling and
    operational activity, including higher compensation. The higher
    SG&A expenses also include an increase of $11 million
    in bad debt expense.

•

$17 million higher gathering expenses due to higher
    domestic production volumes.

•

$17 million of expense in 2008 related to the write-off of
    certain exploratory drilling costs for our domestic and
    international operations.

These increases are partially offset by the $148 million
    gain associated with the sale of our Peru interests in 2008.

The $504 million increase in s

egment profit

is
    primarily due to the 28 percent increase in domestic net
    realized average prices and the 20 percent increase in
    domestic production volumes sold, partially offset by the
    increase in total

segment costs and expenses

.

Gas
    Pipeline

Overview

Gas Pipeline’s strategy to create value focuses on
    maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing
    high quality, low cost transportation of natural gas to large
    and growing markets.

Gas Pipeline’s interstate transmission and storage
    activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such,
    our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in
    interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment
    of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things,
    are subject to regulation. The rates are established through the
    FERC’s ratemaking process. Changes in commodity prices and
    volumes transported have little near-term impact on revenues
    because the majority of cost of service is recovered through
    firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates.

Gas
    Pipeline master limited partnership

At December 31, 2009, we own approximately
    47.7 percent of WMZ, including 100 percent of the
    general partner, and incentive distribution rights. Considering
    the presumption of control of the general partner, we
    consolidate WMZ within our Gas Pipeline segment. Gas
    Pipeline’s segment profit includes 100 percent of
    WMZ’s segment profit. As previously discussed, our
    ownership in WMZ was affected by our 2010 restructuring
    transactions.

Significant events of 2009 include:

Completed
    Expansion Projects

Gulfstream
    Phase IV

In September 2007, our 50 percent-owned equity investee,
    Gulfstream, received FERC approval to construct 17.8 miles
    of

20-inch

pipeline and to install a new compressor facility. The pipeline
    expansion was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2008,
    and the compressor facility was placed into service in January
    2009. The expansion increased capacity by 155 Mdt/d.
    Gulfstream’s cost of this project is $190 million.



Sentinel

In August 2008, we received FERC approval to construct an
    expansion in the northeast United States. The cost of the
    project is estimated to be $229 million. We placed Phase I
    into service in December 2008 increasing capacity by 40 Mdt/d.
    Phase II provided an additional 102 Mdt/d and was placed
    into service in November 2009.

Colorado
    Hub Connection

In April 2009, we received approval from the FERC to construct a

27-mile

pipeline to provide increased access to the Rockies natural gas
    supplies. Construction began in June 2009 and the project was
    placed into service in November 2009. We combined lateral
    capacity with existing mainline capacity to provide
    approximately 363 Mdt/d of firm transportation from various
    receipt points for delivery to Ignacio, Colorado. The estimated
    cost of the project is $60 million.

In-progress
    Expansion Projects

Mobile
    Bay South

In May 2009, we received approval from the FERC to construct a
    compression facility in Alabama allowing transportation service
    to various southbound delivery points. The cost of the project
    is estimated to be $37 million. The estimated project
    in-service date is May 2010 and will increase capacity by 253
    Mdt/d.

    North

In September 2009, we received approval from the FERC to
    construct an expansion of our existing natural gas transmission
    system from Alabama to various delivery points as far north as
    North Carolina. The cost of the project is estimated to be
    $241 million. Phase I service is anticipated to begin in
    July 2010 and will increase capacity by 90 Mdt/d. Phase II
    service is anticipated to begin in May 2011 and will increase
    capacity by 218 Mdt/d.

Mobile
    Bay South II

In November 2009, we filed an application with the FERC to
    construct additional compression facilities and modifications to
    existing facilities in Alabama allowing transportation service
    to various southbound delivery points. The cost of the project
    is estimated to be $36 million. The estimated project
    in-service date is May 2011 and will increase capacity by 380
    Mdt/d.

Sundance
    Trail

In November 2009, we received approval from the FERC to
    construct approximately 16 miles of

30-inch

pipeline between our existing compressor stations in Wyoming.
    The project also includes an upgrade to our existing compressor
    station and is estimated to cost $65 million. The estimated
    in-service date is November 2010 and will increase capacity by
    150 Mdt/d.

Outlook
    for 2010

In addition to the various in-progress expansion projects
    previously discussed, we have several other proposed projects to
    meet customer demands. Subject to regulatory approvals,
    construction of some of these projects could begin as early as
    2010.

2009 vs.

Segment revenues

decreased primarily due to a
    $53 million decrease in revenues from lower transportation
    imbalance settlements in 2009 compared to 2008 (offset in

costs and operating expenses

), partially offset by a
    $17 million increase in other service revenues and
    expansion projects placed into service by Transco.

Costs and operating expenses

decreased $27 million,
    or 3 percent, primarily due to a $53 million decrease
    in costs associated with lower transportation imbalance
    settlements in 2009 compared to 2008 (offset in

segment
    revenues

) and $11 million of income from an adjustment
    of state franchise taxes. Partially offsetting these decreases
    is a $13 million increase in depreciation expense due
    primarily to projects placed into service, a $10 million
    increase in transportation-related fuel expense resulting from
    less favorable recovery from customers due to pricing
    differences, and $7 million higher employee-related
    expenses.

SG&A

increased $6 million, or 4 percent,
    primarily due to an increase in pension expense.

Other (income) expense — net

reflects the
    absence of a $10 million gain on the sale of certain south
    Texas assets and a $9 million gain on the sale of excess
    inventory gas, both of which were recorded by Transco in 2008.
    Partially offsetting these unfavorable changes is
    $16 million lower project development costs in 2009.

Segment profit

decreased primarily due to the previously
    described changes, partially offset by higher equity earnings
    from Gulfstream.

2008 vs.

Segment revenues

increased primarily due to a
    $52 million increase in transportation revenues resulting
    primarily from Transco’s new rates, which were approved by
    the FERC as part of a general rate case and became effective
    March 2007, and expansion projects that Transco placed into
    service in the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition,

segment
    revenues

increased $28 million due to transportation
    imbalance settlements (offset in

costs and operating
    expenses

). Partially offsetting these increases is the
    absence of $59 million associated with a 2007 sale of
    excess inventory gas (offset in

costs and operating
    expenses

).

Costs and operating expenses

decreased $11 million,
    or 1 percent, primarily due to the absence of
    $59 million associated with a 2007 sale of excess inventory
    gas (offset in

segment revenues

). The decrease is
    partially offset by an increase in costs of $28 million
    associated with transportation imbalance settlements (offset in

segment revenues

) and higher rental expense related to
    the Parachute lateral that was transferred to Midstream in
    December 2007.

Other (income) expense — net

changed
    unfavorably by $31 million primarily due to the absence of
    $18 million of income recognized in 2007 associated with
    payments received for a terminated firm transportation agreement
    on Northwest Pipeline’s Grays Harbor lateral and the
    absence of $17 million of income recorded in 2007 for a
    change in estimate related to a regulatory liability at
    Northwest Pipeline. In addition, project development costs were
    $21 million higher in 2008. Partially offsetting these
    unfavorable changes is a $10 million gain on the sale of
    certain south Texas assets, and a $9 million gain on the
    sale of excess inventory gas, both of which were recorded by
    Transco in 2008.

The increase in

segment profit

is primarily due to the
    previously described changes and higher equity earnings from
    Gulfstream.

Midstream
    Gas & Liquids

Overview
    of 2009

Midstream’s ongoing strategy is to safely and reliably
    operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets
    can be fully utilized and drive low

per-unit

costs. We focus on consistently attracting new business by
    providing highly reliable service to our customers.



Significant events during 2009 include the following:

Cameron
    Meadows Plant

In November 2009, we sold our Cameron Meadows plant and
    recognized a pre-tax gain of $40 million. This plant
    sustained hurricane damage twice in recent years and is,
    therefore, considered incongruent with our strategy of providing
    the most reliable service in the industry.

Willow
    Creek

The Willow Creek facility in western Colorado began processing
    natural gas production and extracting NGLs in early August and
    achieved full processing operations in September. Currently, the

450-million-cubic-feet-per-day

(MMcf/d)

gas
    processing plant primarily processes Exploration &
    Production’s wellhead production, has a peak capacity of
    30,000 barrels of NGLs per day, and is recovering
    approximately 20,000 barrels per day. In the current
    processing arrangement with Exploration & Production,
    Midstream receives a volumetric-based processing fee and a
    percent of the NGLs extracted.

Laurel
    Mountain Midstream, LLC

In June 2009, we completed the formation of a new joint venture
    in the Marcellus Shale located in southwest Pennsylvania. Our
    partner in the venture contributed its existing Appalachian
    basin gathering system, which currently has an average
    throughput of approximately

100 MMcf/d.

In exchange for a 51 percent interest in the venture, we
    contributed $100 million and issued a $26 million note
    payable. We account for this investment under the equity method
    due to the significant participatory rights of our partner such
    that we do not control the investment. We have transitioned
    operational control from our partner to us.

Venezuela

In May 2009, the Venezuelan government expropriated the El
    Furrial and PIGAP II assets that we operated in Venezuela. As a
    result, these operations are now reflected as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented and are no longer included
    in Midstream’s results. Our investment in Accroven, whose
    assets have not been expropriated, is still included within
    Midstream and reflects a first-quarter 2009 impairment charge of
    $75 million. (See Notes 2 and 3 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.)

Volatile
    commodity prices

NGL prices, especially ethane prices, have generally improved
    during 2009, following significant declines in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 as a result of the weakened economy. Our NGL
    margins also benefited from a period of declining natural gas
    prices during 2009. While average annual

per-unit

NGL
    margins in 2009 were still significantly lower than 2008, they
    improved during 2009 to levels currently above the rolling
    five-year average

per-unit

margin. We continued to benefit from favorable natural gas price
    differentials in the Rocky Mountain area, although the
    differentials narrowed during 2009. These differentials
    contributed to realized

per-unit

margins that were generally greater than that of the industry
    benchmarks for natural gas processed in the Henry Hub area and
    for liquids fractionated and sold at Mont Belvieu, Texas.

NGL margins are defined as NGL revenues less any applicable BTU
    replacement cost, plant fuel, and third-party transportation and
    fractionation.

Per-unit

NGL
    margins are calculated based on sales of our own equity volumes
    at the processing plants.

Hurricane
    Impact to Insurance Coverage

While our insurance expense has increased modestly in 2009
    compared to 2008, the overall level of coverage on our offshore
    assets in the Gulf Coast region against named windstorm events
    has substantially decreased, including the absence of coverage
    on certain of our assets. (See Note 9 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Williams
    Partners L.P.

As of December 31, 2009, we own approximately
    23.6 percent of Williams Partners L.P., including
    100 percent of the general partner and incentive
    distribution rights. Considering the presumption of control of
    the general partner, we consolidate Williams Partners L.P.
    within the Midstream segment. (See Note 1 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.) Midstream’s segment
    profit includes 100 percent of Williams Partners
    L.P.’s segment profit. As previously discussed, our
    ownership in Williams Partners L.P. and our future segment
    reporting structure were affected by our 2010 restructuring
    transactions.

Outlook
    for 2010

The following factors could impact our business in 2010.

Commodity
    price changes

•

NGL, crude and natural gas prices are highly volatile and
    difficult to predict. However, we expect

per-unit

NGL
    margins in 2010 to be higher than our average

per-unit

margins in 2009 and our rolling five-year average

per-unit

NGL
    margins. NGL, crude and natural gas prices are highly volatile.
    NGL price changes have historically tracked somewhat with
    changes in the price of crude oil. Margins in our NGL and
    olefins business are highly dependent upon continued demand
    within the global economy. Although forecasted domestic and
    global demand for polyethylene, or plastics, has been impacted
    by the weakness in the global economy, NGL products are
    currently the preferred feedstock for ethylene and propylene
    production, which are the building blocks of polyethylene.
    Propylene and ethylene production processes have increasingly
    shifted from the more expensive crude-based feedstocks to
    NGL-based feedstocks. Bolstered by abundant long-term domestic
    natural gas supplies, we expect to benefit from these dynamics
    in the broader global petrochemical markets. As



natural gas pipeline transportation capacity increases in the
    Rocky Mountain area, we anticipate that historically favorable
    natural gas price differentials will decline.

•

In our olefin production business, we anticipate margins in 2010
    to show an improvement over 2009, similarly benefiting from the
    dynamics discussed above.

•

As part of our efforts to manage commodity price risks on an
    enterprise basis, we continue to evaluate our commodity hedging
    strategies. To reduce the exposure to changes in market prices,
    we have entered into NGL swap agreements to fix the prices of a
    small portion of our anticipated NGL sales for 2010. In
    addition, we have entered into financial contracts to fix the
    price of a portion of our shrink gas requirements for 2010.

Gathering,
    processing, and NGL sales volumes

•

The growth of natural gas supplies supporting our gathering and
    processing volumes are impacted by producer drilling activities.
    Our customers are generally large producers and we have not
    experienced and do not anticipate an overall significant decline
    in volumes due to reduced drilling activity.

•

In the West, we expect higher fee revenues, NGL volumes,
    depreciation expense and operating expenses in 2010 compared to
    2009 as our Willow Creek facility moves into a full year of
    operation, and our expansion at Echo Springs is completed late
    in 2010.

•

We expect fee revenues, NGL volumes, depreciation expense, and
    operating expenses in our offshore Gulf Coast region to increase
    from 2009 levels as our new Perdido Norte expansion begins

start-up

operations in the first quarter of 2010. Increases from our
    Perdido Norte expansion are expected to be partially offset by
    lower volumes in other Gulf Coast areas due to expected changes
    in gas processing contracts, as described below, and natural
    declines.

•

Certain of our gas processing contracts contain provisions that
    allow customers to periodically elect processing services on
    either a fee basis, keep-whole, or

percent-of-liquids

basis. If customers switch from keep-whole to fee-based
    processing, this would reduce our NGL equity sales volumes.

Allocation
    of capital to expansion projects

We expect to spend $500 million to $750 million in
    2010 on capital projects. The ongoing major expansion projects
    include:

•

The Perdido Norte project, in the western deepwater of the Gulf
    of Mexico, which includes an expansion of our Markham gas
    processing facility and oil and gas lines that will expand the
    scale of our existing infrastructure. Significant milestones
    have been reached and, considering the progress of our
    customer’s drilling and tie-in construction, we expect this
    project to begin

start-up

operations in the first quarter of 2010.

•

Additional processing and NGL production capacities at our Echo
    Springs facility and related gathering system expansions in the
    Wamsutter area of Wyoming, which we expect to be in service at
    the end of 2010.

•

We expect to begin construction in 2010 on a

12-inch

pipeline in Canada, which will transport recovered natural gas
    liquids and olefins from our extraction plant in
    Ft. McMurray to our Redwater fractionation facility. The
    pipeline will have sufficient capacity to transport additional
    recovered liquids in excess of those from our current
    agreements. We anticipate an in-service date in 2012.

•

In conjunction with a long-term agreement with a major producer,
    we will construct and operate a

28-mile

natural gas gathering pipeline in the Marcellus Shale region
    that will deliver to the Transco pipeline. Construction is
    expected to begin on the

20-inch

pipeline in the latter part of 2010, and it is expected to be
    placed into service during 2011.

•

In addition to our initial investment, we intend to invest
    additional capital within our Laurel Mountain joint venture to
    grow the existing gathering infrastructure in 2010 and beyond.

    the portion of general and administrative expense not allocated
    to an asset group as

indirect general and administrative
    expense

. These charges represent any overhead cost not
    directly attributable to one of the specific asset groups noted
    in this discussion.

2009 vs.

The decrease in

segment revenues

is largely due to:

•

A $716 million decrease in revenues associated with the
    production of NGLs primarily due to lower average NGL prices.

•

A $457 million decrease in revenues in our olefins
    production business primarily due to lower average product
    prices, partially offset by higher volumes.

•

A $438 million decrease in marketing revenues primarily due
    to lower average NGL and crude prices, partially offset by
    higher NGL volumes.

These decreases are partially offset by a $52 million
    increase in fee revenues primarily due to higher volumes
    resulting from connecting new supplies in the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico in the latter part of 2008 and new fees for processing
    Exploration & Production’s natural gas production
    at Willow Creek.

Segment costs and expenses

decreased $1,443 million,
    or 33 percent, primarily as a result of:

•

A $586 million decrease in marketing purchases primarily
    due to lower average NGL and crude prices, including the absence
    of a $19 million charge in 2008 to write-down the value of
    NGL and olefin inventories, partially offset by higher NGL
    volumes.

•

A $445 million decrease in costs in our olefins production
    business primarily due to lower

per-unit

feedstock costs, including the absence of an $11 million
    charge in 2008 to write-down the value of olefin inventories,
    partially offset by higher volumes.

•

A $435 million decrease in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs primarily due to lower average natural gas
    prices.

•

A $40 million gain on the 2009 sale of our Cameron Meadows
    processing plant.

•

The absence of $17 million of charges in 2008 related to an
    impairment, asset abandonments, and asset retirement obligations.

These decreases are partially offset by:

•

A $39 million unfavorable change due primarily to foreign
    currency exchange gains in 2008 related to the revaluation of
    current assets held in U.S. dollars within our Canadian
    operations.



•

The absence of $32 million of income in 2008 related to the
    partial settlement of our Gulf Liquids litigation (see
    Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

The decrease in Midstream’s

segment profit

reflects
    the previously described changes in

segment revenues

and

segment costs and expenses

and a $75 million loss
    from investment related to the impairment of our investment in
    Accroven.

A more detailed analysis of the segment profit of certain
    Midstream operations is presented as follows.

Domestic gathering & processing

The decrease in

domestic gathering & processing
    segment profit

includes a $193 million decrease in the
    West region and an $11 million decrease in the Gulf Coast
    region.

The decrease in our West region’s

segment profit

includes:

•

A $213 million decrease in NGL margins due to a significant
    decrease in average NGL prices, partially offset by a
    significant decrease in production costs reflecting lower
    natural gas prices. NGL equity volumes were slightly higher as
    both periods were impacted by significant volume changes.
    Current year volumes include the unfavorable impact of certain
    producers electing to convert, in accordance with those gas
    processing agreements, from keep-whole to fee-based processing
    at the beginning of 2009. Prior year NGL equity volumes sold
    were unusually low primarily due to an increase in inventory as
    we transitioned from product sales at the plant to shipping
    volumes through a pipeline for sale downstream, lower ethane
    recoveries to accommodate restrictions on the volume of NGLs we
    could deliver into the pipelines, and hurricane-related
    disruptions at a third-party fractionation facility at Mont
    Belvieu, Texas, which resulted in an NGL inventory

build-up.

Lower NGL transportation costs in the West region due to the
    transition from our previous shipping arrangement to
    transportation on the Overland Pass pipeline also favorably
    impacted NGL margins in 2009.

•

An $8 million decrease in involuntary conversion gains
    related to our Ignacio plant. These insurance recoveries in both
    years were used to rebuild the plant.

•

A $39 million increase in fee revenues primarily due to new
    fees for processing Exploration & Production’s
    natural gas production at Willow Creek, unusually low gathering
    and processing volumes in the first quarter of 2008 related to
    severe winter weather conditions, and producers converting from
    keep-whole to fee-based processing in the first quarter of 2009.

The decrease in the Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

includes:

•

A $68 million decrease in NGL margins reflecting lower
    average NGL prices and lower volumes. Lower production costs
    reflecting lower natural gas prices partially offset these
    decreases. Both periods were impacted by unfavorable volume
    changes. Current year volumes include the unfavorable impact of
    periods of reduced NGL recoveries during the first quarter due
    to unfavorable NGL economics and natural declines in production
    sources. Prior year volumes were unusually low primarily due to
    periods of reduced NGL recoveries during the fourth quarter and
    as a result of hurricanes in the third quarter.

•

A $40 million gain in 2009 on the sale of our Cameron
    Meadows processing plant, partially offset by the absence of a
    $5 million involuntary conversion gain in 2008 related to
    our Cameron Meadows plant.

•

$26 million higher fee revenues primarily due to higher
    volumes resulting from connecting new supplies in the Blind
    Faith prospect in the deepwater in the latter part of 2008.

•

The absence of $16 million of charges in 2008 related to an
    impairment, asset abandonments, and asset retirement obligations.

•

An $11 million increase in depreciation primarily due to
    our Blind Faith pipeline extensions that came into service
    during the latter part of 2008.



NGL marketing, olefins and other

The significant components of the increase in

segment profit

of our other operations include:

•

$138 million in higher margins related to the marketing of
    NGLs and olefins primarily due to favorable changes in pricing
    while product was in transit during 2009 as compared to
    significant unfavorable changes in pricing while product was in
    transit in 2008 and the absence of a $19 million charge in
    2008 to write-down the value of NGL and olefin inventories.

•

A $41 million unfavorable change primarily due to foreign
    currency exchange gains in 2008 related to the revaluation of
    current assets held in U.S. dollars within our Canadian
    operations.

•

The absence of $32 million of income in 2008 related to the
    partial settlement of our Gulf Liquids litigation.

•

$12 million in lower margins in our olefins production
    business primarily due to lower average prices, partially offset
    by lower

per-unit

feedstock costs, including the absence of an $11 million
    charge in 2008 to write-down the value of olefin inventories,
    and higher volumes in 2009 related to the impact of third-party
    operational issues in 2008 that reduced off-gas supplies to our
    plant in Canada.

•

The absence of an $8 million gain recognized in 2008
    related to a final earn-out payment on a 2005 asset sale.

Venezuela

The decrease in

segment profit

for our Venezuela
    operations primarily reflects the previously discussed
    $75 million loss from investment related to Accroven.

2008 vs.

The increase in

segment revenues

is largely due to:

•

A $210 million increase in revenues in our olefins
    production business primarily due to higher average product
    prices and also to higher volumes sold associated with the
    increase of our ownership interest in the Geismar olefins
    facility effective July 2007.

•

A $163 million increase in revenues associated with the
    production of NGLs primarily due to higher average NGL prices,
    partially offset by lower volumes. Lower volumes resulted from
    reduced ethane recoveries at the plants during the third and
    fourth quarters of 2008 compared to higher volumes during 2007
    as we transitioned from shipping volumes through a pipeline for
    sale downstream to product sales at the plant.

•

A $50 million increase in fee-based revenues primarily due
    to the West region, the deepwater Gulf Coast region and at our
    Conway fractionation and storage facilities.

These increases are partially offset by a $194 million
    decrease in marketing revenues primarily due to lower volumes,
    partially offset by higher prices.

Segment costs and expenses

increased $368 million,
    or 9 percent, primarily as a result of:

•

A $213 million increase in costs in our olefins production
    business due to higher feedstock prices and also to higher
    volumes produced associated with the increase of our ownership
    interest in the Geismar olefins facility effective July 2007.
    The increase also includes a $10 million higher charge to
    write-down the value of olefin inventories.

•

A $191 million increase in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs primarily due to higher average natural gas
    prices.

•

A $100 million increase in operating costs including higher
    depreciation, repair costs and property insurance deductibles
    related to the hurricanes, gas transportation expenses in the
    eastern Gulf of Mexico,



employee costs, and higher costs associated with the increase of
    our ownership interest in the Geismar olefins facility.

These increases are partially offset by:

•

A $68 million decrease in marketing purchases primarily due
    to lower volumes, partially offset by higher average NGL and
    crude prices and a $19 million charge in 2008 to write-down
    the value of NGL and olefin inventories.

•

A $49 million favorable change related to foreign currency
    exchange gains primarily due to the revaluation of current
    assets held in U.S. dollars within our Canadian operations.

•

$32 million of income in 2008 related to the partial
    settlement of our Gulf Liquids litigation.

•

A $16 million favorable change due to higher involuntary
    conversion gains in 2008 related to insurance recoveries in
    excess of the carrying value of our Ignacio and Cameron Meadows
    plants.

The decrease in Midstream’s

segment profit

reflects
    the previously described changes in

segment revenues

and

segment costs and expenses

. A more detailed analysis of
    the segment profit of certain Midstream operations is presented
    as follows.

Domestic gathering & processing

The decrease in

domestic gathering & processing
    segment profit

includes a $49 million decrease in the
    West region and a $7 million decrease in the Gulf Coast
    region.

The decrease in our West region’s

segment profit

includes:

•

A $45 million decrease in NGL margins due to a significant
    increase in costs associated with the production of NGLs
    reflecting higher natural gas prices and lower volumes sold. The
    decrease in volumes sold is primarily due to restricted
    transportation capacity, unfavorable ethane economics, an
    increase in inventory during 2008, hurricane-related disruptions
    at a third-party fractionation facility, and lower equity
    volumes as processing agreements change from keep-whole to
    fee-based. These decreases were partially offset by a full year
    of production from the fifth train at our Opal processing plant,
    which began production in the first quarter of 2007.

•

A $35 million increase in operating costs driven by higher
    turbine and engine overhaul expenses, depreciation expense and
    employee costs.

•

The absence of a $12 million favorable litigation outcome
    in 2007.

•

A $24 million increase in fee revenues including new lease
    revenues from Gas Pipeline for the Parachute lateral transferred
    to Midstream in December 2007.

•

A $12 million involuntary conversion gain in 2008 related
    to our Ignacio plant. These insurance recoveries were used to
    rebuild the plant.

The decrease in the Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

is primarily due to $39 million higher operating costs
    including higher depreciation, gas transportation expenses and
    hurricane repair and property insurance deductibles. These
    increased expenses are partially offset by $18 million
    higher NGL margins and $8 million higher fee revenues
    primarily due to connecting new supplies in the deepwater.

NGL marketing, olefins and other

The significant components of the decrease in

segment profit

of our other operations include:

•

$123 million in lower margins related to the marketing of
    NGLs and olefins primarily due to the impact of a significant
    and rapid decline in NGL and olefin prices during the fourth
    quarter of 2008 on a higher volume of product inventory in
    transit. This also includes a $19 million charge in 2008 to
    write-down the value of NGL and olefin inventories.



•

$33 million higher operating costs including higher costs
    associated with the increase of our ownership interest in the
    Geismar olefins facility effective July 2007 and hurricane
    damage repair expense at the Geismar plant.

•

A $56 million favorable change in foreign currency exchange
    gains related to the revaluation of current assets held in
    U.S. dollars within our Canadian operations.

•

$32 million of income in 2008 related to the partial
    settlement of our Gulf Liquids litigation.

Gas
    Marketing Services

Gas Marketing Services (Gas Marketing) primarily supports our
    natural gas businesses by providing marketing and risk
    management services, which include marketing and hedging the gas
    produced by Exploration & Production and procuring the
    majority of fuel and shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids
    sales for Midstream. Gas Marketing also provides similar
    services to third parties, such as producers and natural gas
    processors. In addition, Gas Marketing manages various natural
    gas-related contracts such as transportation and storage along
    with the related hedges, including certain legacy natural gas
    contracts and positions. We do not expect our future segment
    profit will be significantly impacted by these legacy contracts
    and positions.

Overview
    of 2009

Gas Marketing’s operating results for 2009 are unfavorable
    compared to 2008 primarily due to lower realized margins on our
    storage contracts. This decline was partially offset by reduced
    net losses on proprietary trading and legacy contracts and lower
    adjustments to the carrying value of our natural gas storage
    inventory.

Outlook
    for 2010

For 2010, Gas Marketing will focus on providing services that
    support our natural gas businesses. Gas Marketing’s
    earnings may continue to reflect

mark-to-market

volatility from commodity-based derivatives that represent
    economic hedges but are not designated as hedges for accounting
    purposes or do not qualify for hedge accounting.

    physical natural gas revenue as a result of a 53 percent
    decrease in average prices on physical natural gas sales,
    slightly offset by a 3 percent increase in natural gas
    sales volumes. This decline in

realized revenues

is
    primarily related to both gas sales associated with our
    transportation and storage contracts and gas sales associated
    with marketing Exploration & Production’s natural
    gas volumes. A corresponding decline in

segment costs and
    expenses

occurred in 2009.

Net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

gains (losses)

primarily represent changes in the fair
    values of certain derivative contracts with a future settlement
    or delivery date that are not designated as hedges for
    accounting purposes or do not qualify for hedge accounting. The
    decrease in

net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

gains



(losses)

is primarily related to the absence of a
    $10 million favorable impact in 2008 for the initial
    consideration of our own nonperformance risk in estimating the
    fair value of our derivative liabilities.

Total segment costs and expenses

decreased
    $3,339 million, primarily due to a 54 percent decrease
    in average prices on physical natural gas purchases, slightly
    offset by a 3 percent increase in natural gas purchase
    volumes. This decrease is primarily related to the previously
    discussed gas purchases associated with both our transportation
    and storage contracts and gas purchases from Exploration and
    Production. This decline also includes a lower adjustment to the
    carrying value of natural gas inventory in storage. These
    adjustments totaled $7 million in 2009 compared to
    $35 million in 2008.

The unfavorable change in

segment profit (loss)

is
    primarily due to a decline in realized margins on our storage
    contracts partially offset by lower adjustments to the carrying
    value of our natural gas storage inventory and reduced net
    losses on proprietary trading and legacy contracts.

2008 vs.

The increase in

realized revenues

is primarily due to an
    increase in physical natural gas revenue as a result of a
    26 percent increase in average prices on physical natural
    gas sales. This is slightly offset by a decrease related to net
    financial settlements of derivative contracts.

The favorable change in

net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

gains (losses)

includes the effect of a $156 million
    loss realized in December 2007 related to a legacy derivative
    natural gas sales contract. We had previously accounted for this
    contract on an accrual basis under the normal purchases and
    normal sales exception. We discontinued normal purchase and
    normal sales treatment because it was no longer probable that
    the contract would not be net settled. In addition, 2008
    reflects favorable price movements on our derivative positions
    executed to hedge the anticipated withdrawal of natural gas from
    storage.

Total segment costs and expenses

increased
    $1,439 million, primarily due to a 33 percent increase
    in average prices on physical natural gas purchases. These
    increases were partially offset by the absence of a
    $20 million accrual for litigation contingencies in 2007.

The favorable change in

segment profit (loss)

is
    primarily due to the favorable change in

net forward
    unrealized

mark-to-market

gains (losses)

, which includes the absence of a 2007 loss
    recognized on a legacy derivative natural gas sales contract.
    The favorable change in

segment profit (loss)

also
    reflects the absence of a $20 million accrual for
    litigation contingencies in 2007, partially offset by a decline
    in accrual earnings.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
    Liquidity

Overview

In 2009, we continued to focus upon growth through disciplined
    investments in our natural gas businesses. Examples of this
    growth included:

•

Continued investment in Exploration &
    Production’s development drilling programs, as well as the
    acquisition of additional producing properties and our initial
    entry into the Marcellus Shale area.



•

Expansion of Gas Pipeline’s interstate natural gas pipeline
    system to meet the demand of growth markets.

•

Continued investment in Midstream’s Deepwater Gulf
    expansion projects and gas processing capacity in the western
    United States and our initial entry into the Marcellus Shale
    area.

These investments were primarily funded through our cash flow
    from operations, which totaled nearly $2.6 billion for 2009.

During 2009, global credit markets experienced significant
    instability, markets witnessed significant reductions in value,
    and energy commodity prices experienced significant and rapid
    declines. In consideration of our liquidity under these
    conditions, we note the following:

•

We reduced our levels of capital expenditures.

•

As of December 31, 2009, we have approximately
    $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
    $2.1 billion of available credit capacity under our credit
    facilities. Our $1.5 billion credit facility does not
    expire until May 2012. Additionally, Exploration &
    Production has an unsecured credit agreement that serves to
    reduce our margin requirements related to our hedging
    activities. (See additional discussion in the following
    Available Liquidity section.)

•

We have no significant debt maturities until 2011.

•

Our credit exposure to derivative counterparties is partially
    mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral support.
    (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Strategic
    Restructuring

On February 17, 2010, we completed a strategic
    restructuring, which involved contributing a substantial
    majority of our domestic midstream and gas pipeline businesses,
    including our limited- and general-partner interests in Williams
    Pipeline Partners L.P. (WMZ), into Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ).
    We initially own approximately 84 percent of Williams
    Partners L.P., up from 24 percent of current partnership.
    Our total ownership percentage will decline to approximately
    80 percent assuming the successful completion of the
    exchange offer for all of WMZ’s publicly-held units. See
    “Strategic Restructuring” in Part I, Item 1
    of this Form

10-K

for
    further discussion of this potential exchange offer. We intend
    to hold our limited-partner and general-partner units for the
    long-term. As consideration for the asset contributions, we
    received proceeds from WPZ’s debt issuance of approximately
    $3.5 billion, less WPZ’s transaction fees and
    expenses, as well as 203 million WPZ Class C units,
    which are identical to common units, except for a prorated
    initial distribution. We also maintained our 2 percent
    general-partner interest. WPZ assumed approximately
    $2 billion of existing debt associated with the gas
    pipeline assets. In connection with the restructuring, we
    retired $3 billion of our debt and paid $574 million
    in related premiums. These amounts, as well as other transaction
    costs, were primarily funded with the cash consideration we
    received from WPZ. As a result of our restructuring, we are
    better positioned to drive additional growth and pursue
    value-adding growth strategies. Our new structure is designed to
    lower capital costs, enhance reliable access to capital markets,
    and create a greater ability to pursue development projects and
    acquisitions. (See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

Outlook

For 2010, we expect operating results and cash flows to improve
    from 2009 levels due to the impact of expected higher energy
    commodity prices.

Lower-than-expected

energy commodity prices would be somewhat mitigated by certain
    of our cash flow streams that are substantially insulated from
    changes in commodity prices as follows:

•

Firm demand and capacity reservation transportation revenues
    under long-term contracts from Gas Pipeline;

•

Hedged natural gas sales at Exploration & Production
    related to a significant portion of its production;

•

Fee-based revenues from certain gathering and processing
    services at Midstream.



We believe we have, or have access to, the financial resources
    and liquidity necessary to meet our requirements for working
    capital, capital and investment expenditures, and debt payments
    while maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity. In
    particular, we note the following assumptions for the coming
    year:

•

We expect to maintain liquidity of at least $1 billion from

cash and cash equivalents

and unused revolving credit
    facilities.

•

We expect to fund capital and investment expenditures, debt
    payments, dividends, and working capital requirements primarily
    through cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents on
    hand, utilization of our revolving credit facilities, and
    proceeds from debt issuances and sales of equity securities as
    needed. Based on a range of market assumptions, we currently
    estimate our cash flow from operations will be between
    $2.2 billion and $2.975 billion in 2010.

We expect capital and investment expenditures to total between
    $2.05 billion and $2.775 billion in 2010. Of this
    total, approximately 64 percent is considered
    nondiscretionary to meet legal, regulatory,

and/or

contractual requirements, to fund committed growth projects or
    to preserve the value of existing assets.

Potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity
    and the planned capital and investment expenditures discussed
    above include:

•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations;

•

Sustained reductions in energy commodity prices from the range
    of current expectations.

Liquidity

Based on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and
    other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient
    liquidity to manage our businesses in 2010. Our internal and
    external sources of liquidity include cash generated from our
    operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and our credit
    facilities. Additional sources of liquidity, if needed, include
    bank financings, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt
    and equity securities, and proceeds from asset sales. These
    sources are available to us at the parent level and may be
    available to certain of our subsidiaries, including equity and
    debt issuances from Williams Partners L.P. Our ability to raise
    funds in the capital markets will be impacted by our financial
    condition, interest rates, market conditions, and industry
    conditions.

At December 31, 2009, we are in compliance with the
    financial covenants associated with these credit agreements.
    These credit facilities were impacted by our previously
    discussed restructuring transactions. Williams Partners L.P.
    established a new $1.75 billion, three-year, senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaces its previous
    $450 million credit facility (which was comprised of a $250
    million term loan and a $200 million revolving credit facility).
    The full amount of the new credit facility is available to
    Williams Partners L.P. to the extent not otherwise utilized by
    Transco and Northwest Pipeline, and may be increased by up to an
    additional $250 million. Transco and Northwest Pipeline are
    co-borrowers and are each able to borrow up to $400 million
    under this new facility to the extent not otherwise utilized.
    Williams Partners L.P. utilized $250 million of the new
    facility to repay a term loan that was outstanding under its
    existing facility. As Williams Partners L.P. will be funding
    Midstream and Gas Pipeline projects, we reduced our
    approximately $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility that
    expires May 2012 to approximately $900 million and removed
    Transco and Northwest Pipeline as borrowers. See the financial
    covenants of the new facility in Note 19 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. filed a shelf registration
    statement for the issuance of up to $1.5 billion aggregate
    principal amount of debt and limited partnership unit
    securities. The registration statement was declared effective on
    August 3, 2009.

Williams Partners L.P. filed a shelf registration statement as a
    well-known, seasoned issuer in October 2009 that allows it to
    issue an unlimited amount of registered debt and limited
    partnership unit securities.

At the parent-company level, we filed a shelf registration
    statement as a well-known, seasoned issuer in May 2009 that
    allows us to issue an unlimited amount of registered debt and
    equity securities.

Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks that, so long as certain conditions
    are met, serves to reduce our use of cash and other credit
    facilities for margin requirements related to our hedging
    activities as well as lower transaction fees. The agreement
    extends through December 2013. (See Note 11 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Credit
    Ratings

Our ability to borrow money is impacted by our credit ratings
    and the credit ratings of WPZ. Following the closing of our 2010
    restructuring, our investment-grade ratings were affirmed and
    the ratings for WPZ were upgraded to investment grade. The
    current ratings are as follows:

    “BB” rating indicates that Standard &
    Poor’s believes the issuer has the capacity to meet its
    financial commitment on the obligation, but adverse business
    conditions could lead to insufficient ability to meet financial
    commitments. Standard & Poor’s may modify its
    ratings with a “+” or a “-” sign to show the
    obligor’s relative standing within a major rating category.

(2)

A rating of “Baa” or above indicates an investment
    grade rating. A rating below “Baa” is considered to
    have speculative elements. The “1,” “2,” and
    “3” modifiers show the relative standing within a
    major category. A “1”



Credit rating agencies perform independent analyses when
    assigning credit ratings. No assurance can be given that the
    credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment
    grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their current criteria
    for investment grade ratios. A downgrade of our credit rating
    might increase our future cost of borrowing and would require us
    to post additional collateral with third parties, negatively
    impacting our available liquidity. As of December 31, 2009,
    we estimate that a downgrade to a rating below investment grade
    would require us to post up to $585 million in additional
    collateral with third parties.

Our

net cash provided by operating activities

in 2009
    decreased from 2008 primarily due to the decrease in our
    operating results.

Significant transactions in 2008 include:

•

We received $140 million of cash related to a favorable
    resolution of matters involving pipeline transportation rates
    associated with our former Alaska operations. (See Note 2
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

    general rate case with the FERC. (See Results of
    Operations — Segments, Gas Pipeline.)

Our

net cash provided by operating activities

in 2008
    increased from 2007 primarily due to the increase in our
    earnings.

Financing
    activities

Significant transactions include:


•

We received $595 million net cash from the issuance of
    $600 million aggregate principal amount of

•

Williams Partners L.P. acquired certain of our membership
    interests in Wamsutter LLC, the limited liability company that
    owns the Wamsutter system, from us for $750 million.
    Williams Partners L.P. completed the transaction after
    successfully closing a public equity offering of
    9.25 million common units that yielded net proceeds of
    approximately $335 million. The partnership financed the
    remainder of the purchase price primarily through utilizing
    $250 million term loan borrowings under their
    $450 million five-year senior unsecured credit facility and

    and issued $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of
    senior unsecured notes of WPZ. Additionally, WPZ established a
    new $1.75 billion three-year unsecured revolving credit
    facility which replaces its previous $450 million credit
    facility. WPZ utilized $250 million of the new facility to
    repay a term loan that was outstanding under the previous
    facility. Williams has reduced its existing $1.5 billion
    unsecured

Effects
    of Inflation

Our operations have benefited from relatively low inflation
    rates. Approximately 37 percent of our gross property,
    plant and equipment is at Gas Pipeline. Gas Pipeline is subject
    to regulation, which limits recovery to historical cost. While
    amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under
    current FERC practices, we anticipate being allowed to recover
    and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to
    replace existing assets. Cost-based regulation, along with
    competition and other market factors, may limit our ability to
    recover such increased costs. For the other operating units,
    operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by both
    competition for specialized services and specific price changes
    in oil and natural gas and related commodities than by changes
    in general inflation. Crude, natural gas, and natural gas
    liquids prices are particularly sensitive to the Organization of
    the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production levels

and/or

the
    market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in
    the near future, as well as general economic conditions.
    However, our exposure to these price changes is reduced through
    the use of hedging instruments and the fee-based nature of
    certain of our services.



Environmental

We are a participant in certain environmental activities in
    various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations

and/or

remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently
    do not own (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements). We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated
    effort with other potentially responsible parties, the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other
    governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable
    along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities
    and solely responsible in others. Current estimates of the most
    likely costs of such activities are approximately
    $42 million, all of which are recorded as liabilities on
    our balance sheet at December 31, 2009. We will seek
    recovery of approximately $12 million of these accrued
    costs through future natural gas transmission rates. The
    remainder of these costs will be funded from operations. During
    2009, we paid approximately $8 million for cleanup

and/or

remediation and monitoring activities. We expect to pay
    approximately $10 million in 2010 for these activities.
    Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally
    based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of
    studies or our experience with other similar cleanup operations.
    At December 31, 2009, certain assessment studies were still
    in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield
    significantly different estimates of most likely costs.
    Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final
    amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these
    sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other
    governmental authorities, and other factors.

We are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and to the federal
    Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which require the EPA to issue
    new regulations. We are also subject to regulation at the state
    and local level. In September 1998, the EPA promulgated rules
    designed to mitigate the migration of ground-level ozone in
    certain states. Revisions to those rules were proposed in
    January 2010 and may result in additional controls. In March
    2004 and June 2004, the EPA promulgated additional regulation
    regarding hazardous air pollutants, which may result in
    additional controls. Capital expenditures necessary to install
    emission control devices on our Transco gas pipeline system to
    comply with rules were approximately $400 thousand in 2009 and
    are estimated to be between $5 million and $10 million
    through 2013. The actual costs incurred will depend on the final
    implementation plans developed by each state to comply with
    these regulations. We consider these costs on our Transco system
    associated with compliance with these environmental laws and
    regulations to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course
    of business and, therefore, recoverable through its rates.

We have established systems and procedures to meet our reporting
    obligations under the Mandatory Reporting Rule related to
    greenhouse gas emissions issued by the EPA in late 2009. Also,
    certain states in which we have operations have established
    reporting obligations. We have not incurred significant capital
    investment to meet the obligations imposed by these new rules.
    The EPA is developing additional regulations that will expand
    the scope of the Mandatory Reporting Rule, with particular
    emphasis on natural gas operations. We are participating
    directly and through trade associations in developmental aspects
    of that prospective rulemaking. It is likely that additional
    rules will be issued in 2010 which may expand our reporting
    obligations as early as 2011. As those rules are still being
    developed, at this time we are unable to estimate any capital
    investment that may be required to comply.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to
    our debt portfolio. The majority of our debt portfolio is
    comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of
    fluctuations in interest rates. The maturity of our long-term
    debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of
    our operating assets. In February 2010, we completed a strategic
    restructuring that involved retiring $3 billion of our debt
    and issuing $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of
    senior unsecured notes of WPZ. (See Note 19 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The tables below provide information by maturity date about our
    interest rate risk-sensitive instruments included in continuing
    operations as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Long-term debt
    in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount)
    premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected
    maturity dates. The fair value of our publicly traded long-term
    debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market
    prices. Private debt is valued based on market rates and the
    prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit
    ratings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price
    of natural gas and NGLs, as well as other market factors, such
    as market volatility and commodity price correlations. We are
    exposed to these risks in connection with our owned
    energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts
    and our proprietary trading activities. We manage the risks
    associated with these market fluctuations using various
    derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. The fair
    value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors,
    including changes in energy-commodity market prices, the
    liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts
    are transacted, and changes in interest rates. We measure the
    risk in our portfolios using a

value-at-risk

methodology to estimate the potential

one-day

loss
    from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios.

Value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not
    necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that
    could be incurred from the portfolios. Our

value-at-risk

model uses a Monte Carlo method to simulate hypothetical
    movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result
    of changes in commodity prices, there



is a 95 percent probability that the

one-day

loss
    in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at
    risk. The simulation method uses historical correlations and
    market forward prices and volatilities. In applying the

value-at-risk

methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical
    movements affect the positions or would cause any potential
    liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio
    in response to market conditions could affect market prices and
    could take longer than a

one-day

holding period to execute. While a

one-day

holding period has historically been the industry standard, a
    longer holding period could more accurately represent the true
    market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and
    liquidity constraints.

We segregate our derivative contracts into trading and
    nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. We
    calculate value at risk separately for these two categories.
    Contracts designated as normal purchases or sales and
    nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our
    estimation of value at risk.

Trading

Our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered
    into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity
    price-risk exposure. The fair value of our trading derivatives
    is a net liability of $11 million at December 31,
    2009. Our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes
    was less than $1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Nontrading

Our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that
    hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from
    the following activities:

Segment

Commodity Price Risk Exposure

Exploration & Production

• Natural gas sales

Midstream

• Natural gas purchases

• NGL purchases and sales

Gas Marketing Services

• Natural gas purchases and sales

The fair value of our nontrading derivatives is a net asset of
    $99 million at December 31, 2009.

The value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading
    purposes was $34 million at December 31, 2009, and
    $33 million at December 31, 2008. During the year
    ended December 31, 2009, our value at risk for these
    contracts ranged from a high of $37 million to a low of
    $27 million.

Certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes
    are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Of the total fair value
    of nontrading derivatives, cash flow hedges have a net asset
    value of $178 million as of December 31, 2009. Though
    these contracts are included in our

value-at-risk

calculation, any change in the fair value of the effective
    portion of these hedge contracts would generally not be
    reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects
    earnings.

Trading
    Policy

We have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk
    management activities. These policies cover authority and
    delegation thereof in addition to control requirements,
    authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations.

Value-at-risk

is limited in aggregate and calculated at a 95 percent
    confidence level.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

We have international investments that could affect our
    financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline
    in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates

and/or

the economic conditions in foreign countries.

International investments accounted for under the cost method
    totaled $2 million at December 31, 2009, and
    $17 million at December 31, 2008. These investments
    are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is



not practicable to estimate fair value. We believe that we can
    realize the carrying value of these investments considering the
    status of the operations of the companies underlying these
    investments.

Net assets of consolidated foreign operations, whose functional
    currency is the local currency, are located primarily in Canada
    and approximate 6 percent and 5 percent of our net
    assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These
    foreign operations do not have significant transactions or
    financial instruments denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currency. However, these investments do have the
    potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations
    in these local currencies arising from the process of
    translating the local functional currency into the
    U.S. dollar. As an example, a 20 percent change in the
    respective functional currencies against the U.S. dollar
    would have changed

stockholders’ equity

by
    approximately $98 million at December 31, 2009.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT’S
    ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our internal
    controls over financial reporting are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors
    regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial
    statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. Our internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorization of our management and board of directors; and
    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial
    statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations including the possibility of human error
    and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even
    those systems determined to be effective can provide only
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
    based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our
    assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial
    reporting, as stated in their report which is included in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited The Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    The Williams Companies, Inc.’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, The Williams Companies, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of The Williams Companies, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each
    of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of
    The Williams Companies, Inc. and our report dated
    February 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    The Williams Companies, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
    in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included
    the financial statement schedule listed in the index at
    Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of The Williams Companies, Inc. at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company has changed its reserve estimates and
    related disclosures as a result of adopting new oil and gas
    reserve estimation and disclosure requirements.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The
    Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Description
    of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Operations of our company are located principally in the United
    States and are organized into the following reporting segments:
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream
    Gas & Liquids (Midstream), and Gas Marketing Services
    (Gas Marketing).

Exploration & Production includes natural gas
    development, production and gas management activities primarily
    in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States and oil and natural gas interests in South America.

Gas Pipeline is comprised primarily of two interstate natural
    gas pipelines, as well as investments in natural gas
    pipeline-related companies. Gas Pipeline includes Northwest
    Pipeline GP (Northwest Pipeline), which extends from the
    San Juan basin in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern
    Colorado to Oregon and Washington, and Transcontinental Gas Pipe
    Line Company, LLC (Transco), which extends from the Gulf of
    Mexico region to the northeastern United States. In addition, we
    own a 50 percent interest in Gulfstream Natural Gas System,
    L.L.C. (Gulfstream). Gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system
    extending from the Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in
    Florida.

Midstream is comprised of natural gas gathering and processing
    and treating facilities located primarily in the Rocky Mountain
    and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, oil gathering and
    transportation facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the United
    States, and assets in Canada, consisting primarily of a natural
    gas liquids extraction facility and a fractionation plant.

Gas Marketing primarily supports our natural gas businesses by
    providing marketing and risk management services, which include
    marketing and hedging the gas produced by
    Exploration & Production, and procuring fuel and
    shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids (NGLs) sales for
    Midstream. Gas Marketing also provides similar services to third
    parties, such as producers. In addition, Gas Marketing manages
    various natural gas-related contracts such as transportation,
    storage, related hedges and proprietary trading positions.

Basis
    of Presentation

Prior period amounts reported for Midstream have been adjusted
    for certain contracts involving the purchase and resale of NGLs

and/or

oil
    with the same counterparties that should have been reported on a
    net, rather than gross, basis. The error in presentation
    overstated both

revenues

and

costs and operating
    expenses

by equal amounts and had no impact on

segment
    profit

,

operating income

,

net income

,

net
    cash provided by operating activities

or any other key
    internal measures of operating performance. These adjustments
    reduced previously reported

revenues

and

costs and
    operating expenses

by $295 million in 2008 and
    $99 million in 2007.

Discontinued
    operations

The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes
    reflect the results of operations and financial position of
    certain of our Venezuela operations and our former power
    business as discontinued operations. (See Note 2). Our
    former power business included a 7,500-megawatt portfolio of
    power-related contracts that was sold in 2007 and our natural
    gas-fired electric generating plant located in Hazleton,
    Pennsylvania (Hazleton) that was sold in March 2008, in addition
    to other power-related assets.

Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing
    operations.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Master
    limited partnerships

As of December 31, 2009, we own approximately
    23.6 percent of Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ), including the
    interests of the general partner, which is wholly owned by us,
    and incentive distribution rights. Considering the presumption
    of control of the general partner, we consolidate WPZ within our
    Midstream segment.

As of December 31, 2009, we own approximately
    47.7 percent of the interests in Williams Pipeline Partners
    L.P. (WMZ), including the interests of the general partner,
    which is wholly owned by us, and incentive distribution rights.
    We consolidate WMZ within our Gas Pipeline segment due to our
    control through the general partner.

Our overall ownership in WPZ and WMZ has been impacted by our
    restructuring transactions in 2010. (See Note 19.)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    our corporate parent and our majority-owned or controlled
    subsidiaries and investments. We apply the equity method of
    accounting for investments in unconsolidated companies in which
    we and our subsidiaries own 20 to 50 percent of the voting
    interest, otherwise exercise significant influence over
    operating and financial policies of the company, or where
    majority ownership does not provide us with control due to
    significant participatory rights of other owners.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Significant estimates and assumptions include:

•

Impairment assessments of investments, long-lived assets and
    goodwill;

•

Litigation-related contingencies;

•

Valuations of derivatives;

•

Hedge accounting correlations and probability;

•

Environmental remediation obligations;

•

Realization of deferred income tax assets;

•

Valuation of Exploration & Production’s reserves;

•

Asset retirement obligations;

•

Pension and postretirement valuation variables.

These estimates are discussed further throughout these notes.

Cash and
    cash equivalents

Our

cash and cash equivalents

balance includes amounts
    primarily invested in funds with high-quality, short-term
    securities and instruments that are issued or guaranteed by the
    U.S. government. These have maturity dates of three months
    or less when acquired.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Accounts
    receivable

Accounts receivable

are carried on a gross basis, with no
    discounting, less the allowance for doubtful accounts. We
    estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on existing
    economic conditions, the financial conditions of the customers
    and the amount and age of past due accounts. Receivables are
    considered past due if full payment is not received by the
    contractual due date. Interest income related to past due
    accounts receivable is generally recognized at the time full
    payment is received or collectability is assured. Past due
    accounts are generally written off against the allowance for
    doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been
    exhausted.

Inventory
    valuation

All

inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or
    market. The cost of inventories is primarily determined using
    the average-cost method. We determine the cost of certain
    natural gas inventories held by Transco using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) cost method. LIFO inventory at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, is $7 million and
    $11 million, respectively.

Property,
    plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment

is recorded at
    cost.  We base the carrying value of these assets on
    estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized
    costs, useful lives and salvage values.

As regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco provide
    for depreciation using the straight-line method at Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-prescribed rates. See
    Note 9 for depreciation rates used for major regulated gas
    plant facilities.

Depreciation for nonregulated entities is provided primarily on
    the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, except as
    noted below for oil and gas exploration and production
    activities. See Note 9 for the estimated useful lives
    associated with our nonregulated assets.

Gains or losses from the ordinary sale or retirement of
    property, plant and equipment for regulated pipelines are
    credited or charged to accumulated depreciation; other gains or
    losses are recorded in

other (income) expense — net

included in

operating income

.

Ordinary maintenance and repair costs are generally expensed as
    incurred. Costs of major renewals and replacements are
    capitalized as

property, plant, and equipment —
    net

.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted
    for under the successful efforts method. Costs incurred in
    connection with the drilling and equipping of exploratory wells,
    as applicable, are capitalized as incurred. If proved reserves
    are not found, such costs are charged to expense. Other
    exploration costs, including lease rentals, are expensed as
    incurred. All costs related to development wells, including
    related production equipment and lease acquisition costs, are
    capitalized when incurred.

Depreciation, depletion and
    amortization

is provided under the

units-of-production

method on a field basis.

We record an asset and a liability upon incurrence equal to the
    present value of each expected future asset retirement
    obligation (ARO). The ARO asset is depreciated in a manner
    consistent with the depreciation of the underlying physical
    asset. We measure changes in the liability due to passage of
    time by applying an interest method of allocation. This amount
    is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the
    liability and as a corresponding accretion expense included in

other (income) expense — net

included in

operating income

, except for regulated entities, for
    which the liability is offset by a regulatory asset.

Goodwill

Goodwill

represents the excess of cost over fair value of
    the assets of businesses acquired. It is evaluated at least
    annually for impairment by first comparing our management’s
    estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying
    value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a
    computation of the implied fair value of the goodwill is
    compared with its related carrying value. If the carrying value
    of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of
    that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of
    the excess. We also consider our market capitalization to
    corroborate our estimate of the fair value of the reporting
    unit. We have

goodwill

of approximately $1 billion
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, attributable to our
    Exploration & Production segment.

When a reporting unit is sold or classified as held for sale,
    any goodwill of that reporting unit is included in its carrying
    value for purposes of determining any impairment or gain/loss on
    sale. If a portion of a reporting unit with goodwill is sold or
    classified as held for sale and that asset group represents a
    business, a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill is
    allocated to and included in the carrying value of that asset
    group. None of the operations sold during the periods reported
    represented reporting units with goodwill or businesses within
    reporting units to which goodwill was required to be allocated.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
    estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of
    the reporting unit’s fair value. The use of alternate
    judgments

and/or

assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels
    of impairment charges in the financial statements. Given the
    challenges affecting our businesses and the energy industry in
    2010, we may be required to perform interim assessments of
    goodwill for possible impairment during 2010, which could result
    in a material impairment of our goodwill.

Treasury
    stock

Treasury stock

purchases are accounted for under the cost
    method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded
    as treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance
    of shares are credited or charged to

capital in excess of par
    value

using the average-cost method.

Derivative
    instruments and hedging activities

We utilize derivatives to manage our commodity price risk. These
    instruments consist primarily of futures contracts, swap
    agreements, option contracts, and forward contracts involving
    short- and long-term purchases and sales of a physical energy
    commodity.

We report the fair value of derivatives, except for those for
    which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has been
    elected, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in

derivative
    assets

and

derivative liabilities

as either current
    or noncurrent. We determine the current and noncurrent
    classification based on the timing of expected future cash flows
    of individual trades. We report these amounts on a gross basis.
    Additionally, we report cash collateral receivables and payables
    with our counterparties on a gross basis.

The accounting for the changes in fair value of a commodity
    derivative can be summarized as follows:

Derivative Treatment

Accounting Method

Normal purchases and normal sales exception

Accrual accounting

Designated in a qualifying hedging relationship

Hedge accounting

All other derivatives

Mark-to-market accounting

We may elect the normal purchases and normal sales exception for
    certain short- and long-term purchases and sales of a physical
    energy commodity. Under accrual accounting, any change in the
    fair value of these derivatives is not reflected on the balance
    sheet after the initial election of the exception.

We have also designated a hedging relationship for certain
    commodity derivatives. For a derivative to qualify for
    designation in a hedging relationship, it must meet specific
    criteria and we must maintain appropriate documentation. We
    establish hedging relationships pursuant to our risk management
    policies. We evaluate the hedging relationships at the inception
    of the hedge and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the
    hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly
    effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash
    flows



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. We also
    regularly assess whether the hedged forecasted transaction is
    probable of occurring. If a derivative ceases to be or is no
    longer expected to be highly effective, or if we believe the
    likelihood of occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction is
    no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued
    prospectively, and future changes in the fair value of the
    derivative are recognized currently in

revenues

or

costs and operating expenses

dependent upon the
    underlying hedge transaction.

For commodity derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is reported in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

and
    reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged
    item affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of the
    derivative’s change in fair value is recognized currently
    in

revenues

or

costs and operating expenses

. Gains
    or losses deferred in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

associated with terminated derivatives, derivatives that
    cease to be highly effective hedges, derivatives for which the
    forecasted transaction is reasonably possible but no longer
    probable of occurring, and cash flow hedges that have been
    otherwise discontinued remain in

accumulated other
    comprehensive loss

until the hedged item affects earnings.
    If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction
    designated as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge will not
    occur, any gain or loss deferred in

accumulated other
    comprehensive loss

is recognized in

revenues

or

costs and operating expenses

at that time. The change in
    likelihood is a judgmental decision that includes qualitative
    assessments made by management.

For commodity derivatives that are not designated in a hedging
    relationship, and for which we have not elected the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception, we report changes in fair
    value currently in

revenues

.

Certain gains and losses on derivative instruments included in
    the Consolidated Statement of Income are netted together to a
    single net gain or loss, while other gains and losses are
    reported on a gross basis. Gains and losses recorded on a net
    basis include:

•

Unrealized gains and losses on all derivatives that are not
    designated as hedges and for which we have not elected the
    normal purchases and normal sales exception;

•

The ineffective portion of unrealized gains and losses on
    derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges;

•

Realized gains and losses on all derivatives that settle
    financially other than natural gas derivatives for NGL
    processing activities;

•

Realized gains and losses on derivatives held for trading
    purposes;

•

Realized gains and losses on derivatives entered into as a
    pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement.

Realized gains and losses on derivatives that require physical
    delivery, as well as natural gas derivatives for NGL processing
    activities and which are not held for trading purposes nor were
    entered into as a pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement, are
    recorded on a gross basis. In reaching our conclusions on this
    presentation, we considered whether we act as principal in the
    transaction; whether we have the risks and rewards of ownership,
    including credit risk; and whether we have latitude in
    establishing prices.

Gas
    Pipeline revenues

Gas Pipeline revenues are primarily from services pursuant to
    long-term firm transportation and storage agreements. These
    agreements provide for a demand charge based on the volume of
    contracted capacity and a commodity charge based on the volume
    of gas delivered, both at rates specified in our FERC tariffs.
    We recognize revenues for demand charges ratably over the
    contract period regardless of the volume of natural gas that is
    transported or stored. Revenues for commodity charges, from both
    firm and interruptible transportation services, and storage
    injection and withdrawal services, are recognized when natural
    gas is delivered at the agreed upon delivery point or when
    natural gas is injected or withdrawn from the storage facility.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In the course of providing transportation services to customers,
    we may receive different quantities of gas from shippers than
    the quantities delivered on behalf of those shippers. The
    resulting imbalances are primarily settled through the purchase
    and sale of gas with our customers under terms provided for in
    our FERC tariffs. Revenue is recognized from the sale of gas
    upon settlement of the transportation and exchange imbalances.

As a result of the ratemaking process, certain revenues
    collected by us may be subject to refunds upon the issuance of
    final orders by the FERC in pending rate proceedings. We record
    estimates of rate refund liabilities considering our and other
    third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and other
    risks.

Exploration &
    Production revenues

Revenues from the domestic production of natural gas in
    properties for which Exploration & Production has an
    interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual
    volumes sold during the period. Any differences between volumes
    sold and entitlement volumes, based on Exploration &
    Production’s net working interest, that are determined to
    be nonrecoverable through remaining production are recognized as
    accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate.
    Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement
    volumes are not significant.

Midstream
    revenues

Natural gas gathering and processing services are performed
    under volumetric-based fee contracts, keep-whole agreements and

percent-of-liquids

arrangements. Revenues under volumetric-based fee contracts are
    recorded when services have been performed. Under keep-whole and

percent-of-liquids

processing contracts, we retain the rights to all or a portion
    of the NGLs extracted from the producers’ natural gas
    stream and recognize revenues when the extracted NGLs are sold
    and delivered.

We have olefins extraction operations where we retain certain
    products extracted from the producers’ off-gas stream and
    we recognize revenues when the extracted products are sold and
    delivered to our purchasers. We also produce olefins from
    purchased feed-stock, and we recognize revenues when the olefins
    are sold and delivered.

We also market NGLs and olefins. Revenues from marketing NGLs
    and olefins are recognized when the products have been sold and
    delivered.

Gas
    Marketing revenues

Revenues for sales of natural gas are recognized when the
    product is sold and delivered.

All other
    revenues

Revenues generally are recorded when services are performed or
    products have been delivered.

Impairment
    of long-lived assets and investments

We evaluate the long-lived assets of identifiable business
    activities for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate, in our management’s judgment, that
    the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Except
    for proved and unproved properties discussed below, when an
    indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our
    management’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
    attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets
    to determine whether an impairment has occurred and we apply a
    probability-weighted approach to consider the likelihood of
    different cash flow assumptions and possible outcomes including
    selling in the near term or holding for the remaining estimated
    useful life. If an impairment of the carrying value has
    occurred, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized
    in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the
    assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying
    value exceeds the estimated fair value.

For assets identified to be disposed of in the future and
    considered held for sale, we compare the carrying value to the
    estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if
    recognition of an impairment is required. Until the



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assets are disposed of, the estimated fair value, which includes
    estimated cash flows from operations until the assumed date of
    sale, is recalculated when related events or circumstances
    change.

Proved properties, including developed and undeveloped, are
    assessed for impairment using estimated future undiscounted cash
    flows on a field basis. If the undiscounted cash flows are less
    than the book value of the assets, then a subsequent analysis is
    performed using discounted cash flows. Estimating future cash
    flows involves the use of complex judgments such as estimation
    of the oil and gas reserve quantities, risk associated with the
    different categories of oil and gas reserves, timing of
    development and production, expected future commodity prices,
    capital expenditures, and production costs.

Unproved properties include lease acquisition costs and costs of
    acquired unproved reserves. Individually significant lease
    acquisition costs are assessed annually, or as conditions
    warrant, for impairment considering our future drilling plans,
    the remaining lease term and recent drilling results. Lease
    acquisition costs that are not individually significant are
    aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be
    nonproductive is amortized over the average holding period. The
    estimate of what could be nonproductive is based on our
    historical experience or other information, including current
    drilling plans and existing geological data. A majority of the
    costs of acquired unproved reserves are associated with areas to
    which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed.
    Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas
    is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive
    formation tests, but may be confirmed by our continuing
    development program. Ultimate recovery of potentially
    recoverable reserves in areas with established production
    generally has greater probability than in areas with limited or
    no prior drilling activity. Costs of acquired unproved reserves
    are assessed annually, or as conditions warrant, for impairment
    using estimated future discounted cash flows on a field basis
    and considering our future drilling plans. If the unproved
    properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate
    related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties.

We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate, in our management’s
    judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have
    experienced an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. When evidence of loss in value has occurred,
    we compare our estimate of fair value of the investment to the
    carrying value of the investment to determine whether an
    impairment has occurred. If the estimated fair value is less
    than the carrying value and we consider the decline in value to
    be

other-than-temporary,

the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is
    recognized in the consolidated financial statements as an
    impairment.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
    estimate of undiscounted future cash flows and an asset’s
    fair value. Additionally, judgment is used to determine the
    probability of sale with respect to assets considered for
    disposal. The use of alternate judgments

and/or

assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels
    of impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements.

Capitalization
    of interest

We capitalize interest during construction on major projects
    with construction periods of at least three months and a total
    project cost in excess of $1 million. Interest is
    capitalized on borrowed funds and, where regulation by the FERC
    exists, on internally generated funds as a component of

other
    income — net

. The rates used by regulated
    companies are calculated in accordance with FERC rules. Rates
    used by nonregulated companies are based on the average interest
    rate on debt.

Employee
    stock-based awards

Total stock-based compensation expense for the years ending
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $43 million,
    $31 million, and $70 million, respectively, of which
    $1 million and $9 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, is included in

income (loss) from discontinued
    operations

. Measured but unrecognized stock-based
    compensation expense at December 31, 2009, was
    approximately $44 million, which does not include the
    effect of

estimated forfeitures of $2 million. This amount is
    comprised of approximately $7 million related to stock
    options and approximately $37 million related to restricted
    stock units. These amounts are expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Income
    taxes

We include the operations of our subsidiaries in our
    consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are computed
    using the liability method and are provided on all temporary
    differences between the financial basis and the tax basis of our
    assets and liabilities. Our management’s judgment and
    income tax assumptions are used to determine the levels, if any,
    of valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets.

Earnings
    (loss) per common share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share

is based on the
    sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
    and vested restricted stock units.

Diluted earnings (loss)
    per common share

includes any dilutive effect of stock
    options, nonvested restricted stock units and, for applicable
    periods presented, convertible debt, unless otherwise noted.

Foreign
    currency translation

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as
    their functional currency. These foreign currencies include the
    Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. Assets and liabilities
    of certain foreign subsidiaries are translated at the spot rate
    in effect at the applicable reporting date, and the combined
    statements of operations are translated into the
    U.S. dollar at the average exchange rates in effect during
    the applicable period. The resulting cumulative translation
    adjustment is recorded as a separate component of

accumulated
    other comprehensive loss

.

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
    currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such
    transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result
    in transaction gains and losses which are reflected in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income.

Issuance
    of equity of consolidated subsidiary

Sales of residual equity interests in a consolidated subsidiary
    are accounted for as capital transactions. No adjustments to
    capital are made for sales of preferential interests in a
    subsidiary. No gain or loss is recognized on these transactions.

Accounting
    Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update

No. 2010-06,

“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic
    820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value
    Measurements.” This Update requires new disclosures
    regarding the amount of transfers in or out of Levels 1 and
    2 along with the reason for such transfers and also requires a
    greater level of disaggregation when disclosing valuation
    techniques and inputs used in estimating Level 2 and
    Level 3 fair value measurements. This Update also includes
    conforming amendments to the guidance on employers’
    disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets. The
    disclosures will be required for reporting beginning in the
    first quarter 2010. Also, beginning with the first quarter 2011,
    the Standard requires additional categorization of items
    included in the rollforward of activity for Level 3 inputs
    on a gross basis. We are assessing the application of this
    Standard to disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Subsequent
    Events

We have evaluated our disclosure of subsequent events through
    the time of filing this

Form 10-K

with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25,
    2010.

Discontinued
    Operations

Our Venezuela operations include majority ownership in entities
    that owned and operated the El Furrial and PIGAP II gas
    compression facilities prior to their expropriation by the
    Venezuelan government in May 2009. We previously operated these
    assets under long-term agreements for the exclusive benefit of
    the state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.
    (PDVSA). Construction of these assets was funded through project
    financing that is collateralized by the stock, assets, and
    contract rights of the entities that operated the Venezuela
    assets and is nonrecourse to us. We and the secured lenders are
    pursuing rights available to us under our agreements, including
    contractual and international arbitration. These operations met
    the accounting definition of a component of an entity. As a
    result of the expropriation of the assets and the termination of
    the associated contracts, we consider these assets to be
    disposed and thus qualified for reporting as discontinued
    operations.

Considering the expropriation of the assets and the significant
    controlling rights of the secured lenders, we no longer control
    these entities and no longer meet the criteria to consolidate
    them. In conjunction with the deconsolidation of these entities
    in the second quarter of 2009, we recorded our retained
    investment in these entities at zero and recognized a pre-tax
    gain of $9 million. This carrying value was based on our
    estimates of probability-weighted discounted cash flows that
    considered: (1) alternate arbitration venues,
    (2) estimated levels of arbitration awards, (3) the
    subsequent likelihood and timing of collection, (4) the
    duration of the arbitration process, (5) a discount rate of
    20 percent, and (6) the allocation of arbitration
    proceeds between parties, including the secured lenders. The use
    of alternate judgments

and/or

assumptions would have resulted in a different gain on
    deconsolidation. The carrying value of our retained investment
    in these entities was significantly impacted by our assumptions
    and is not representative of our underlying claims against PDVSA
    or the country of Venezuela.

The expropriations in the second quarter of 2009 followed an
    extended period of nonpayment by PDVSA and default notices that
    we provided in accordance with our agreements. The collection of
    receivables from PDVSA was historically slower and required more
    effort than with other customers due to PDVSA’s policies
    and the political environment in Venezuela. In our year-end 2008
    analysis, we expected PDVSA to resume regular payments following
    a February 15, 2009, referendum vote in Venezuela; however,
    that did not happen. PDVSA’s continued nonperformance
    across the industry, their financial distress, and lack of
    communications with us caused us to revise our assessment in the
    first quarter of 2009.

As a result of this and our first-quarter assessment of the low
    likelihood of PDVSA curing the defaults, we fully reserved
    $48 million of accounts receivable from PDVSA in the first
    quarter of 2009. In addition, we ceased revenue recognition of
    these operations in the first quarter of 2009 as we no longer
    believed that the collectability of revenues was reasonably
    assured. This indicator of impairment required us to review our
    Venezuela property, plant and equipment for recoverability,
    which resulted in recording a $211 million impairment
    charge at March 31, 2009. We estimated this impairment
    charge using probability-weighted discounted cash flow estimates
    that considered expected cash flows from: (1) the continued
    operation of the assets considering a complete cure of the
    default or a partial payment and renegotiation of the contracts,
    (2) the purchase of the assets by PDVSA, and (3) the
    results of arbitration with varying degrees of award and
    collection. Considering the risk associated with operating in
    Venezuela, we utilized an after-tax discount rate of
    20 percent. The use of alternate judgments

and/or

assumptions would have resulted in the recognition of a
    different or no impairment charge. Certain deferred charges and
    credits, which netted to a $30 million charge, were also
    written off because the related future cash inflows and outflows
    were no longer expected to occur.

The past due payments from PDVSA triggered technical default of
    the related project debt under our financing agreements in the
    fourth quarter of 2008, which resulted in classification of the
    entire debt balance as current at December 31, 2008.

The summarized results of discontinued operations primarily
    reflect the results of the above described Venezuela operations
    in 2009 and 2008 and our former power business in 2007, except
    where noted otherwise. The summarized assets and liabilities of

    previously discussed $48 million of bad debt expense
    related to fully reserving accounts receivable from PDVSA and
    the $30 million net charge related to the write-off of
    certain deferred charges and credits. Offsetting these losses is
    a $15 million gain related to our former coal operations.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations before
    (impairments) and gain (loss) on sales, gain on deconsolidation,
    and income taxes

for 2008 includes:

•

$140 million of gains related to the favorable resolution

An $11 million charge associated with an oil purchase
    contract related to our former Alaska refinery;

•

A $10 million charge associated with a settlement primarily
    related to the sale of NGL pipeline systems in 2002.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations before
    (impairments) and gain (loss) on sales, gain on deconsolidation,
    and income taxes

for 2007 includes a gain of
    $429 million (reported in

to
    earnings in second-quarter 2007. This reclassification was based
    on the determination that the hedged forecasted transactions
    were probable of not occurring due to the sale of our power

Income (loss) from investments

in 2009 reflects a
    $75 million impairment charge related to an

other-than-temporary

loss in value associated with our Venezuelan investment in
    Accroven SRL (Accroven). Accroven owns and operates gas
    processing facilities and a NGL fractionation plant for the
    exclusive benefit of PDVSA. The deteriorating circumstances in
    the first quarter of 2009 for our Venezuelan operations (see
    Note 2) caused us to review our investment in
    Accroven. We utilized a probability-weighted discounted cash
    flow analysis, which included an after-tax discount rate of
    20 percent to reflect the risk associated with operating in
    Venezuela. (See Note 14.) Accroven was not part of the
    operations that were expropriated by the Venezuelan government
    in May 2009. We have been engaged in discussions regarding the
    eventual disposition of Accroven.

Impairment of cost-based investments

in 2009 includes an
    $11 million impairment related to our 4 percent
    interest in a Venezuelan corporation that owns and operates oil
    and gas activities. This investment resulted from our previous
    10 percent direct working interest in a concession that was
    converted to a reduced interest in a mixed company at the
    direction of the Venezuelan government in 2006. Considering our
    evaluation of the deteriorating financial condition of this
    corporation, we recorded an

other-than-temporary

decline in value of our remaining investment balance.

The unfavorable change in

interest income and other

in
    2009 and 2008 is primarily due to lower average interest rates.

    acquired unproved reserves resulting from a 2008 acquisition in
    the Fort Worth basin. Additionally, Exploration &
    Production recorded impairment charges of $5 million and
    $143 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to
    properties in the Arkoma basin. Our impairment analysis included
    an assessment of undiscounted (except for the unproved reserves)
    and discounted future cash flows, which considered information
    obtained from drilling, other activities, and year-end natural
    gas reserve quantities.

State income taxes (net of federal benefit) were reduced by
    $46 million in 2008 due to a reduction in our estimate of
    the effective deferred state rate reflective of a change in the
    mix of jurisdictional attribution of taxable income.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes

includes $36 million of foreign loss, and
    $139 million and $127 million of foreign income in
    2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

During the course of audits of our business by domestic and
    foreign tax authorities, we frequently face challenges regarding
    the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions
    regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation
    of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the
    liability associated with our various filing positions, we apply
    the two-step process of recognition and measurement. In
    association with this liability, we record an estimate of
    related interest and tax exposure as a component of our tax
    provision. The impact of this accrual is included within

    $155 million, and $384 million in 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively. Cash tax payments include settlements with
    taxing authorities associated with prior period audits of
    $9 million, $47 million, and $94 million in 2009,
    2008, and 2007, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    $72 million of unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized,
    approximately $61 million, net of federal tax expense,
    would be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense. A

    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We recognize related interest and penalties as a component of
    income tax expense. Total interest and penalties recognized as
    part of income tax expense were $17 million,
    $2 million, and $60 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively. Approximately $93 million and
    $81 million of interest and penalties primarily relating to
    uncertain tax positions have been accrued as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    examination of our consolidated U.S. income tax return for
    2008 is in process. IRS examinations for 1997 through 2007 have
    been completed at the field level but the years remain open for
    certain unagreed issues. The statute of limitations for most
    states expires one year after expiration of the IRS statute.

Generally, tax returns for our Venezuelan, Argentine, and
    Canadian entities are open to audit from 2002 through 2009.
    Certain Canadian entities are currently under examination.

During the next 12 months, we do not expect ultimate
    resolution of any uncertain tax position associated with a
    domestic or international matter will result in a significant
    increase or decrease of our unrecognized tax benefit. However,
    certain matters we have contested to the Internal Revenue
    Service Appeals Division could be resolved and result in a
    reduction to our unrecognized tax benefit.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in which
    all eligible employees participate. Currently, eligible
    employees earn benefits primarily based on a cash balance
    formula. Various other formulas, as defined in the plan
    documents, are utilized to calculate the retirement benefits for
    plan participants not covered by the cash balance formula. At
    the time of retirement, participants may elect, to the extent
    they are eligible for the various options, to receive annuity
    payments, a lump sum payment, or a combination of lump sum and
    annuity payments. In addition to our pension plans, we currently
    provide subsidized retiree medical and life insurance benefits
    (other postretirement benefits) to certain eligible
    participants. Generally, employees hired after December 31,
    1991, are not eligible for the subsidized retiree medical
    benefits, except for participants that were employees of Transco
    Energy Company on December 31, 1995, and other
    miscellaneous defined participant groups. Certain of these other
    postretirement benefit plans, particularly the subsidized
    retiree medical benefit plans, provide for retiree contributions
    and contain other cost-sharing features such as deductibles,
    co-payments, and co-insurance. The accounting for these plans
    anticipates future cost-sharing that is consistent with our
    expressed intent to increase the retiree contribution level
    generally in line with health care cost increases.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The 2009 benefit obligation

actuarial loss

of
    $48 million for our pension plans is primarily due to the
    impact of decreases in the discount rate utilized to calculate
    the benefit obligation. The 2008 benefit obligation

actuarial
    losses

of $126 million for our pension plans and
    $23 million for our other postretirement benefit plans are
    primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rate
    utilized to calculate the benefit obligation as well as changes
    to the mortality assumptions. The other postretirement benefits

plan amendments

of $18 million in 2009 and
    $38 million in 2008 are due to consecutive increases in the
    retirees’ cost-sharing percentage within our subsidized
    retiree medical benefit plans.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, all of our pension plans had
    a projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit
    obligation in excess of plan assets.

The current accounting rules for the determination of

net
    periodic benefit expense

allow for the delayed recognition
    of gains and losses caused by differences between actual and
    assumed outcomes for items such as estimated return on plan
    assets, or caused by changes in assumptions for items such as
    discount rates or estimated future compensation levels. The

net actuarial gain (loss)

presented in the following
    table and recorded in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

and

net regulatory assets

represents the cumulative
    net deferred gain (loss) from these types of differences or
    changes which have not yet been recognized in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income. A portion of the

net actuarial gain

The discount rates for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans were determined separately based on an approach
    specific to our plans. The year-end discount rates were
    determined considering a yield curve comprised of high-quality
    corporate bonds published by a large securities firm and the
    timing of the expected benefit cash flows of each plan.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were
    determined by combining a review of the historical returns
    realized within the portfolio, the investment strategy included
    in the plans’ Investment Policy Statement, and capital
    market projections for the asset classifications in which the
    portfolio is invested and the target weightings of each asset
    classification.

The expected return on plan assets component of

net periodic
    benefit expense

is calculated using the market-related value
    of plan assets. For assets held in our pension plans, the
    market-related value of plan assets is equal to the fair value
    of plan assets adjusted to reflect amortization of gains or
    losses associated with the difference between the expected
    return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets over
    a five-year period. Additionally, the market-related value of
    plan assets may be no more than 110 percent or less than
    90 percent of the fair value of plan assets at the
    beginning of the year. The market-related value of plan assets
    for our other postretirement benefit plans is equal to the
    unadjusted fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the
    year.

The mortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for
    our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are related
    to the experience of the plans and the best estimate of expected
    plan mortality. The selected mortality tables are among the most
    recent tables available.

Plan
    Assets

The investment policy for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans articulates an investment philosophy in accordance
    with ERISA, which governs the investment of the assets in a
    diversified portfolio. The investment strategy for the assets of
    the pension plans and approximately one half of the assets of
    the other postretirement benefit plans include maximizing
    returns with reasonable and prudent levels of risk. The
    investment returns on the approximate one half of remaining
    assets of the other postretirement benefit plans is subject to
    federal income tax; therefore, the investment strategy also
    includes investing in a tax efficient manner. The target
    allocation ranges at December 31, 2009, for the pension
    plan assets were 65 percent to 90 percent equity
    securities, which includes commingled investment funds, and
    10 percent to 30 percent debt securities and cash
    management.

The assets are invested in accordance with the target
    allocations identified previously. Additional target allocation
    ranges are identified for U.S. equities and

non-U.S. equities.

The target allocation ranges at December 31, 2009, were a
    minimum of 45 percent and a maximum of 70 percent for
    U.S. equities and a minimum of 20 percent and a
    maximum of 45 percent for

non-U.S. equities.

The asset allocation ranges established by the investment policy
    are based upon a long-term investment perspective. The ranges
    are weighted toward equity securities since the liabilities of
    the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are long-term
    in nature and historically equity securities have outperformed
    other asset classes over long periods of time.

Equity security investments are restricted to high-quality,
    readily marketable securities that are actively traded on the
    major U.S. and foreign national exchanges. Investment in
    Williams’ securities or an entity in which Williams has a
    majority ownership is prohibited in the pension plans except
    where these securities may be owned in a commingled investment
    fund in which the plans’ trusts invest. No more than
    5 percent of the total stock portfolio valued at market may
    be invested in the common stock of any one corporation. No more
    than 25 percent of stock valued at market may be held in
    any one industry category. No more than 10 percent of the
    total capitalization of any one issuer shall be held in the
    total stock portfolio. The following securities and transactions
    are not authorized: unregistered securities, commodities or
    commodity contracts, short sales or margin transactions, or
    other leveraging strategies. Investment strategies using the
    direct holding of options or futures require approval and,
    historically, have not been used; however, these instruments may
    be used in commingled investment funds.

Fixed income securities are restricted to high-quality,
    marketable securities that include U.S. Treasuries,
    U.S. government guaranteed and nonguaranteed
    mortgage-backed securities, government and municipal bonds, and
    investment grade corporate issues. The overall rating of the
    debt security assets is required to be at least “A,”
    according to the Moody’s or Standard &
    Poor’s rating systems. No more than 5 percent of the
    total portfolio at the time of purchase may be invested in the
    debt securities of any one issuer with the exception of
    U.S. government guaranteed and agency securities.

During 2009, ten active investment managers and one passive
    investment manager managed substantially all of the pension
    plans’ funds and five active investment managers managed
    the other postretirement benefit plans’ funds. Each of the
    managers had responsibility for managing a specific portion of
    these assets and each investment manager was responsible for
    2 percent to 17 percent of the assets.

We believe the pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    have no significant concentrations of risk because of the
    diversity of the types of investments, diversity of the various
    industries, and the diversity of the fund

managers and investment strategies. Generally, the investments
    in the plan are publicly traded, therefore, minimizing liquidity
    risk in the portfolio.

The pension and other postretirement benefit plans participate
    in securities lending programs under which securities are loaned
    to selected securities brokerage firms. The title of the
    securities is transferred to the borrower, but the plans are
    entitled to all distributions made by the issuer of the
    securities during the term of the loan and retain the right to
    redeem the securities on short notice. All loans require
    collateralization by U.S. government securities, cash, or
    letters of credit that equal at least 102 percent of the
    fair value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. There
    are limitations on the aggregate fair value of securities that
    may be loaned to any one broker and to all brokers as a group.
    The collateral is invested in repurchase agreements,
    asset-backed securities, bank notes, corporate floating rate
    notes, and certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2009,
    the fair values of the loaned securities are $63 million
    for the pension plans and $9 million for the other
    postretirement benefit plans and are included in the following
    tables. At December 31, 2009, the fair values of securities
    held as collateral, and the obligation to return the collateral,

Shares of the cash management funds are valued at fair value
    based on published market prices as of the close of business on
    the last business day of the year, which represents the net
    asset values of the shares held.

The fair values of equity securities traded on
    U.S. exchanges are derived from quoted market prices as of
    the close of business on the last business day of the year. The
    fair values of equity securities traded on foreign exchanges are
    also derived from quoted market prices as of the close of
    business on an active foreign exchange on the last business day
    of the year. However, the valuation requires translation of the
    foreign currency to U.S. dollars and this translation is
    considered an observable input to the valuation.

The fair value of all commingled investment funds has been
    estimated based on the net asset values per unit of each of the
    funds. The net asset values per unit of the fund represent the
    aggregate value of the fund’s assets less liabilities,
    divided by the number of units outstanding. Common stocks traded
    in active markets comprise the majority of each commingled
    investment fund’s assets. The fair value of these common
    stocks is derived from quoted market prices as of the close of
    business on the last business day of the year.

The fair value of fixed income securities, except
    U.S. treasury notes and bonds, are determined using pricing
    models. These pricing models incorporate observable inputs such
    as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and

    The treasury notes and bonds are valued at fair value based on
    closing prices on the last business day of the year reported in
    the active market in which the security is traded.

The investment contracts with insurance companies are valued at
    fair value by discounting the cash flow of a bond using a yield
    to maturity based on an investment grade index or comparable
    index with a similar maturity value, maturity period, and
    nominal coupon rate.

In 2010, we expect to contribute approximately $60 million
    to our tax-qualified pension plans and approximately
    $1 million to our nonqualified pension plans, for a total
    of approximately $61 million, and approximately
    $16 million to our other postretirement benefit plans.

Defined
    Contribution Plans

We also maintain defined contribution plans for the benefit of
    substantially all of our employees. Generally, plan participants
    may contribute a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax and
    after-tax basis in accordance with the plans’ guidelines.
    We match employees’ contributions up to certain limits. Our
    matching contributions charged to expense were $25 million
    in 2009, $24 million in 2008, and $22 million in 2007.
    A fund within one of our defined contribution plans is a
    nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). The shares
    held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding when computing
    earnings per share and the dividends on the shares held by the
    ESOP are recorded as a component of retained earnings. There
    were no contributions in 2009, 2008, and 2007 to this ESOP,
    other than dividend reinvestment, as contributions for purchase
    of our stock are no longer allowed within this defined
    contribution plan.

Pursuant to its 2008 rate case settlement, Transco deposits a

Property
    Insurance Changes

As a result of damage caused by recent hurricanes, the
    availability of named windstorm insurance has been significantly
    reduced. Additionally, named windstorm insurance coverage that
    is available for offshore assets comes at significantly higher
    premium amounts, higher deductibles and lower coverage limits.
    Considering these changes, we have reduced the overall named
    windstorm property insurance coverage for our assets in the Gulf
    of Mexico area beginning in the second quarter of 2009. In
    addition, certain assets are no longer covered for named
    windstorm losses, primarily certain offshore lateral pipelines.

Revolving
    Credit and Letter of Credit Facilities (Credit
    Facilities)

At December 31, 2009, we have an unsecured,
    $1.5 billion credit facility with a maturity date of
    May 1, 2012. Northwest Pipeline and Transco each have
    access to $400 million under the credit facility to the
    extent not otherwise utilized by us. We expect that our ability
    to borrow under the credit facility is reduced by
    $70 million due to the bankruptcy of a participating bank.
    Interest is calculated based on a choice of two methods: a
    fluctuating rate equal to the lender’s base rate plus an
    applicable margin, or a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus
    an applicable margin. We are required to pay a commitment fee
    (currently 0.125 percent) based on the unused portion of
    the credit facility. The margins and commitment fee are
    generally based on the specific borrower’s senior unsecured
    long-term debt ratings. Significant financial covenants under
    the credit agreement include the following:

•

Our ratio of debt to capitalization must be no greater than
    65 percent. At December 31, 2009, we are in compliance
    with this covenant.

•

Ratio of debt to capitalization must be no greater than
    55 percent for Northwest Pipeline and Transco. At
    December 31, 2009, they are in compliance with this
    covenant.

We have unsecured credit facilities totaling $700 million,
    which mature in October 2010. These credit facilities provide
    for both borrowings and issuing letters of credit but are
    expected to be used primarily for issuing letters of credit. We
    are required to pay the funding bank fixed fees at a
    weighted-average interest rate of 2.29 percent on the total
    committed amount and interest on any borrowings at a fluctuating
    rate comprised of either a base rate or LIBOR.

The funding bank, an affiliate of Citibank N.A., syndicated its
    associated credit risk through a private offering that allows
    for the resale of certain restricted securities to qualified
    institutional buyers. To facilitate the syndication of these
    credit facilities, the bank established a trust funded by the
    institutional investors. The assets of the trust



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

serve as collateral to reimburse the bank for our borrowings in
    the event that the credit facilities are delivered to the
    investors as described below. Thus, we have no asset
    securitization or collateral requirements under the credit
    facilities. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events,
    letters of credit under the agreement become cash collateralized
    creating a borrowing under the credit facilities. Concurrently,
    the funding bank can deliver the credit facilities to the
    institutional investors, whereby the investors replace the
    funding bank as lender under the credit facilities. Upon such
    occurrence, we will pay:

In second-quarter 2009, two of our unsecured revolving credit
    facilities totaling $500 million expired and were not
    renewed. These facilities were originated primarily in support
    of our former power business.

At December 31, 2009, WPZ has an unsecured
    $450 million credit agreement with a maturity date of
    December 2012. This $450 million credit facility is
    comprised initially of a $200 million revolving credit
    facility available for borrowings and letters of credit and a
    $250 million term loan. WPZ expects that its ability to
    borrow under this credit facility is reduced by $12 million
    due to the bankruptcy of a participating bank. Interest on
    borrowings under this agreement will be payable at rates per
    annum equal to either (1) a fluctuating base rate equal to
    the lender’s prime rate plus the applicable margin, or
    (2) a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus the
    applicable margin. At December 31, 2009, WPZ had a
    $250 million term loan outstanding and no amounts
    outstanding under the $200 million credit facility.
    Significant financial covenants under this credit agreement
    include the following:

•

Williams Partners L.P. is required to maintain a ratio of
    indebtedness to EBITDA (each as defined in the credit agreement)
    of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0. At December 31, 2009, they
    are in compliance with this covenant.

•

Williams Partners L.P. is required to maintain a ratio of EBITDA
    to interest expense (as defined in the credit agreement) of not
    less than 2.75 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.
    At December 31, 2009, they are in compliance with this
    covenant.

At December 31, 2009, no loans are outstanding under our
    credit facilities. Letters of credit issued under our credit

Stockholders’
    Equity

In July 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
    of up to $1 billion of our common stock. During 2007, we
    purchased 16 million shares for $526 million
    (including transaction costs) at an average cost of $33.08 per
    share. During 2008, we purchased 13 million shares of our
    common stock for $474 million (including transaction costs)
    at an average cost of $36.76 per share. We completed our
    $1 billion stock repurchase program in July 2008. Our
    overall average cost per share was $34.74. This stock repurchase
    is recorded in

on our Consolidated Balance

At December 31, 2009, approximately $25 million of our
    original $300 million, 5.5 percent junior subordinated
    convertible debentures, convertible into approximately
    2 million shares of common stock, remain outstanding. In
    2009 and 2008, we converted $28 million and
    $27 million, respectively, of the debentures in exchange
    for 3 million and 2 million shares, respectively, of
    common stock.



THE

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2007, we held all of Williams Partners
    L.P.’s seven million subordinated units outstanding. In
    February 2008, these subordinated units were converted into
    common units of Williams Partners L.P. due to the achievement of
    certain financial targets that resulted in the early termination
    of the subordination period. While these subordinated units were
    outstanding, other issuances of partnership units by Williams
    Partners L.P. had preferential rights and the proceeds from
    these issuances in excess of the book basis of assets acquired
    by Williams Partners L.P. were therefore reflected as

noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries

on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the conversion of the
    subordinated units, these original issuances of partnership
    units no longer have preferential rights and now represent the
    lowest level of equity securities issued by Williams Partners
    L.P. In accordance with our policy regarding the issuance of
    equity of a consolidated subsidiary, such issuances of
    nonpreferential equity are accounted for as capital transactions
    and no gain or loss is recognized. Therefore, as a result of the
    2008 conversion, we recognized a decrease to

noncontrolling
    interests in consolidated subsidiaries

and a corresponding
    increase to

capital in excess of par value

of
    approximately $1.2 billion.

We maintain a Stockholder Rights Plan, as amended and restated
    on September 21, 2004, and further amended May 18,
    2007, and October 12, 2007, under which each outstanding
    share of our common stock has a right (as defined in the plan)
    attached. Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised
    to purchase, at an exercise price of $50 (subject to
    adjustment), one two-hundredth of a share of Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The rights may be
    exercised only if an Acquiring Person acquires (or obtains the
    right to acquire) 15 percent or more of our common stock or
    commences an offer for 15 percent or more of our common
    stock. The plan contains a mechanism to divest of shares of
    common stock if such stock in excess of 14.9 percent was
    acquired inadvertently or without knowledge of the terms of the
    rights. The rights, which until exercised do not have voting
    rights, expire in 2014 and may be redeemed at a price of $.01
    per right prior to their expiration, or within a specified
    period of time after the occurrence of certain events. In the
    event a person becomes the owner of more than 15 percent of
    our common stock, each holder of a right (except an Acquiring
    Person) shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, our
    common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise
    price of the right. In the event we are engaged in a merger,
    business combination, or 50 percent or more of our assets,
    cash flow or earnings power is sold or transferred, each holder
    of a right (except an Acquiring Person) shall have the right to
    receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company
    having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the
    right.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Plan
    Information

On May 17, 2007, our stockholders approved a plan that
    provides common-stock-based awards to both employees and
    nonmanagement directors. The plan generally contains terms and
    provisions consistent with the previous plans. The plan permits
    the granting of various types of awards including, but not
    limited to, restricted stock units and stock options and
    reserves 19 million shares for issuance. At
    December 31, 2009, 30 million shares of our common
    stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to existing and future
    stock awards, of which 11 million shares were available for
    future grants. At December 31, 2008, 33 million shares
    of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to
    existing and future stock awards, of which 16 million
    shares were available for future grants.

Additionally, on May 17, 2007, our stockholders approved an
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) which authorizes up to
    2 million shares of our common stock to be available for
    sale under the plan. The ESPP enables eligible participants to
    purchase our common stock through payroll deductions not
    exceeding an annual amount of $15,000 per participant. The ESPP
    provides for offering periods during which shares may be
    purchased and continues until the earliest of: (1) the
    Board of Directors terminates the ESPP, (2) the sale of all
    shares available under the ESPP, or (3) the tenth
    anniversary of the date the Plan was approved by the
    stockholders. The first offering under the ESPP commenced on
    October 1, 2007 and ended on December 31, 2007.
    Subsequent offering periods are from January through June and
    from July through December. Generally, all employees are
    eligible to participate in the ESPP, with the exception of
    executives and international employees. The number of shares
    eligible for an

employee to purchase during each offering period is limited to
    750 shares. The purchase price of the stock is
    85 percent of the lower closing price of either the first
    or the last day of the offering period. The ESPP requires a
    one-year holding period before the stock can be sold. Employees
    purchased 370 thousand shares at an average price of $13.01 per
    share during 2009. Approximately 1.3 million and
    1.7 million shares were available for purchase under the
    ESPP at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are valued at the date of award, which does not
    precede the approval date, and compensation cost is recognized
    on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
    requisite service period. The purchase price per share for stock
    options may not be less than the market price of the underlying
    stock on the date of grant. Stock options generally become
    exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and
    can be subject to accelerated vesting if certain future stock
    prices or specific financial performance targets are achieved.
    Stock options generally expire ten years after the grant.

The expected dividend yield is based on the average annual
    dividend yield as of the grant date. Expected volatility is
    based on the historical volatility of our stock and the implied
    volatility of our stock based on traded options. In calculating
    historical volatility, returns during calendar year 2002 were
    excluded as the extreme volatility during that time is not
    reasonably expected to be repeated in the future. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant
    Maturity rates as of the grant date. The expected life of the
    option is based on historical exercise behavior and expected
    future experience.

Cash received from stock option exercises was $2 million,
    $32 million, and $56 million during 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively; and the tax benefit realized was
    $1 million, $17 million, and $27 million,
    respectively.

Nonvested
    Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units are generally valued at market value on
    the grant date and generally vest over three years. Restricted
    stock unit expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is generally
    recognized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.

    at December 31, 2009. These grants may be earned at the end
    of a three-year period based on actual performance against a
    performance target. Expense associated with these
    performance-based grants is recognized in periods after
    performance targets are established. Based on the extent to
    which certain financial targets are achieved, vested shares may
    range from zero percent to 200 percent of the original
    grant amount.

Note 14.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Fair value is the amount received to sell an asset or the amount
    paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants (an exit price) at the measurement date.
    Fair value is a market-based measurement considered from the
    perspective of a market participant. We use market data or
    assumptions that we believe market participants would use in
    pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk
    and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation. These
    inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or
    unobservable. We apply both market and income approaches for
    recurring fair value measurements using the best available
    information while utilizing valuation techniques that maximize
    the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs.

The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure
    fair value, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
    measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
    (Level 3 measurement). We classify fair value balances
    based on the observability of those inputs. The three levels of
    the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices for identical assets or
    liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to
    access. Active markets are those in which transactions for the
    asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to
    provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Our
    Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments that
    are exchange traded.

•

Level 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices in
    active markets included in Level 1, that are either
    directly or indirectly observable. These inputs are either
    directly observable in the marketplace or indirectly observable
    through corroboration with market data for substantially the
    full contractual term of the asset or liability being measured.
    Our Level 2 primarily consists of

over-the-counter

(OTC) instruments such as forwards, swaps, and options. These
    options, which hedge future sales of production from our
    Exploration & Production segment, are structured as
    costless collars and are financially settled. They are valued
    using an industry standard Black-Scholes option pricing model.
    Prior to the third quarter of 2009, these options were included
    in Level 3 because a significant input to the model,
    implied volatility by location, was considered unobservable.
    However, due to the increased transparency, we now consider this
    input to be observable and have included these options in
    Level 2.

•

Level 3 — Inputs that are not observable for
    which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or
    liability being measured. These inputs reflect management’s
    best estimate of the assumptions market participants would use
    in determining fair value. Our Level 3 consists of
    instruments valued using industry standard pricing models and
    other valuation methods that utilize unobservable pricing inputs
    that are significant to the overall fair value.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In valuing certain contracts, the inputs used to measure fair
    value may fall into different levels of the fair value
    hierarchy. For disclosure purposes, assets and liabilities are
    classified in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy level
    based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    overall fair value measurement. Our assessment of the
    significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
    requires judgment and may affect the placement within the fair
    value hierarchy levels.

The following table presents, by level within the fair value
    hierarchy, our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
    value on a recurring basis.

Energy derivatives include commodity based exchange-traded
    contracts and OTC contracts. Exchange-traded contracts include
    futures, swaps, and options. OTC contracts include forwards,
    swaps and options.

Many contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in
    the market. Our policy is to use a mid-market pricing (the
    mid-point price between bid and ask prices) convention to value
    individual positions and then adjust on a portfolio level to a
    point within the bid and ask range that represents our best
    estimate of fair value. For offsetting positions by location,
    the mid-market price is used to measure both the long and short
    positions.

The determination of fair value for our assets and liabilities
    also incorporates the time value of money and various credit
    risk factors which can include the credit standing of the
    counterparties involved, master netting arrangements, the impact
    of credit enhancements (such as cash collateral posted and
    letters of credit) and our nonperformance risk on our
    liabilities. The determination of the fair value of our
    liabilities does not consider noncash collateral credit
    enhancements.

Exchange-traded contracts include New York Mercantile Exchange
    and Intercontinental Exchange contracts and are valued based on
    quoted prices in these active markets and are classified within
    Level 1.

Contracts for which fair value can be estimated from executed
    transactions or broker quotes corroborated by other market data
    are generally classified within Level 2. These broker
    quotes are based on observable market prices at which
    transactions could currently be executed. In certain instances
    where these inputs are not observable for all periods,
    relationships of observable market data and historical
    observations are used as a means to estimate fair value. Where
    observable inputs are available for substantially the full term
    of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in
    Level 2. Our derivatives portfolio is largely comprised of
    exchange-traded products or like products and the tenure of our
    derivatives portfolio is relatively short with more than
    99 percent expiring in the next 36 months. Due to the
    nature of the products and tenure, we are consistently able to
    obtain market pricing. All pricing is reviewed on a daily basis
    and is formally validated with broker quotes and documented on a
    monthly basis.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certain instruments trade in less active markets with lower
    availability of pricing information requiring valuation models
    using inputs that may not be readily observable or corroborated
    by other market data. These instruments are classified within
    Level 3 when these inputs have a significant impact on the
    measurement of fair value. The instruments included in
    Level 3 at December 31, 2009, consist of natural gas
    liquids swaps for our Midstream segment as well as natural gas
    index transactions that are used to manage the physical
    requirements of our Exploration & Production and
    Midstream segments.

Fair-value
    methods

We use the following methods and assumptions in estimating our
    fair-value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted
    cash

:  The carrying amounts reported in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value due to the
    short-term maturity of these instruments. Current and noncurrent
    restricted cash is included in

other current assets and
    deferred charges

and

other assets and deferred
    charges

, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

ARO Trust Investments

:  Our
    Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) subsidiary
    deposits a portion of its collected rates, pursuant to its 2008
    rate case settlement, into an external trust specifically
    designated to fund future asset retirement obligations (ARO
    Trust). The ARO Trust invests in a portfolio of mutual funds
    that are reported at fair value in

other assets and deferred
    charges

in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are classified
    as

available-for-sale.

However, both realized and unrealized gains and losses are
    ultimately recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities.

Long-term debt

:  The fair value of our publicly
    traded long-term debt is determined using indicative year-end
    traded bond market prices. Private debt is valued based on
    market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar
    terms and credit ratings. At December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    approximately 97 percent of our long-term debt was publicly
    traded.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Guarantees

:  The

guarantees

represented
    in the following table consist primarily of guarantees we have
    provided in the event of nonpayment by our previously owned
    communications subsidiary, Williams Communications Group
    (WilTel), on certain lease performance obligations. To estimate
    the fair value of the guarantees, the estimated default rate is
    determined by obtaining the average cumulative issuer-weighted
    corporate default rate for each guarantee based on the credit
    rating of WilTel’s current owner and the term of the
    underlying obligation. The default rates are published by
    Moody’s Investors Service. Guarantees, if recognized, are
    included in

accrued liabilities

in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

Other

:  Includes notes and other noncurrent
    receivables, margin deposits, customer margin deposits payable,
    cost-based investments and auction rate securities.

Energy derivatives

:  Energy derivatives include
    futures, forwards, swaps, and options. These are carried at fair
    value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 14 for
    discussion of valuation of our energy derivatives.

Energy
    Commodity Derivatives

Risk
    management activities

We are exposed to market risk from changes in energy commodity
    prices within our operations. We manage this risk on an
    enterprise basis and may utilize derivatives to manage our
    exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows from
    forecasted purchases and sales of natural gas and NGLs
    attributable to commodity price risk. Certain of these
    derivatives utilized for risk management purposes have been
    designated as cash flow hedges, while other derivatives have not
    been designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge
    accounting despite hedging our future cash flows on an economic
    basis.

Exploration & Production produces, buys, and sells
    natural gas at different locations throughout the United States.
    To reduce exposure to a decrease in revenues from fluctuations
    in natural gas market prices, we enter into natural gas futures
    contracts, swap agreements, and financial option contracts to
    mitigate the price risk on forecasted sales of natural gas. We
    have also entered into basis swap agreements to reduce the
    locational price risk associated with our producing basins.
    Exploration & Production’s cash flow hedges are
    expected to be highly



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged
    risk during the term of the hedge. However, ineffectiveness may
    be recognized primarily as a result of locational differences
    between the hedging derivative and the hedged item. Our
    financial option contracts are either purchased options or a
    combination of options that comprise a net purchased option or a
    zero-cost collar. Our designation of the hedging relationship
    and method of assessing effectiveness for these option contracts
    are generally such that the hedging relationship is considered
    perfectly effective and no ineffectiveness is recognized in
    earnings.

Midstream produces and sells NGLs and olefins at different
    locations throughout the United States. Midstream also buys
    natural gas to satisfy the required fuel and shrink needed to
    generate NGLs and olefins. To reduce exposure to a decrease in
    revenues from fluctuations in NGL market prices or increases in
    costs and operating expenses from fluctuations in natural gas
    and NGL market prices, we may enter into NGL or natural gas swap
    agreements, financial forward contracts, and financial option
    contracts to mitigate the price risk on forecasted sales of NGLs
    and purchases of natural gas and NGLs. Midstream’s cash
    flow hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting
    cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of
    the hedge. However, ineffectiveness may be recognized primarily
    as a result of locational differences between the hedging
    derivative and the hedged item.

Gas Marketing Services supports our natural gas business by
    providing marketing and risk management services, which include
    marketing the gas produced by Exploration & Production
    and procuring fuel and shrink for Midstream. Gas Marketing
    Services also enters into forward contracts to buy and sell
    natural gas to maximize the economic value of transportation
    agreements and storage capacity agreements. To reduce exposure
    to a decrease in margins from fluctuations in natural gas market
    prices, we may enter into futures contracts, swap agreements,
    and financial option contracts to mitigate the price risk
    associated with these contracts. Hedges for transportation
    contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are expected to
    be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the
    hedged risk during the term of the hedge. However,
    ineffectiveness may be recognized primarily as a result of
    locational differences between the hedging derivative and the
    hedged item. Hedges for storage contracts have not been
    designated as hedging instruments, despite economically hedging
    the expected cash flows generated by those agreements.

Other
    activities

Gas Marketing Services also enters into commodity derivatives
    for other than risk management purposes, including managing
    certain remaining legacy natural gas contracts and positions
    from our former power business and providing services to third
    parties. These legacy natural gas contracts include
    substantially offsetting positions and have an insignificant net
    impact on earnings.

Volumes

Our energy commodity derivatives are comprised of both contracts
    to purchase the commodity (long positions) and contracts to sell
    the commodity (short positions). Derivative transactions are
    categorized into four types:

•

Fixed price:  Includes physical and financial
    derivative transactions that settle at a fixed location price;

•

Basis:  Includes financial derivative transactions
    priced off the difference in value between a commodity at two
    specific delivery points;

•

Index:  Includes physical derivative transactions at
    an unknown future price;

•

Options:  Includes all fixed price options or
    combination of options (collars) that set a floor

and/or

ceiling for the transaction price of a commodity.

The following table depicts the notional amounts of the net long
    (short) positions in our commodity derivatives portfolio as of
    December 31, 2009. Natural gas is presented in millions of
    British Thermal Units (MMBtu), and NGLs is presented in gallons.

The following table presents the fair value of energy commodity
    derivatives. Our derivatives are presented as separate line
    items in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as current and
    noncurrent derivative assets and liabilities. Derivatives are
    classified as current or noncurrent based on the contractual
    timing of expected future net cash flows of individual
    contracts. The expected future net cash flows for derivatives
    classified as current are expected to occur within the next
    12 months. The fair value amounts are presented on a gross

Credit-risk-related
    features

Certain of our derivative contracts contain credit-risk-related
    provisions that would require us, in certain circumstances, to
    post additional collateral in support of our net derivative
    liability positions. These credit-risk-related provisions
    require us to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of
    credit when our net liability positions exceed an established
    credit threshold. The credit thresholds are typically based on
    our senior unsecured debt ratings from Standard and Poor’s

and/or

Moody’s Investors Service. Under these contracts, a credit
    ratings decline would lower our credit thresholds, thus
    requiring us to post additional collateral. We also have
    contracts that contain adequate assurance provisions giving the
    counterparty the right to request collateral in an amount that
    corresponds to the outstanding net liability. Additionally,
    Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks related to hedging activities. We
    are not required to provide collateral support for net
    derivative liability positions under the credit agreement as
    long as the value of Exploration & Production’s
    domestic natural gas reserves, as determined under the
    provisions of the agreement, exceeds by a specified amount
    certain of its obligations including any outstanding debt and
    the aggregate

out-of-the-money

position on hedges entered into under the credit agreement.

As of December 31, 2009, we have collateral totaling
    $96 million posted to derivative counterparties, all of
    which is in the form of letters of credit, to support the
    aggregate fair value of our net derivative liability position
    (reflecting master netting arrangements in place with certain
    counterparties) of $167 million, which includes a reduction
    of $3 million to our liability balance for our own
    nonperformance risk. The additional collateral that we would
    have been required to post, assuming our credit thresholds were
    eliminated and a call for adequate assurance under the credit
    risk provisions in our derivative contracts was triggered, is
    $74 million.

Cash flow
    hedges

Changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges, to the extent
    effective, are deferred in other comprehensive income and
    reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in
    which the hedged forecasted purchases or sales affect earnings,
    or when it is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction
    will not occur by the end of the originally specified time
    period. As of December 31, 2009, we have hedged portions of
    future cash flows associated with anticipated energy commodity
    purchases and sales for up to three years. Based on recorded
    values at December 31, 2009, $64 million of net gains
    (net of income tax provision of $39 million) will be
    reclassified into earnings within the next year. These recorded
    values are based on market prices of the commodities as of
    December 31, 2009. Due to the volatile nature of commodity
    prices and changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties,
    actual gains or losses realized within the next year will likely
    differ from these values. These gains or losses are expected to
    substantially offset net losses or gains that will be realized
    in earnings from previous unfavorable or favorable market
    movements associated with underlying hedged transactions.

Guarantees

In addition to the guarantees and payment obligations discussed
    in Note 16, we have issued guarantees and other similar
    arrangements as discussed below.

We are required by our revolving credit agreement to indemnify
    lenders for any taxes required to be withheld from payments due
    to the lenders and for any tax payments made by the lenders. The
    maximum potential amount of future payments under these
    indemnifications is based on the related borrowings and such
    future payments cannot currently be determined. These
    indemnifications generally continue indefinitely unless limited
    by the underlying tax regulations and have no carrying value. We
    have never been called upon to perform under these
    indemnifications and have no current expectation of a future
    claim.

We have provided guarantees in the event of nonpayment by our
    previously owned communications subsidiary, WilTel, on certain
    lease performance obligations that extend through 2042. The
    maximum potential exposure is approximately $40 million at
    December 31, 2009, and $42 million at
    December 31, 2008. Our exposure declines systematically
    throughout the remaining term of WilTel’s obligations. The
    carrying value of these guarantees included in

accrued
    liabilities

on the Consolidated Balance Sheet is
    $36 million at December 31, 2009 and $38 million
    at December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2009, we do not expect these guarantees to
    have a material impact on our future liquidity or financial
    position. However, if we are required to perform on these
    guarantees in the future, it may have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations.

Derivative
    assets and liabilities

We have a risk of loss from counterparties not performing
    pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.
    Counterparty performance can be influenced by changes in the
    economy and regulatory issues, among other factors. Risk of loss
    is impacted by several factors, including credit considerations
    and the regulatory environment in which a counterparty
    transacts. We attempt to minimize credit-risk exposure to
    derivative counterparties and brokers through formal credit
    policies, consideration of credit ratings from public ratings
    agencies, monitoring procedures, master netting agreements and
    collateral support under certain circumstances. Collateral
    support could include letters of credit, payment under margin
    agreements, and guarantees of payment by credit worthy parties.

We also enter into master netting agreements to mitigate
    counterparty performance and credit risk. During 2009 and 2008,
    we did not incur any significant losses due to counterparty
    bankruptcy filings.

We determine investment grade primarily using publicly available
    credit ratings. We include counterparties with a minimum
    Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB- or Moody’s
    Investors Service rating of Baa3 in investment grade.

Our eight largest net counterparty positions represent
    approximately 95 percent of our net credit exposure from
    derivatives and are all with investment grade counterparties.
    Included within this group are five counterparty positions,
    representing 64 percent of our net credit exposure from
    derivatives, associated with Exploration &
    Production’s hedging facility. (See Note 11.) Under
    certain conditions, the terms of this credit agreement may
    require the participating financial institutions to deliver
    collateral support to a designated collateral agent (which is
    another participating financial institution in the agreement).
    The level of collateral support required is dependent on

whether the net position of the counterparty financial
    institution exceeds specified thresholds. The thresholds may be
    subject to prescribed reductions based on changes in the credit
    rating of the counterparty financial institution.

At December 31, 2009, the designated collateral agent holds
    $27 million of collateral support on our behalf under
    Exploration & Production’s hedging facility. In
    addition, we hold collateral support, including letters of
    credit, of $25 million related to our other derivative
    positions.

Contingent
    Liabilities and Commitments

Issues
    Resulting from California Energy Crisis

Our former power business was engaged in power marketing in
    various geographic areas, including California. Prices charged
    for power by us and other traders and generators in California
    and other western states in 2000 and 2001 were challenged in
    various proceedings, including those before the
    U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These
    challenges included refund proceedings, summer 2002

90-day

contracts, investigations of alleged market manipulation
    including withholding, gas indices and other gaming of the
    market, new long-term power sales to the State of California
    that were subsequently challenged and civil litigation relating
    to certain of these issues. We have entered into settlements
    with the State of California (State Settlement), major
    California utilities (Utilities Settlement), and others that
    substantially resolved each of these issues with these parties.

As a result of a June 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision,
    certain contracts that we entered into during 2000 and
    2001 may be subject to partial refunds depending on the
    results of further proceedings at the FERC. These contracts,
    under which we sold electricity, totaled approximately
    $89 million in revenue. While we are not a party to the
    cases involved in the U.S. Supreme Court decision, the
    buyer of electricity from us is a party to the cases and claims
    that we must refund to the buyer any loss it suffers due to the
    FERC’s reconsideration of the contract terms at issue in
    the decision. The FERC has directed the parties to provide
    additional information on certain issues remanded by the
    U.S. Supreme Court, but delayed the submission of this
    information to permit the parties to explore possible
    settlements of the contractual disputes. The parties to the
    remanded proceeding have engaged the FERC’s Dispute
    Resolution Service to assist with settlement discussions.

Certain other issues also remain open at the FERC and for other
    nonsettling parties.

Refund
    proceedings

Although we entered into the State Settlement and Utilities
    Settlement, which resolved a significant portion of the refund
    issues among the settling parties, we continue to have potential
    refund exposure to nonsettling parties, such as the counterparty
    to the contracts described above and various California end
    users that did not participate in the Utilities Settlement. As a
    part of the Utilities Settlement, we funded escrow accounts that
    will be used towards satisfying any ultimate refund
    determinations in favor of the nonsettling parties including
    interest on refund amounts that we might owe to settling and
    nonsettling parties. We are also owed interest from
    counterparties in the California market during the refund period
    for which we have recorded a receivable totaling
    $24 million at December 31, 2009. Collection of the
    interest and the payment of interest on refund amounts from the
    escrow accounts are subject to the conclusion of this
    proceeding. Therefore, we continue to participate in the FERC
    refund case and related proceedings.

Challenges to virtually every aspect of the refund proceedings,
    including the refund period, continue to be made. Despite two
    FERC decisions that will affect the refund calculation,
    significant aspects of the refund

calculation process remain unsettled, and the final refund
    calculation has not been made. Because of our settlements, we do
    not expect that the final resolution of refund obligations will
    have a material impact on us.

Reporting
    of Natural Gas-Related Information to Trade
    Publications

Civil suits based on allegations of manipulating published gas
    price indices have been brought against us and others, in each
    case seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are currently
    a defendant in class action litigation and other litigation
    originally filed in state court in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri,
    Tennessee and Wisconsin brought on behalf of direct and indirect
    purchasers of gas in those states.

•

The federal court in Nevada currently presides over cases that
    were transferred to it from state courts in Colorado, Kansas,
    Missouri, and Wisconsin. In 2008, the federal court in Nevada
    granted summary judgment in the Colorado case in favor of us and
    most of the other defendants, and on January 8, 2009, the
    court denied the plaintiffs’ request for reconsideration of
    the Colorado dismissal. We expect that the Colorado plaintiffs
    will appeal, but the appeal cannot occur until the case against
    the remaining defendant is concluded.

•

On October 29, 2008, the Tennessee appellate court reversed
    the state court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claims
    on federal preemption grounds and sent the case back to the
    lower court for further proceedings. We and other defendants
    appealed the reversal to the Tennessee Supreme Court, and we
    expect the court’s ruling in 2010.

•

On December 8, 2009, the Missouri appellate court upheld
    the trial court’s dismissal of a case for lack of standing.
    The plaintiff has appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court.

Environmental
    Matters

Continuing
    operations

Since 1989, our Transco subsidiary has had studies underway to
    test certain of its facilities for the presence of toxic and
    hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if any,
    remediation may be necessary. Transco has responded to data
    requests from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) and state agencies regarding such potential contamination
    of certain of its sites. Transco has identified polychlorinated
    biphenyl (PCB) contamination in compressor systems, soils and
    related properties at certain compressor station sites. Transco
    has also been involved in negotiations with the EPA and state
    agencies to develop screening, sampling and cleanup programs. In
    addition, Transco commenced negotiations with certain
    environmental authorities and other parties concerning
    investigative and remedial actions relative to potential mercury
    contamination at certain gas metering sites. The costs of any
    such remediation will depend upon the scope of the remediation.
    At December 31, 2009, we had accrued liabilities of
    $5 million related to PCB contamination, potential mercury
    contamination, and other toxic and hazardous substances. Transco
    has been identified as a potentially responsible party at
    various Superfund and state waste disposal sites. Based on
    present volumetric estimates and other factors, we have
    estimated our aggregate exposure for remediation of these sites
    to be less than $500,000, which is included in the environmental
    accrual discussed above. We expect that these costs will be
    recoverable through Transco’s rates.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, our Northwest Pipeline GP (Northwest
    Pipeline) subsidiary evaluated many of its facilities for the
    presence of toxic and hazardous substances to determine to what
    extent, if any, remediation might be necessary. Consistent with
    other natural gas transmission companies, Northwest Pipeline
    identified PCB contamination in air compressor systems, soils
    and related properties at certain compressor station sites.
    Similarly, Northwest Pipeline identified hydrocarbon impacts at
    these facilities due to the former use of earthen pits and
    mercury contamination at certain gas metering sites. The PCBs
    were remediated pursuant to a Consent Decree with the EPA in the
    late 1980s and Northwest Pipeline conducted a voluntary

clean-up

of
    the hydrocarbon and mercury impacts in the early 1990s. In 2005,
    the Washington Department of Ecology required Northwest Pipeline
    to reevaluate its previous mercury

clean-ups

in
    Washington. Consequently, Northwest Pipeline is conducting

    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

additional assessments and remediation activities at certain
    sites to comply with Washington’s current environmental
    standards. At December 31, 2009, we have accrued
    liabilities of $8 million for these costs. We expect that
    these costs will be recoverable through Northwest
    Pipeline’s rates.

In March 2008, the EPA issued new air quality standards for
    ground level ozone. In September 2009, the EPA announced that it
    would reconsider those standards. In January 2010, the EPA
    proposed more stringent standards, which are expected to be
    final in August 2010. The EPA expects that new

eight-hour

ozone nonattainment areas will be designated in July 2011. The
    new standards and nonattainment areas will likely impact the
    operations of our interstate gas pipelines and cause us to incur
    additional capital expenditures to comply. At this time we are
    unable to estimate the cost of these additions that may be
    required to meet these regulations. We expect that costs
    associated with these compliance efforts will be recoverable
    through rates.

We also accrue environmental remediation costs for natural gas
    underground storage facilities, primarily related to soil and
    groundwater contamination. At December 31, 2009, we have
    accrued liabilities totaling $8 million for these costs.

In April 2007, the New Mexico Environment Department’s
    (NMED) Air Quality Bureau issued a notice of violation (NOV) to
    Williams Four Corners LLC (Four Corners) that alleged various
    emission and reporting violations in connection with our Lybrook
    gas processing plant’s flare and leak detection and repair
    program. In December 2007, the NMED proposed a penalty of
    approximately $3 million. In July 2008, the NMED issued an
    NOV to Four Corners that alleged air emissions permit
    exceedances for three glycol dehydrators at one of our
    compressor facilities and proposed a penalty of approximately
    $103,000. We are discussing the proposed penalties with the NMED.

In March 2008, the EPA proposed a penalty of $370,000 for
    alleged violations relating to leak detection and repair program
    delays at our Ignacio gas plant in Colorado and for alleged
    permit violations at a compressor station. We met with the EPA
    and are exchanging information in order to resolve the issues.

In September 2007, the EPA requested, and our Transco subsidiary
    later provided, information regarding natural gas compressor
    stations in the states of Mississippi and Alabama as part of the
    EPA’s investigation of our compliance with the Clean Air
    Act. On March 28, 2008, the EPA issued NOVs alleging
    violations of Clean Air Act requirements at these compressor
    stations. We met with the EPA in May 2008 and submitted our
    response denying the allegations in June 2008. In July 2009, the
    EPA requested additional information pertaining to these
    compressor stations and in August 2009, we submitted the
    requested information.

In January 2010, the Colorado Department of Public Health and
    Environment (CDPHE) proposed a penalty of $113,750 against
    Williams Production RMT Company for alleged permit violations at
    four compressor stations in Colorado. We are discussing the
    proposed penalties with CDPHE.

Former
    operations, including operations classified as
    discontinued

We have potential obligations in connection with assets and
    businesses we no longer operate. These potential obligations
    include the indemnification of the purchasers of certain of
    these assets and businesses for environmental and other
    liabilities existing at the time the sale was consummated. Our
    responsibilities include those described below.

Agrico

In connection with the 1987 sale of the assets of Agrico
    Chemical Company, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for
    environmental cleanup costs resulting from certain conditions at
    specified locations to the extent such costs exceed a specified
    amount. At December 31, 2009, we have accrued liabilities
    of $8 million for such excess costs.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

Other

At December 31, 2009, we have accrued environmental
    liabilities of $13 million related primarily to our:

•

Potential indemnification obligations to purchasers of our
    former retail petroleum and refining operations;

•

Former propane marketing operations, bio-energy facilities,
    petroleum products and natural gas pipelines;

•

Discontinued petroleum refining facilities;

•

Former exploration and production and mining operations.

Certain of our subsidiaries have been identified as potentially
    responsible parties at various Superfund and state waste
    disposal sites. In addition, these subsidiaries have incurred,
    or are alleged to have incurred, various other hazardous
    materials removal or remediation obligations under environmental
    laws.

Summary
    of environmental matters

Actual costs incurred for these matters could be substantially
    greater than amounts accrued depending on the actual number of
    contaminated sites identified, the actual amount and extent of
    contamination discovered, the final cleanup standards mandated
    by the EPA and other governmental authorities and other factors,
    but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Other
    Legal Matters

Will
    Price (formerly Quinque)

In 2001, fourteen of our entities were named as defendants in a
    nationwide class action lawsuit in Kansas state court that had
    been pending against other defendants, generally pipeline and
    gathering companies, since 2000. The plaintiffs alleged that the
    defendants have engaged in mismeasurement techniques that
    distort the heating content of natural gas, resulting in an
    alleged underpayment of royalties to the class of producer
    plaintiffs and sought an unspecified amount of damages. The
    fourth amended petition, which was filed in 2003, deleted all of
    our defendant entities except two Midstream subsidiaries. All
    remaining defendants opposed class certification and on
    September 18, 2009, the court denied plaintiffs’ most
    recent motion to certify the class. On October 2, 2009, the
    plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial. We
    are awaiting a decision from the court. The amount of any
    possible liability cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Gulf
    Liquids litigation

Gulf Liquids contracted with Gulsby Engineering Inc. (Gulsby)
    and Gulsby-Bay (a joint venture between Gulsby and Bay Ltd.) for
    the construction of certain gas processing plants in Louisiana.
    National American Insurance Company (NAICO) and American Home
    Assurance Company provided payment and performance bonds for the
    projects. In 2001, the contractors and sureties filed multiple
    cases in Louisiana and Texas against Gulf Liquids and us.

In 2006, at the conclusion of the consolidated trial of the
    asserted contract and tort claims, the jury returned its actual
    and punitive damages verdict against us and Gulf Liquids. Based
    on our interpretation of the jury verdicts, we recorded a charge
    based on our estimated exposure for actual damages of
    approximately $68 million plus potential interest of
    approximately $20 million. In addition, we concluded that
    it was reasonably possible that any ultimate judgment might have
    included additional amounts of approximately $199 million
    in excess of our accrual, which primarily represented our
    estimate of potential punitive damage exposure under Texas law.

From May through October 2007, the court entered seven
    post-trial orders in the case (interlocutory orders) which,
    among other things, overruled the verdict award of tort and
    punitive damages as well as any damages against us. The court
    also denied the plaintiffs’ claims for attorneys’
    fees. On January 28, 2008, the court issued its



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

judgment awarding damages against Gulf Liquids of approximately
    $11 million in favor of Gulsby and approximately
    $4 million in favor of Gulsby-Bay. Gulf Liquids, Gulsby,
    Gulsby-Bay, Bay Ltd., and NAICO appealed the judgment. In
    February 2009, we settled with certain of these parties and
    reduced our liability as of December 31, 2008, by
    $43 million, including $11 million of interest. If the
    judgment is upheld on appeal, our remaining liability will be
    substantially less than the amount of our accrual for these
    matters.

Wyoming
    severance taxes

In August 2006, the Wyoming Department of Audit (DOA) assessed
    our subsidiary, Williams Production RMT Company, additional
    severance tax and interest for the production years 2000 through
    2002. In addition, the DOA notified us of an increase in the
    taxable value of our interests for ad valorem tax purposes. The
    negative assessment for the

2000-2002

time period resulted in additional severance and ad valorem
    taxes of $4 million. We disputed the DOA’s
    interpretation of the statutory obligation and appealed this
    assessment to the Wyoming State Board of Equalization (SBOE).
    The SBOE upheld the assessment and remanded it to the DOA to
    address the disallowance of a credit. We appealed to the Wyoming
    Supreme Court but the court ruled against us in December 2008.
    On April 14, 2009, the Wyoming Supreme Court denied our
    petition for rehearing and issued its mandate affirming its
    prior published decision in this case. We had accrued
    liabilities of $39 million as of December 31, 2008,
    related to this matter representing our estimated exposure,
    including interest, through the end of 2008. During 2009, we
    reduced our accrual for our estimated exposure by
    $6 million, including interest, and made net payments of
    $29 million. While certain issues involved remain to be
    resolved, we do not expect any material future changes from this
    matter and estimate our remaining net exposure, including
    interest, to be approximately $4 million at
    December 31, 2009, all of which has been recorded.

Royalty
    litigation

In September 2006, royalty interest owners in Garfield County,
    Colorado, filed a class action suit in Colorado state court
    alleging that we improperly calculated oil and gas royalty
    payments, failed to account for the proceeds that we received
    from the sale of gas and extracted products, improperly charged
    certain expenses, and failed to refund amounts withheld in
    excess of ad valorem tax obligations. The plaintiffs claim that
    the class might be in excess of 500 individuals and seek an
    accounting and damages. We have reached a final partial
    settlement agreement for an amount that was previously accrued.
    We anticipate trial in 2010 on remaining issues related to
    royalty payment calculation and obligations under specific lease
    provisions. While we are not able to estimate the amount of any
    additional exposure at this time, it is reasonably possible that
    plaintiff’s claims could reach a material amount.

Other producers have been in litigation or discussions with a
    federal regulatory agency and a state agency in New Mexico
    regarding certain deductions used in the calculation of
    royalties. Although we are not a party to these matters, we have
    monitored them to evaluate whether their resolution might have
    the potential for unfavorable impact on our results of
    operations. One of these matters involving federal litigation
    was decided on October 5, 2009. The resolution of this
    specific matter is not material to us. However, other related
    issues in these matters that could be material to us remain
    outstanding.

Other
    Divestiture Indemnifications

Pursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to
    divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain
    purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect
    to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities
    provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions
    and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities
    that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. The
    indemnities generally relate to breach of warranties, tax,
    historic litigation, personal injury, environmental matters,
    right of way and other representations that we have provided.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2009, we do not expect any of the
    indemnities provided pursuant to the sales agreements to have a
    material impact on our future financial position. However, if a
    claim for indemnity is brought against us in the future, it may
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in
    the period in which the claim is made.

In addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are
    pending against us which are incidental to our operations.

Summary

Litigation, arbitration, regulatory matters, and environmental
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties. Were an
    unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a
    material adverse impact on the results of operations in the
    period in which the ruling occurs. Management, including
    internal counsel, currently believes that the ultimate
    resolution of the foregoing matters, taken as a whole and after
    consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage, recovery
    from customers or other indemnification arrangements, will not
    have a material adverse effect upon our future liquidity or
    financial position.

Commitments

Commitments for construction and acquisition of property, plant
    and equipment are approximately $221 million at
    December 31, 2009.

As part of managing our commodity price risk, we utilize
    contracted pipeline capacity primarily to move our natural gas
    production to other locations with more favorable pricing
    differentials. Our commitments under these contracts are as
    follows:

Segment
    Disclosures

Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
    different products and services. The segments are managed
    separately because each segment requires different technology,
    marketing strategies and industry knowledge. Our master limited
    partnerships, Williams Partners L.P. and Williams Pipeline
    Partners L.P., are consolidated within our Midstream and Gas
    Pipeline segments, respectively. (See Note 1.) Other
    primarily consists of corporate operations.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In February 2010, we completed our strategic restructuring that
    will change our reportable segments in first-quarter 2010. (See
    Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Performance
    Measurement

We currently evaluate performance based on

segment profit
    (loss)

from operations, which includes

segment revenues

from external and internal customers,

segment costs and
    expenses, equity earnings (losses)

and

income (loss) from
    investments

. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those described in Note 1. Intersegment sales are
    generally accounted for at current market prices as if the sales
    were to unaffiliated third parties.

The primary types of costs and operating expenses by segment can
    be generally summarized as follows:

•

Exploration & Production — depletion,
    depreciation and amortization, lease and facility operating
    expenses and operating taxes;

•

Gas Pipeline — depreciation and operation and
    maintenance expenses;

•

Midstream Gas & Liquids — commodity
    purchases (primarily for NGL, crude and olefin marketing,
    shrink, feedstock and fuel), depreciation, and operation and
    maintenance expenses;

•

Gas Marketing Services — commodity purchases primarily
    in support of commodity marketing and risk management activities.

Energy commodity hedging by our business units may be done
    through intercompany derivatives with our Gas Marketing segment
    which, in turn, enters into offsetting derivative contracts with
    unrelated third parties. Gas Marketing bears the counterparty
    performance risks associated with the unrelated third parties in
    these transactions. Additionally, Exploration &
    Production may enter into transactions directly with third
    parties under their credit agreement. (See Note 11.)
    Exploration & Production bears the counterparty
    performance risks associated with the unrelated third parties in
    these transactions.

External revenues of our Exploration & Production
    segment are presented net of transportation expenses and
    royalties due third parties on intersegment sales. In some
    periods, transportation expenses and royalties due third parties
    on intersegment sales may exceed other external revenues.

(1)

The 2008 increase in Exploration & Production’s
    total assets is due to an increase in property, plant and
    equipment — net as a result of increased drilling
    activity.

(2)

The decrease in Gas Marketing Services’ total assets for
    2009 and 2008 is primarily due to the fluctuations in derivative
    assets as a result of the impact of changes in commodity prices
    on existing forward derivative contracts. Gas Marketing
    Services’ derivative assets are substantially offset by
    their derivative liabilities.

Note 19.

Subsequent
    Events

Strategic
    Restructuring

On February 17, 2010, we completed a strategic
    restructuring that involved contributing certain of our wholly
    and partially owned subsidiaries to WPZ in exchange for cash and
    WPZ common units. The contributed businesses are currently
    reported within our Gas Pipeline and Midstream segments. The
    aggregate consideration received from WPZ consisted of the
    following:

•

The issuance to us of 203 million WPZ Class C units,
    which are identical to common units, except for a prorated
    initial distribution;

•

An increase in our general-partner’s capital account to
    maintain our 2 percent general-partner interest and the
    issuance of WPZ general-partner units equal to 2/98th of the
    number of WPZ common units issued;

•

Proceeds from the sale of $3.5 billion aggregate principal
    amount of senior unsecured notes of WPZ to qualified
    institutional buyers, net of all expenses incurred by WPZ in
    connection with these transactions.

Utilizing the cash consideration received from WPZ, we retired
    $3 billion of debt and paid $574 million in related
    premiums as well as other transaction costs.

In connection with the issuance of the $3.5 billion
    unsecured notes previously discussed, WPZ entered into
    registration rights agreements with the initial purchasers of
    the notes. WPZ is obligated to file a registration statement for
    an offer to exchange the notes for a new issue of substantially
    identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended, within 180 days from closing and use its
    commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration
    statement to be declared effective within 270 days after
    closing and to consummate the exchange offers within 30 business
    days after such effective date. WPZ may also be required to
    provide a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the
    notes under certain circumstances. If WPZ fails to fulfill these
    obligations, additional interest will accrue on the affected
    securities. The rate of additional interest will be
    0.25 percent per annum on the principal amount of the
    affected securities for the first

90-day

period immediately following the occurrence of default,
    increasing by an additional 0.25 percent per annum with
    respect to each subsequent

90-day

period thereafter, up to a maximum amount for all such defaults
    of 0.5 percent annually. Following the cure of any
    registration defaults the accrual of additional interest will
    cease.

    retired includes:

As part of the restructuring, WPZ, Transco and Northwest
    Pipeline, as co-borrowers, entered into a new $1.75 billion
    three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The full
    amount of the new credit facility is available to WPZ to the
    extent not otherwise utilized by Transco and Northwest Pipeline,
    and may be increased by up to an additional $250 million.
    Transco and Northwest Pipeline each have access to borrow up to
    $400 million under the new facility to the extent not
    otherwise utilized. WPZ utilized $250 million of the new
    credit facility to repay a term loan that was outstanding under
    its previously existing $450 million facility. As WPZ will
    be funding Midstream and Gas Pipeline projects, we reduced our
    $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility that expires May
    2012 to $900 million and removed Transco and Northwest
    Pipeline as borrowers. Our unsecured credit facility that
    expires December 2013 and is used to facilitate our natural gas
    production hedging remains unchanged.

The new credit facility contains various covenants that limit,
    among other things, a borrower’s and its respective
    subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, grant certain
    liens supporting indebtedness, merge or



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

consolidate, sell all or substantially all of its assets, enter
    into certain affiliate transactions, make certain distributions
    during an event of default, and allow any material change in the
    nature of its business.

Under the new credit facility, WPZ is required to maintain a
    ratio of debt to EBITDA (each as defined) of no greater than
    5.00 to 1.00 for itself and its consolidated subsidiaries. For
    Transco and Northwest Pipeline and their consolidated
    subsidiaries, the ratio of debt to capitalization (each as
    defined) is not permitted to be greater than 55 percent.
    Each of the above ratios will be tested quarterly, beginning
    with the second quarter of 2010, and the debt to EBITDA ratio
    will be measured on a rolling four-quarter basis.

Contributed
    Businesses

The contributed Gas Pipeline businesses include 100 percent
    of Transco, 65 percent of Northwest Pipeline, and
    24.5 percent of Gulfstream. We also contributed our
    general- and limited-partner interests in WMZ, which owns the
    remaining 35 percent of Northwest Pipeline. The contributed
    Midstream businesses include significant, large-scale operations
    in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions, a recently
    acquired business in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale region,
    and various equity investments in domestic processing and
    fractionation assets. Our remaining 25.5 percent ownership
    interest in Gulfstream and our Canadian, Venezuelan, and olefins
    operations are excluded from the transaction. Additionally, our
    Exploration & Production business was not included in this
    transaction.

Segment
    Changes

As a result of the restructuring, we will change our segment
    reporting structure to align with the new parent-level focus,
    resource allocation management and related governance
    provisions. Beginning with reporting first-quarter 2010 results,
    our reportable segments will be Williams Partners,
    Exploration & Production, and Other.

Exploration & Production will include the current Gas
    Marketing Services segment, and Other will include the Canadian
    and olefins operations and the 25.5 percent interest in
    Gulfstream, as well as corporate operations.

Stockholders’
    Equity & Noncontrolling Interests

We will account for the change in our ownership interest in WPZ
    as an equity transaction and adjust the carrying amount of
    noncontrolling interest to reflect this change in ownership. As
    a result, we expect our

capital in excess of par value

will decrease with a corresponding increase to

noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries

Results of operations for producing activities consist of all
    related domestic activities within the Exploration &
    Production reporting unit. Amounts for 2008 exclude a
    $148 million gain on sale of a contractual right to a
    production payment on certain future international hydrocarbon
    production.

•

Oil and gas revenues consist primarily of natural gas production
    sold to the Gas Marketing Services subsidiary and includes the
    impact of hedges, including intercompany hedges.

•

Other revenues and other expenses consist of activities within
    the Exploration & Production segment that are not a
    direct part of the producing activities. These nonproducing
    activities include acquisition and disposition of other working
    interest gas and the movement of gas from the wellhead to the
    tailgate of the respective plants for sale to the Gas Marketing
    Services subsidiary or third-party purchasers. In addition,
    other revenues include recognition of income from transactions
    which transferred certain nonoperating benefits to a third
    party. Other expenses also include $15 million write-down
    of costs associated with acquired unproved reserves.

•

Production costs consist of costs incurred to operate and
    maintain wells and related equipment and facilities used in the
    production of petroleum liquids and natural gas. These costs
    also include production taxes other than income taxes and
    administrative expenses in support of production activity.
    Excluded are depreciation, depletion and amortization of
    capitalized costs.

•

Exploration expenses include the costs of geological and
    geophysical activity, drilling and equipping exploratory wells
    determined to be dry holes, and the cost of retaining
    undeveloped leaseholds including lease amortization and
    impairments.

•

Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes depreciation
    of support equipment. Additionally, 2009 includes
    $17 million additional depreciation, depletion and
    amortization as a result of our recalculation of fourth quarter
    depreciation, depletion and amortization utilizing our year-end
    reserves which were lower than 2008. The lower reserves are
    primarily a result of the application of new rules issued by the
    SEC.

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves

(Rule 4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X)

as those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
    geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
    reasonable certainty to be economically producible —
    from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under
    existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government
    regulations — prior to the time at which contracts
    providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates
    that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether
    deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the
    estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have
    commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it
    will commence the project within a reasonable time. Proved
    reserves consist of two categories, proved developed reserves
    and proved undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves are
    currently producing wells and wells awaiting minor sales
    connection expenditure, recompletion, additional perforations or
    borehole stimulation treatments. Proved undeveloped reserves are
    those reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells
    on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively
    major expenditure is required for recompletion. Proved reserves
    on undrilled acreage are generally limited to those that can be
    developed within five years according to planned drilling
    activity. Proved reserves on undrilled acreage also can include
    locations that are more than one offset away from current
    producing wells where there is a reasonable certainty of
    production when drilled or where it can be demonstrated with
    certainty that there is continuity of production from the
    existing productive formation.

•

A significant portion of the revisions for 2009 are a result of
    the impact of the new SEC rules. Proved reserves are lower
    because of the lower 12 month average,

first-of-the-month

price as compared to the 2008 year-end price and the revision of
    proved undeveloped reserve estimates based on new guidance.
    Approximately one-half of the revisions for 2008 relate to the
    impact of lower average year-end natural gas prices used in 2008
    compared to the 2007.

•

Extensions and discoveries in 2009 are higher this year as
    compared to prior years due in part to the expanded definition
    of oil and gas reserves supported by reliable technology and
    reasonable certainty used for reserves estimation.

•

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.73 pounds per square
    inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil reserves are
    insignificant and have been included in the proved reserves on a
    basis of billion cubic feet equivalents (Bcfe).

Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

The following is based on the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves. During 2009 we adopted prescribed accounting revisions
    associated with oil and gas authoritative guidance. Those
    revisions include using the

12-month

average price computed as an unweighted arithmetic average of
    the price as of the first day of each month, unless prices are
    defined by contractual arrangements. These revisions are
    reflected in our 2009 amounts. For the year-ended
    December 31, 2009, the average natural gas equivalent price
    used in the estimates was $2.76 per MMcfe. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the average year-end natural
    gas equivalent prices used in the estimates were $4.41 and $5.78
    per MMcfe, respectively. Future income tax expenses have been
    computed considering applicable taxable cash flows and
    appropriate statutory tax rates. The discount rate of
    10 percent is as prescribed by authoritative guidance.
    Continuation of year-end economic conditions also is assumed.
    The calculation is based on estimates of proved reserves,



which are revised over time as new data becomes available.
    Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the
    future, are not considered. The calculation also requires
    assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved
    reserves, and the timing and amount of future development and
    production costs. Of the $2,833 million of future
    development costs, approximately 60 percent is estimated to
    be spent in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating volumes and
    the value of proved reserves and in projecting future production
    rates and timing of development expenditures. Such reserve
    estimates are subject to change as additional information
    becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the
    timing of production may be substantially different from the
    reserve estimates.

In relation to the new SEC rules, we estimate that the
    standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
    declined approximately $840 million on a before tax basis
    and excluding the overall price rule impact. The significant
    components of this decline include an estimated
    $640 million decrease included in revisions of previous
    quantity estimates and a related $430 million decrease
    included in the net change in prices and production costs,
    partially offset by a $210 million increase included in
    extensions, discoveries and improved recovery, less estimated
    future costs. Additionally, we estimate that a significant
    portion of the remaining net change in price and production
    costs is due to the application of the new pricing rules which
    resulted in the use of lower prices at December 31, 2009
    than would have resulted under the previous rules.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) will prevent
    all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
    are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
    the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty,
    and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
    mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
    individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
    people, or by management override of the control. The design of
    any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
    assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
    be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
    stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of
    the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
    misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
    detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and make
    modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that
    the Disclosure Controls will be modified as systems change and
    conditions warrant.

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
    of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the
    period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed
    under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
    these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable
    assurance level.
