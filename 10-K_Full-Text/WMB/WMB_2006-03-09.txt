GENERAL

We are a natural gas company originally incorporated under the
laws of the state of Nevada in 1949 and reincorporated under the
laws of the state of Delaware in 1987. We were founded in 1908
when two Williams brothers began a construction company in
Fort Smith, Arkansas.

Today, we primarily find, produce, gather, process and transport
natural gas. We also manage a wholesale power business. Our
operations are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, Rocky
Mountains, Gulf Coast, Southern California and Eastern Seaboard.

In 2005 our growth opportunities continued to expand. We are
expanding our natural gas pipelines to meet market demand,
continuing to expand our Exploration & Production
drilling program and continuing to pursue Midstream growth
opportunities especially in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

2005 HIGHLIGHTS

We entered 2005 having completed the key components of our
restructuring plan and in a position to shift our focus to
growth. Our 2005 plan included the following objectives:

Our 2005 income from continuing operations increased to
$317.4 million, as compared to $93.2 million in 2004.
Our 2005 results reflect the benefit of increased natural gas
production and higher net realized average prices, along with
reduced levels of interest expense. Results for 2004 included
$282.1 million in costs associated with the early
retirement of debt, while results for 2005 were reduced by
accruals associated with agreements to resolve gas reporting
issues and impairments of certain investments. Our net cash
provided by operating activities was $1.45 billion in 2005,
comparable with the 2004 level of $1.49 billion. See
Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further
discussion of our 2005 performance. In addition to achieving
these results, the following represent significant actions or
events that occurred during the year:



FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information with respect to each segment’s
revenues, profits or losses and total assets.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Substantially all our operations are conducted through our
subsidiaries. To achieve organizational and operating
efficiencies, our activities are primarily operated through the
following business segments:



•

Other

— consists of corporate operations and
    certain continuing operations previously reported within the
    International and Petroleum Services segments. Other also
    includes our interest in Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P.
    (Longhorn).

This report is organized to reflect this structure.

Detailed discussion of each of our business segments follows.

Power

Our Power business buys, sells, stores and transports energy and
energy-related commodities, primarily power and natural gas.
Since our September 2004 decision to continue operating the
power business and cease efforts to exit that business Power has
focused not only on its objective of maximizing expected cash
flows, but also on executing new contracts to hedge its
portfolio and providing functions that support our natural gas
businesses. Our contracts include physical forward purchases and
sales, various financial instruments and structured
transactions. Our financial instruments include exchange-traded
futures, as well as exchange-traded and

over-the

-counter
options and swaps. Structured transactions include tolling
contracts, full requirements contracts, tolling resales and heat
rate options.

Tolling contracts represent the most significant portion of our
portfolio. Under the tolling contracts, we have the right to
request a plant owner to convert our fuel (usually natural gas)
to electricity in exchange for a fixed fee. We have the right to
request approximately 7,400 megawatts of electricity under six
tolling agreements. The table below lists the locations and
available capacity of each of our tolling agreements. These
capacity numbers are subject to change, and our contractual
rights to capacity may not reflect actual availability at the
plants.

Location

Megawatts

Total

7,358

We use portions of the electricity produced under the tolling
agreements to supply obligations under various arrangements such
as power sales, tolling resales, and full requirements
contracts. Under full requirements contracts, we supply the
electricity required by our counterparties to serve their
customers. Through full requirements contracts, we supply
approximately 1,900 megawatts of electricity to our customers in
Georgia and Pennsylvania.

Through tolling resale agreements, we enter into transactions
that mirror, to varying degrees, some or all of our rights under
our underlying tolling arrangements, which remain in place with
our tolling counterparties. We have resold part of our rights
(2,568 to 3,236 megawatts) under the California tolling
arrangement to two counterparties for periods through 2010.

We also own two natural gas-fired electric generating plants
located near Bloomfield, New Mexico (60 megawatts, Milagro
facility) and in Hazleton, Pennsylvania (147 megawatts).

In 2005, we managed natural gas throughout North America with
total physical volumes averaging 2.3 billion cubic feet per
day. We use approximately 10 percent of this natural gas to
fuel electric generating plants we own or in which we have
contractual rights. We sell approximately 70 percent of
this natural gas to customers including local distribution
companies, utilities, producers, industrials and other gas
marketers. With the remaining 20 percent, we procure gas
supply for our Midstream operations.

In 2004, we substantially exited our crude oil and refined
products activities.



In 2003, we substantially exited our European activities.

Gas Pipeline

We own and operate, through Williams Gas Pipeline Company, LLC
and its subsidiaries, a combined total of approximately
14,600 miles of pipelines with a total annual throughput of
approximately 2,600 trillion British Thermal Units of natural
gas and peak-day delivery capacity of approximately 12 MMdt
of gas. Gas Pipeline consists of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corporation and Northwest Pipeline Corporation. Gas Pipeline
also holds interests in joint venture interstate and intrastate
natural gas pipeline systems including a 50 percent
interest in Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C.

Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation
    (Transco)

Transco is an interstate natural gas transportation company that
owns and operates a

10,500-mile

natural gas
pipeline system extending from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and
the offshore Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South
Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
New Jersey to the New York City metropolitan area. The system
serves customers in Texas and eleven southeast and Atlantic
seaboard states, including major metropolitan areas in Georgia,
North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.
Effective May 1, 1995, Transco transferred the operation of
certain production area facilities to Williams Field Services
Group LLC (Williams Field Services), an affiliated company and
part of the Midstream segment. Effective June 1, 2004 and
due in part to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) Order No. 2004, the operation of the production
area facilities was transferred back to Transco.

Pipeline system and customers

At December 31, 2005, Transco’s system had a mainline
delivery capacity of approximately 4.7 MMdt of natural gas
per day from its production areas to its primary markets. Using
its Leidy Line along with market-area storage and transportation
capacity, Transco can deliver an additional 3.5 MMdt of
natural gas per day for a system-wide delivery capacity total of
approximately 8.2 MMdt of natural gas per day.
Transco’s system



includes 44 compressor stations, five underground storage
fields, two liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage facilities.
Compression facilities at a sea level-rated capacity total
approximately 1.5 million horsepower.

Transco’s major natural gas transportation customers are
public utilities and municipalities that provide service to
residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation end
users. Shippers on Transco’s system include public
utilities, municipalities, intrastate pipelines, direct
industrial users, electrical generators, gas marketers and
producers. One customer accounted for approximately
10 percent of Transco’s total revenues in 2005.
Transco’s firm transportation agreements are generally
long-term agreements with various expiration dates and account
for the major portion of Transco’s business. Additionally,
Transco offers storage services and interruptible transportation
services under short-term agreements.

Transco has natural gas storage capacity in five underground
storage fields located on or near its pipeline system or market
areas and operates three of these storage fields. Transco also
has storage capacity in an LNG storage facility and operates the
facility. The total usable gas storage capacity available to
Transco and its customers in such underground storage fields and
LNG storage facility and through storage service contracts is
approximately 216 billion cubic feet of gas. In addition,
wholly owned subsidiaries of Transco operate and hold a
35 percent ownership interest in Pine Needle LNG Company
LLC, an LNG storage facility with four billion cubic feet of
storage capacity. Storage capacity permits Transco’s
customers to inject gas into storage during the summer and
off-peak periods for delivery during peak winter demand periods.

Transco expansion projects

Central New Jersey Expansion Project

The Central New Jersey Expansion Project, an expansion of
    Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system in
    Transco’s Zone 6 from the Station 210 pooling
    point to a new delivery point on Transco’s Trenton-Woodbury
    Line, was placed into service on November 1, 2005. The
    project adds 105 Mdt/d of new firm transportation capacity,
    which has been fully subscribed by one shipper for a twenty-year
    primary term. The project facilities included approximately
    3.8 miles of pipeline loop. The estimated capital cost of
    the project is approximately $16 million.

Leidy to Long Island Expansion Project

The Leidy to Long Island Expansion Project will involve an
    expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission
    system in Zone 6 from the Leidy Hub in Pennsylvania to Long
    Island, New York. The project will provide 100 Mdt/d of
    incremental firm transportation capacity, which has been fully
    subscribed by one shipper for a twenty-year primary term. The
    project facilities will include pipeline looping in Pennsylvania
    and pipeline looping, uprating and replacement and a natural gas
    compressor facility in New Jersey. The estimated capital cost of
    the project is approximately $121 million. We expect that
    over three-quarters of the project expenditures will occur in
    2007. We filed an application for FERC approval of the project
    in December 2005. The target in-service date for the project is
    November 1, 2007.

Potomac Expansion Project

Transco held an “open season” from July 19
    through August 17, 2005 to receive requests from potential
    shippers for new firm transportation capacity to be made
    available on the Transco pipeline system from receipt points in
    North Carolina to delivery points in the greater
    Washington, D.C. metropolitan area under Transco’s
    proposed Potomac Expansion Project. As a result of the open
    season, the expansion is being designed to create 165 Mdt/d of
    incremental firm transportation capacity, which has been fully
    subscribed by shippers under long-term firm arrangements. The
    estimated capital cost of the project is approximately
    $73 million. Transco filed a request for pre-filing review
    with the FERC on November 10, 2005. The FERC granted the
    request on November 17, 2005. Transco plans to file an
    application for FERC approval of the project during the third
    quarter of 2006. The target in-service date for the project is
    November 1, 2007.



Sentinel Expansion Project

Transco held an open season from October 31 through
    December 2, 2005 to receive requests from potential
    shippers for new firm transportation capacity to be made
    available on the Transco pipeline system under Transco’s
    proposed Sentinel Expansion Project. During the open season, we
    received requests for a total of 256 Mdt/d of incremental
    firm transportation capacity from the Leidy Hub in Clinton
    County, Pennsylvania and/or the Pleasant Valley Interconnection
    with Cove Point LNG, LP in Fairfax County, Virginia to various
    delivery points requested by the shippers. Transco is evaluating
    the facilities required to support such requested capacity. The
    final project size, location of facilities and capital cost will
    depend on the outcome of that evaluation and the level of firm
    market commitment confirmed with the requesting parties. The
    proposed in-service date for the project is November 1,
    2008.

Operating statistics

The following table summarizes transportation data for the
Transco system for the periods indicated:

Transco’s facilities are divided into eight rate zones.
Five are located in the production area, and three are located
in the market area. Long-haul transportation involves gas that
Transco receives in one of the production-area zones and
delivers to a market-area zone. Market-area transportation
involves gas that Transco both receives and delivers within the
market-area zones. Production-area transportation involves gas
that Transco both receives and delivers within the
production-area zones.

Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest Pipeline)

Northwest Pipeline is an interstate natural gas transportation
company that owns and operates a natural gas pipeline system
extending from the San Juan basin in northwestern New
Mexico and southwestern Colorado through Colorado, Utah,
Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington to a point on the Canadian
border near Sumas, Washington. Northwest Pipeline provides
services for markets in California, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah,
Nevada, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington directly or
indirectly through interconnections with other pipelines.

Pipeline system and customers

At December 31, 2005, Northwest Pipeline’s system,
having long-term firm transportation agreements with peaking
capacity of approximately 3.4 MMdt of natural gas per day,
was composed of approximately 4,100 miles of mainline and
lateral transmission pipelines and 42 transmission compressor
stations having a combined sea level-rated capacity of
approximately 462,000 horsepower.

In December 2003, we received an Amended Corrective Action Order
(ACAO) from the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) regarding a
segment of one of our natural gas pipelines in western
Washington. The pipeline experienced two breaks in 2003 and we
subsequently idled the pipeline segment until its integrity
could be assured.



By June 2004 we had successfully completed our hydrostatic
testing program and returned to service 111 miles of the
268 miles of pipe affected by the ACAO. That effort has
restored 131 Mdt/d of the 360 Mdt/d of idled capacity
and is anticipated to be adequate to meet most market
conditions. To date our ability to serve the market demand has
not been significantly impacted.

The restored facilities will be monitored and tested as
necessary until they are ultimately replaced in 2006. Through
December 31, 2005, approximately $43.3 million has
been spent on testing and remediation costs, including
approximately $8.9 million related to one segment of pipe
that we determined not to return to service and was therefore
written off in the second quarter of 2004.

As required by OPS, we plan to replace all capacity associated
with the segment affected by the ACAO by November 2006 to meet
long-term demands. We conducted a reverse open season to
determine whether any existing customers were willing to
relinquish or reduce their capacity commitments to allow us to
reduce the scope of pipeline replacement facilities. That
resulted in 13 Mdt/d of capacity being relinquished and
incorporated into the replacement project.

On November 29, 2004, we filed an application with the FERC
for certificate authorization to construct and operate the
“Capacity Replacement Project.” This project entails
the abandonment of approximately 268 miles of the existing

26-inch

pipeline, and
the construction of approximately 80 miles of new

36-inch

pipeline and an
additional 10,760 net horsepower of compression at two
existing compressor stations. The original cost of the abandoned
assets and any cost of removal, net of salvage, will be charged
to Accumulated Depreciation. At December 31, 2005, the net
book value of the assets to be abandoned was $82.4 million.
The estimated total cost of the proposed Capacity Replacement
Project included in the filing is approximately
$333 million, net of a $3.3 million

contribution-in

-aid-of

-construction
from a shipper that agreed to relinquish 13 Mdt/d of
capacity. A favorable preliminary determination was issued in
May 2005 and we received and accepted the final FERC certificate
in September 2005. We began construction of certain critical
river crossings in late 2005. The main construction of pipeline
and compression will begin in early 2006 with an anticipated
in-service date of November 1, 2006.

We anticipate filing a rate case to recover the capitalized
costs relating to restoration and replacement facilities to
become effective following the in-service date of the
replacement facilities.

In 2005, Northwest Pipeline served a total of 143 transportation
and storage customers. Transportation customers include
distribution companies, municipalities, interstate and
intrastate pipelines, gas marketers and direct industrial users.
The two largest customers of Northwest Pipeline in 2005
accounted for approximately 17.6 percent and
11.0 percent, of its total operating revenues. No other
customer accounted for more than 10 percent of Northwest
Pipeline’s total operating revenues in 2005. Northwest
Pipeline’s firm transportation agreements are generally
long-term agreements with various expiration dates and account
for the major portion of Northwest Pipeline’s business.
Additionally, Northwest Pipeline offers interruptible and
short-term firm transportation service.

As a part of its transportation services, Northwest Pipeline
utilizes underground storage facilities in Utah and Washington
enabling it to balance daily receipts and deliveries. Northwest
Pipeline also owns and operates an LNG storage facility in
Washington that provides service for customers during a few days
of extreme demands. These storage facilities have an aggregate
firm delivery capacity of approximately 600 million cubic
feet of gas per day.

Northwest Pipeline expansion projects

Colorado gas pipeline expansion

In January 2006, we filed an application with the FERC to
    construct a

38-mile

expansion that would provide additional capacity in northwest
    Colorado. The planned expansion would increase capacity by
    450 Mdt/d through the

30-inch

diameter line
    and is estimated to cost $55 million. We are currently in
    discussions with shippers to determine the level of commitment
    and anticipate beginning service on the expansion in January
    2007.

    does not involve the construction of additional mainline
    capacity.

Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream)

Gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system extending from the
Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in Florida. In December
2001, Gulfstream filed an application with the FERC to allow
Gulfstream to complete the construction of its approved
facilities in phases. In May 2002, the first phase of the
project was placed into service at a cost of approximately
$1.5 billion. The second phase of the project was placed
into service on February 1, 2005. The total capital cost of
both phases of the project is approximately $1.7 billion.
At December 31, 2005, our investment in Gulfstream was
$395 million. Gas Pipeline and Duke Energy, through their
respective subsidiaries, each hold a 50 percent ownership
interest in Gulfstream and provide operating services for
Gulfstream.

Gulfstream expansion projects

Gulfstream has entered into a conditional agreement pursuant to
which, subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory
approvals and other conditions precedent therein, we intend to
further expand the system and fully subscribe the existing
pipeline system on a long-term basis. The estimated capital cost
of this expansion project, if implemented, is anticipated to be
approximately $135 million. In addition, we are pursuing
another potential prospect for an expansion. Such expansion, if
successful, would require estimated capital costs of not less
than $100 million, and would expand the current mainline
capacity of 1.1 million Dth per day to at least
1.25 million Dth per day. Implementation of our two
proposed expansion projects may require additional compression
at Station 100 in Coden, Alabama, and new compression facilities
at Station 200 in Florida. No significant increase in operations
personnel is expected as a result of our two proposed expansion
projects.

Exploration & Production

Our Exploration & Production segment, which is
comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned
subsidiaries, including Williams Production Company LLC and
Williams Production RMT Company (RMT), produces, develops, and
manages natural gas reserves primarily located in the Rocky
Mountain (primarily New Mexico, Wyoming and Colorado) and
Mid-Continent (Oklahoma and Texas) regions of the United States.
We specialize in natural gas production from tight-sands
formations and coal bed methane reserves in the Piceance,
San Juan, Powder River, Arkoma, Green River and
Fort Worth basins. Over 99 percent of
Exploration & Production’s domestic reserves are
natural gas. Our Exploration & Production segment also
has international oil and gas interests, which include a
69 percent equity interest in Apco Argentina, Inc. (Apco
Argentina), an oil and gas exploration and production company
with operations in Argentina, and a 10 percent interest in
the La Concepcion area located in western Venezuela.



Exploration & Production’s primary strategy is to
utilize its expertise in the development of tight-sands and coal
bed methane reserves. Exploration & Production’s
current proved undeveloped and probable reserves provide us with
strong capital investment opportunities for several years into
the future. Exploration & Production’s goal is to
drill its existing proved undeveloped reserves, which comprise
over 51 percent of proved reserves and to drill in areas of
probable reserves. In addition, Exploration &
Production provides a significant amount of equity production
that is gathered and/or processed by our Midstream facilities in
the San Juan basin.

Information for our Exploration & Production segment
relates only to domestic activity unless otherwise noted. We use
the terms “gross” to refer to all wells or acreage in
which we have at least a partial working interest and
“net” to refer to our ownership represented by that
working interest.

Oil and gas properties

Rocky Mountain properties

The Piceance basin is located in northwestern Colorado, where we
primarily target tight sands reserves, and is our largest area
of concentrated development comprising approximately
64 percent of our proved reserves at December 31,
2005. This area has approximately 1,400 undrilled proved
locations in inventory. Within this basin, we are also the owner
and operator of a natural gas gathering system. In 2005, we
drilled 320 gross wells and produced a net of approximately
116 Bcfe of natural gas from the Piceance basin. Our
estimated proved reserves in the Piceance basin at year-end 2005
were 2,155 Bcfe. In March 2005 we entered into a contract
with Helmerich & Payne (NYSE: HP) for the
operation of 10 new
FlexRig

®

drilling rigs, each for a term of three years.

The San Juan basin is located in northwest New Mexico and
southwest Colorado. In 2005, we participated in the drilling of
189 gross wells, of which we operate 52, and produced a net
of approximately 55 Bcfe from the San Juan basin. Our
estimated proved reserves in the San Juan basin at year-end
2005 were 663 Bcfe.

Located in northeast Wyoming, the Powder River basin includes
large areas with multiple coal seam potential, targeting thick
coal bed methane formations at shallow depths. We operate
approximately 2,780 wells in the basin and have an interest
in approximately 2,504 additional wells. We have a significant
inventory of undrilled locations, providing long-term drilling
opportunities. In 2005, we participated in the drilling of
960 gross wells from this basin, of which we operate 400,
and produced a net of approximately 42 Bcfe of natural gas.
Our estimated proved reserves in the Powder River basin at
year-end 2005 were 346 Bcfe.

Mid-Continent properties

In 2005, we drilled 75 gross wells, of which we operate 49,
in the southeastern Oklahoma portion of the Arkoma basin and the
Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth basin of Texas. We produced
a net of approximately 7 Bcfe of natural gas in 2005 and
our estimated proved reserves in the Arkoma and Fort Worth
basins at year-end 2005 were 147 Bcfe.

No major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has
caused a significant change in estimated gas reserves since
year-end 2005. We have not filed on a recurring basis estimates
of our total proved net oil and gas reserves with any
U.S. regulatory authority or agency other than the
Department of Energy (DOE) and the SEC. The estimates
furnished to the DOE have been consistent with those furnished
to the SEC, although Exploration & Production has not
yet filed any information with respect to its estimated total
reserves at December 31, 2005, with the DOE. Certain
estimates filed with the DOE may not necessarily be directly
comparable due to special DOE reporting requirements, such as
the requirement to report gross operated reserves only. The
underlying estimated reserves for the DOE did not differ by more
than five percent from the underlying estimated reserves
utilized in preparing the estimated reserves reported to the SEC.

Approximately 97 percent of our year-end 2005 United States
proved reserves estimates were audited in each separate basin by
Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI). When
compared on a well-by-well basis, some of our estimates are
greater and some are less than the estimates of NSAI. However,
in the opinion of NSAI, the estimates of our proved reserves are
in the aggregate reasonable by basin and have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and
evaluation principles. These principles are set forth in the
Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and
Gas Reserve Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum
Engineers. NSAI is satisfied with our methods and procedures in
preparing the December 31, 2005 reserve estimates and saw
nothing of an unusual nature that would cause NSAI to take
exception with the estimates, in the aggregate, as prepared by
us. Reserves estimates related to properties underlying the
Williams Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust which comprise another
approximately two percent of our total U.S. proved
reserves were prepared by Miller and Lents, LTD.

Operating statistics

We focus on lower-risk development drilling. Our drilling
success rate was 99 percent in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The
following tables summarize domestic drilling activity by number
and type of well for the periods indicated:

Substantially all our natural gas production is currently being
sold to Power at prevailing market prices. Because we currently
have a low-risk drilling program in proven basins, the main
component of risk that we manage is price risk.
Exploration & Production natural gas hedges for 2006
consist of derivative contracts with Power that hedge 299
BBtud in fixed price hedges (whole year) and approximately
115 BBtud in NYMEX and regional collars for January through
March for projected 2006 domestic natural gas production. Power
then enters into offsetting derivative contracts with unrelated
third parties. Our natural gas production hedges in 2005
consisted of 286 BBtud in fixed price hedges, 50 BBtud
in NYMEX collars and an additional 50 BBtud in regional
collars for the fourth quarter only. Hedging decisions are made
considering the overall Williams commodity risk exposure and are
not executed independently by Exploration & Production;
there are gas purchase hedging contracts executed on behalf of
other Williams entities which taken as a net position may
counteract Exploration & Production gas sales hedging
derivatives.

Acquisitions & Divestitures

Exploration & Production acquired an acreage position
in the Forth Worth basin in north-central Texas, that includes
26.9 Bcf of proved reserves as of year end 2005. Our entry
into this basin allows us to own an operated position that has
potential for significant growth. It increases our
diversification into the Mid-continent region and allows us to
use our horizontal drilling expertise to develop wells in the
Barnett Shale formation.

We sold certain non-core assets in the Wyoming Powder River
basin that include approximately 9.6 Bcf of proved
reserves. These assets are outside of our main area of
development in the basin and are operated by third parties.

Other information

In 1993, Exploration & Production conveyed a net
profits interest in certain of its properties to the Williams
Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust. Substantially all of the production
attributable to the properties conveyed to the trust was from
the Fruitland coal formation and constituted coal seam gas. We
subsequently



sold trust units to the public in an underwritten public
offering and retained 3,568,791 trust units then representing
36.8 percent of outstanding trust units. We have continued
to sell trust units on the open market and as of March 1,
2006, we own 789,291 trust units.

International exploration and production interests

We also have investments in international oil and gas interests,
principally through our approximately 69 percent interest
in Apco Argentina. If combined with our domestic proved
reserves, our international interests would make up
6.1 percent of our total proved reserves.

Midstream

Our Midstream segment, one of the nation’s largest natural
gas gatherers and processors, has primary service areas
concentrated in the major producing basins of San Juan,
Wyoming, the Gulf of Mexico, Venezuela and western Canada. Our
primary businesses — natural gas gathering, treating,
and processing; natural gas liquids (NGL) fractionation,
storage and transportation; and oil transportation —
fall within the middle of the process of taking natural gas and
crude oil from the wellhead to the consumer. NGLs, ethylene and
propylene are extracted/produced at our plants. These products
are used primarily for the manufacture of plastics, home heating
and refinery feedstock.

Although most of our gas services are performed for a
volumetric-based fee, a portion of our gas processing contracts
are commodity-based and include two distinct types of commodity
exposure. The first type includes “Keep Whole”
processing contracts whereby we own the NGLs extracted and
replace the lost heating value with natural gas. Under these
contracts, we are exposed to the spread between NGLs and natural
gas prices. The second type consists of “Percent of
Liquids” contracts whereby we receive a portion of the
extracted liquids with no exposure to the price of natural gas.
Under these contracts, we are only exposed to NGL price
movements.

Our Canadian and Gulf Liquids olefin facilities have an exposure
similar to our “Keep Whole” contracts. We are exposed
to the spread between the price for natural gas and the products
we produce. In the Gulf Coast, our feedstock for the ethane
cracker is ethane and propane; as a result, we are exposed to
the price spread between ethane and propane and ethylene and
propylene.

Key variables for our business will continue to be:

•

revenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either
    completed or currently under construction;

•

disciplined growth in our core service areas;

•

prices impacting our commodity-based processing and olefin
    activities.

Domestic gathering and processing

Geographically, our Midstream natural gas assets are positioned
to maximize commercial and operational synergies with our other
assets. For example, most of our offshore gathering and
processing assets attach and process or condition natural gas
supplies delivered to the Transco pipeline. Also, our gathering
and processing facilities in the San Juan basin handle
about 80 percent of our Exploration & Production
group’s wellhead production in this basin. Several of our
western gathering systems serve as critical sources of supply
for Northwest Pipeline customers.

We own and/or operate domestic gas gathering and processing
assets primarily within the western states of Wyoming, Colorado
and New Mexico, and the onshore and offshore shelf and deepwater
areas in and around the Gulf Coast states of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama. These assets consist of approximately
8,100 miles of gathering pipelines, nine processing plants
(one partially owned) and six natural gas treating plants with a
combined daily inlet capacity in excess of 5.8 billion
cubic feet per day. In addition to these natural gas assets, we
own and operate three crude oil pipelines totaling approximately
270 miles with a capacity of more than 300,000 barrels
per day. This includes our Mountaineer crude oil pipeline in the



deepwater Gulf of Mexico that serves the Dominion
Exploration & Production-operated Devils Tower field.

See Gathering and processing — deepwater projects
below.

Included in the natural gas assets listed above are the assets
of Discovery Producer Services LLC and its subsidiary Discovery
Gas Transmission Services LLC (Discovery). We own a partial
interest in Discovery and operate its facilities.
Discovery’s assets include a cryogenic natural gas
processing plant near Larose, Louisiana, a natural gas liquids
fractionator plant near Paradis, Louisiana and an offshore
natural gas gathering and transportation system.

Effective June 1, 2004, and due in part to our response to
FERC Order 2004, management, operations and decision-making
control of certain regulated gathering assets in the Midstream
segment were transferred to the Gas Pipeline segment. These
assets are owned by Transco, but prior to this change were
commercially and physically operated by Midstream. We also
requested and were granted a partial waiver allowing us to
continue to manage and operate the Discovery Gas Transmission
and Black Marlin assets. In order to comply with the remaining
provisions of the FERC order, we determined it was necessary to
transfer the management of our equity investment in the Aux
Sable processing plant to Power. This transfer was effective
September 21, 2004.

Gulf Coast petrochemical and olefins

We own a 5/12 interest in and are the operator for an ethane
cracker at Geismar, Louisiana, with a total production capacity
of 1.3 billion pounds per year of ethylene. During the
fourth quarter of 2004, we closed on the sale of our interest in
an associated ethane/ethylene storage and transportation complex
located in Choctaw, Louisiana. We continue to own a ethane
pipeline system in Louisiana.

Our Gulf Liquids New River LLC (Gulf Liquids) business consisted
of two refinery off-gas processing facilities, an olefins
fractionator and propylene splitter and connecting pipeline
systems in Louisiana. During the third quarter of 2005, we
completed the sale of the olefins fractionator and the related
pipeline system. We continue to own and operate the propylene
splitter and its related pipeline system.

Venezuela

Our Venezuelan investments involve gas compression and gas
processing and natural gas liquids fractionation operations. We
own controlling interests in three gas compressor facilities
which provide roughly 65 percent of the gas injections in
eastern Venezuela. These facilities help stabilize the reservoir
and enhance the recovery of crude oil by re-injecting natural
gas at high pressures. We also own a 49.25 percent interest
in two 400 MMcf/d natural gas liquids extraction plants, a
50,000 barrels per day natural gas liquids fractionation
plant and associated storage and refrigeration facilities.

Canada

Our Canadian operations include an olefin liquids extraction
plant located near Ft. McMurray, Alberta and an olefin
fractionation facility near Edmonton, Alberta. These facilities
extract olefinic liquids from the off-gas produced from oil
sands bitumen upgrading and then fractionate, treat, store and
terminal the propane, propylene, butane and condensate recovered
from this process. We continue to be the only olefins
fractionator in Western Canada and the only treater/processor of
oil sands off-gas. These operations extract valuable
petrochemical feedstocks from tar sands refinery off-gas streams
allowing our customers to burn cleaner natural gas streams and
reduce overall air emissions. The extraction plant has
processing capacity in excess of 100 MMcf/d with the
ability to recover in excess of 15 Mbbls/d of NGL products.

We sold our three straddle plants in western Canada to Inter
Pipeline Fund of Calgary on July 28, 2004. The sale
included our 100 percent ownership interest in the Cochrane
and Empress II plants, and our 50 percent interest in
the Empress V facility.



Other

We own interests in and/or operate NGL fractionation and storage
assets. These assets include two partially owned NGL
fractionation facilities near McPherson, Kansas and Baton Rouge,
Louisiana that have a combined capacity in excess of
167,000 barrels per day. We also own approximately
20 million barrels of NGL storage capacity in central
Kansas.

Williams Partners L.P.

Williams Partners L.P. (Williams Partners) was formed to engage
in the business of gathering, transporting and processing
natural gas and fractionating and storing NGLs. We own
approximately 60 percent of Williams Partners. Williams
Partners provides us with an acquisition currency that is
expected to enable growth of our midstream business. Williams
Partners also creates a vehicle to monetize our qualifying
assets through sales. Such sales, which are subject to approval
by both our and Williams Partners’ general partner’s
board of directors, allow us to retain control of the assets
through our ownership interest in Williams Partners.

Williams Partners owns a 40 percent equity investment in
the Discovery gathering, transportation, processing and NGL
fractionation system; the Carbonate Trend sour gas gathering
pipeline; three integrated NGL storage facilities near Conway,
Kansas; and a 50 percent interest in an NGL fractionator
near Conway, Kansas.

Expansion projects

Gathering and processing

In the first quarter of 2004, we began processing additional gas
volumes at our Opal processing plant following an expansion
completed by Willbros Mt. West, Inc., a business unit of
Willbros Group, Inc. The new volumes are being produced by
affiliates of Shell Exploration & Production Company in
southwestern Wyoming’s Pinedale Anticline and other area
producers. This expansion involved the construction of a fourth
cryogenic processing train at our existing gas plant in Opal,
Wyoming. This fourth train boosted Opal’s overall
processing capacity from 750 MMcf/d to more than
1.1 billion cubic feet per day, with the ability to recover
in excess of 50 Mbbls/d of NGL products. Originally, this
fourth train was owned by Willbros Mt. West, Inc. and revenues
from the processing were shared with Willbros. We purchased this
plant from Willbros in January 2006, and now operate only for
our interests.

From the Opal plant, gas can be delivered to markets throughout
the West Coast and in the Rockies via connections to three
interstate pipelines — Colorado Interstate Pipeline,
Kern River Pipeline and our own Northwest Pipeline.

Gathering and processing — deepwater projects

The deepwater Gulf continues to be an attractive growth area for
our Midstream business. Investments like our Alpine pipeline and
Devils Tower production facilities continue to increase our
fee-based business and our scale in the Gulf.

Our floating production system and associated pipelines, Devils
Tower, became operational on May 5, 2004. Initially built
to serve Dominion Exploration & Production’s
Devils Tower field, the floating production system is located in
Mississippi Canyon Block 773, approximately 150 miles
south-southwest of Mobile, Alabama. During the fourth quarter of
2005, the platform’s service expanded to include the Triton
and Goldfinger fields in addition to the Devils Tower field.
Located in 5,610 feet of water, it is the world’s
deepest dry tree spar. The platform, which is operated by
Dominion on our behalf, is capable of producing 60 MMcf/d
of natural gas and 128 Mbbls/d of oil.

The Devils Tower project includes gas and oil pipelines. The

102-mile

Canyon Chief
gas pipeline consists of

18-inch

diameter pipe.
The

117-mile

Mountaineer oil pipeline is a combination of 18- and

20-inch

diameter



pipe. The gas is delivered into Transco’s pipeline, and
processed at our Mobile Bay plant to recover the NGLs. The oil
is transported to ChevronTexaco’s Empire Terminal in
Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana.

Our

18-inch

oil
pipeline, Alpine, which became operational on December 14,
2003 is averaging approximately 17.6 Mbbls/d for the fourth
quarter of 2005. The pipeline extends 96 miles from Garden
Banks Block 668 in the central Gulf of Mexico to our
shallow-water platform at Galveston Area Block A244. From this
platform, the oil is delivered onshore through ExxonMobil’s
Hoover Offshore Oil Pipeline System under a joint tariff
agreement. This production is coming from the Gunnison field,
which is located in 3,150 feet of water and operated by
Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Kerr-McGee Corporation.

Since 1997, we have invested almost $1 billion in new
midstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico. These facilities provide
both onshore and offshore services through pipelines, platforms
and processing plants. The new facilities could also attract
incremental gas volumes to Transco’s pipeline system in the
southeastern United States.

Customers and operations

Our domestic gas gathering and processing customers are
generally natural gas producers who have proved and/or producing
natural gas fields in the areas surrounding our infrastructure.
During 2005, these operations gathered and processed gas for
approximately 200 gas gathering customers and 130 processing
customers. Our top three gathering and processing customers
accounted for about 34 percent of our domestic gathering
revenue and processing gross margin. Our gathering and
processing agreements are generally long-term agreements.

In addition to our gathering and processing operations, we also
market NGLs and petrochemical products to a wide range of users
in the energy and petrochemical industries. We provide these
products to third parties from the production at our domestic
facilities. The majority of domestic sales are based on supply
contracts of less than one year in duration. The production from
our Canadian facilities is marketed in Canada and in the United
States.

Our Venezuelan assets were constructed and are currently
operated for the exclusive benefit of PDVSA. The significant
contracts have a remaining term between 12 and 16 years and
our revenues are based on a combination of fixed capital
payments, throughput volumes, and, in the case of one of the gas
compression facilities, a minimum throughput guarantee. The
political situation in Venezuela has enjoyed relative calm since
the defeat of the 2004 referendum to remove President Hugo
Chavez from office. However, President Chavez has confirmed his
public criticism of U.S. policy and has implemented
unilateral changes to existing energy related contracts,
indicating that a level of political risk still remains.

Other

At December 31, 2003, we owned approximately
32 percent of Longhorn, which owns a refined petroleum
products pipeline from Houston, Texas to El Paso, Texas.
During February 2004, we participated in a recapitalization plan
completed by Longhorn, following which our subsidiaries,
Longhorn Enterprises of Texas, Inc. (LETI) and Williams
Petroleum Services, LLC (WPS), together own, directly or
indirectly, approximately 94.7 percent of the Class B
Interests in Longhorn Pipeline Investors, LLC (Pipeline
Investors) and approximately 21.3 percent of the Common
Interests therein. Pipeline Investors indirectly owns Longhorn.
The recapitalization provided the funds necessary to complete
final construction and

start-up

of the
pipeline. As part of the recapitalization, LETI sold a portion
of its limited partner interests in Longhorn for
$11.4 million, and LETI and WPS sold a portion of the debt
owed to them individually by Longhorn for approximately
$58 million. In addition, in exchange for the Common
Interests described above, LETI contributed the remaining
balance of its limited partnership interests, and WPS
contributed all of its general partnership interests in the
general partner of Longhorn. LETI and WPS also exchanged the
remaining debt owed by Longhorn for the Class B Interests
described above. The Class B Interests are preferred
interests but subordinate to the new investors’ preferred
interests, and the Common Interests are subordinate to both.

During the first quarter of 2005, Longhorn became fully
operational as deliveries commenced through both the Odessa and
El Paso terminals. However, the pipeline’s throughput
fell significantly short of management expectations. The primary
driver behind this volume shortfall was the narrowing of the
refined product pricing differentials between the Gulf Coast and
El Paso markets. During the second quarter of 2005,
Longhorn management indicated the shortfall was likely to
continue and that the original business model was no longer
feasible. A financial advisor was engaged to develop alternative
economic options for the pipeline. The three primary
alternatives being considered were:

•

sale of the pipeline;

•

conversion to alternative service;

•

expansion to the Phoenix/ Tucson markets.

As a result of the other-than-temporary decline in fair value
identified in the second quarter, we impaired the Common
Interests by $16.2 million and the Class B shares by
$32.7 million. After these adjustments, our book value of
our investment in Longhorn (as of June 30, 2005) totaled
$51.6 million, comprised of $25.0 million of Common
Interests and $26.6 million of Class B shares.

During the third quarter of 2005, we provided $10 million
of a $50 million fully collateralized bridge loan to fund
operations of Longhorn until an economically feasible
operational alternative was developed. In the fourth quarter of
2005, management of Longhorn concluded that its preferred
strategy was the sale of the Longhorn assets. Accordingly, they
directed the financial advisor to solicit offers from several
entities. The financial advisor is currently working to
facilitate a transaction by the end of the second quarter 2006.
After reviewing the terms and conditions of the bids, our
management has determined a full impairment of our investment in
the Class B and Common Interests is appropriate. This
decision resulted in a December 31, 2005 write-down of the
remaining $38.1 million in book value which had been
further reduced by additional equity losses during the third and
fourth quarters. However, we expect to receive full payment on
the $10 million bridge loan from the proceeds of the sale.

Additional business segment information

Our ongoing business segments are accounted for as continuing
operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes to
financial statements included in Part II.

Operations related to certain assets in “Discontinued
Operations” sold in 2003 and 2004 have been reclassified
from their traditional business segment to “Discontinued
Operations” in the accompanying financial statements and
notes to financial statements included in Part II.

Our corporate parent company performs certain management, legal,
financial, tax, consultative, administrative and other services
for our subsidiaries.



Our principal sources of cash are from external financings,
dividends and advances from our subsidiaries, investments,
payments by subsidiaries for services rendered, interest
payments from subsidiaries on cash advances and net proceeds
from asset sales. The amount of dividends available to us from
subsidiaries largely depends upon each subsidiary’s
earnings and operating capital requirements. The terms of many
of our subsidiaries’ borrowing arrangements limit the
transfer of funds to our corporate parent.

We believe that we have adequate sources and availability of raw
materials and commodities for existing and anticipated business
needs. In support of our energy commodity activities, primarily
conducted through Power, we are required by counterparties to
provide various forms of credit support such as margin, adequate
assurance amounts and pre-payments for gas supplies. Our
pipeline systems are all regulated in various ways resulting in
the financial return on the investments made in the systems
being limited to standards permitted by the regulatory agencies.
Each of the pipeline systems has ongoing capital requirements
for efficiency and mandatory improvements, with expansion
opportunities also necessitating periodic capital outlays.

REGULATORY MATTERS

Power.

Our Power business is subject to a variety of laws
and regulations at the local, state and federal levels,
including regulation by the FERC and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. In addition, electricity and natural gas
markets in California and elsewhere continue to be subject to
numerous and wide-ranging federal and state regulatory
proceedings and investigations. We are also subject to various
federal and state actions and investigations regarding, among
other things, market structure, behavior of market participants,
market prices, and reporting to trade publications. We may be
liable for refunds and other damages and penalties as a result
of ongoing actions and investigations. The outcome of these
matters could affect our creditworthiness and ability to perform
contractual obligations as well as other market
participants’ creditworthiness and ability to perform
contractual obligations to us.

Gas Pipelines.

Gas Pipeline’s interstate
transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by
the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and under
the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as such, its rates and
charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate
commerce, its accounting, and the extension, enlargement or
abandonment of its jurisdictional facilities, among other
things, are subject to regulation. Each gas pipeline company
holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by
the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines,
facilities and properties for which certificates are required
under the NGA. Each gas pipeline company is also subject to the
Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which
regulates safety requirements in the design, construction,
operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission
facilities. FERC Order 2004 “Standards of Conduct for
Transmission Providers” governs how our interstate
pipelines communicate and do business with their energy
affiliates, Power and Exploration & Production. One of
the cornerstones of Order 2004 is that interstate pipelines will
not operate their pipeline systems to preferentially benefit
their energy affiliates.

Each of our interstate natural gas pipeline companies
establishes its rates primarily through the FERC’s
ratemaking process. Key determinants in the ratemaking process
are:

•

costs of providing service, including depreciation expense;

•

allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the
    capital structure and related income taxes;

•

volume throughput assumptions.

The allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate
design and the allocation of costs between the demand and
commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these
proceedings, certain revenues previously collected may be
subject to refund.

Exploration & Production.

Our
Exploration & Production business is subject to various
federal, state and local laws and regulations on taxation, the
development, production and marketing of oil and gas, and
environmental and safety matters. Many laws and regulations
require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells, rates
of production, water discharge, prevention of waste and other
matters. Such laws and regulations



have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling,
installing, operating and abandoning our oil and gas wells and
other facilities. In addition, these laws and regulations, and
any others that are passed by the jurisdictions where we have
production, could limit the total number of wells drilled or the
allowable production from successful wells, which could limit
our reserves.

Midstream.

For our Midstream segment, onshore gathering
is subject to regulation by states in which we operate and
offshore gathering is subject to the Outer Continental Shelf
Lands Act (OCSLA). Of the states where Midstream operates,
currently only Kansas and Texas actively regulate gathering
activities. Those states regulate gathering primarily through
complaint mechanisms under which the state commission may
resolve disputes involving an individual gathering arrangement.
Although gathering facilities located offshore are not subject
to the NGA, some controversy exists as to how the FERC should
determine whether offshore facilities function as gathering.
These issues are currently before the FERC. Most gathering
facilities offshore are subject to the OCSLA, which provides in
part that outer continental shelf pipelines “must provide
open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and non-owner
shippers.”

Our remaining Midstream Canadian assets are regulated by the
Alberta Energy & Utilities Board (AEUB) and
Alberta Environment. The regulatory system for the Alberta oil
and gas industry incorporates a large measure of
self-regulation, providing that licensed operators are held
responsible for ensuring that their operations are conducted in
accordance with all provincial regulatory requirements. For
situations in which non-compliance with the applicable
regulations is at issue, the AEUB and Alberta Environment have
implemented an enforcement process with escalating consequences.

See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further details on our regulatory matters.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Our generation facilities, natural gas pipelines, and
exploration and production operations are subject to federal
environmental laws and regulations as well as the state and
tribal laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in
which we operate. We could incur liability to governments or
third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other
pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as liability
for clean up costs. Materials could be released into the
environment in several ways including, but not limited to:

Because the requirements imposed by environmental laws and
regulations are frequently changed, we cannot assure you that
laws and regulations enacted in the future, including changes to
existing laws and regulations, will not adversely affect our
business. In addition, because we acquire properties that have
been operated in the past by others, we may be liable for
environmental damage caused by such former operators.

We believe compliance with environmental laws and regulations
will not have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position. However, environmental laws
and regulations could affect our business in various ways from
time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance
expenditures, imposing limitations on generation facility
availability, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek
relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of
certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance
expenses (which we believe would be granted).

For a discussion of specific environmental issues, see
“Environmental” under Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
“Environmental Matters” in Note 15 of our Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.



COMPETITION

Power.

In our Power segment, we compete directly with
large independent energy marketers, marketing affiliates of
regulated pipelines and utilities and natural gas producers. We
also compete with both brokerage houses and other energy-based
companies offering similar services. Since 2002, we have fewer
competitors due to the exit of independent energy marketers from
the marketplace and the exit of utilities from financial
merchant activities. We anticipate more competition in the
future from brokerage houses, which are increasing their trading
activity.

Gas Pipeline.

Our Gas Pipeline segment faces increased
competition as a result of various actions taken by the FERC and
several states in which we operate to strengthen market forces
in the natural gas pipeline industry. In a number of key
markets, interstate pipelines are now facing competitive
pressures from other major pipeline systems, enabling local
distribution companies and end users to choose a supplier or
switch suppliers based on the short-term price of gas and the
cost of transportation. We expect competition for natural gas
transportation to continue to intensify in future years due to
increased customer access to other pipelines, rates,
competitiveness among pipelines, customers’ desire to have
more than one transporter, shorter contract terms, regulatory
developments, and development of LNG facilities particularly in
our market areas. Future utilization of pipeline capacity will
depend on competition from other pipelines and LNG facilities,
use of alternative fuels, the general level of natural gas
demand, and weather conditions.

Suppliers of natural gas are able to compete for any gas markets
capable of being served by pipelines using nondiscriminatory
transportation services provided by the pipeline companies. As
the regulated environment has matured, many pipeline companies
have faced reduced levels of subscribed capacity as contractual
terms expire and customers opt to reduce firm capacity under
contract in favor of alternative sources of transmission and
related services. This situation, known in the industry as
“capacity turnback,” is forcing the pipeline companies
to evaluate the consequences of major demand reductions in
traditional long-term contracts. It could also result in
significant shifts in system utilization, and possible
realignment of cost structure for remaining customers since all
interstate natural gas pipeline companies continue to be
authorized to charge maximum rates approved by the FERC on a
cost of service basis. Gas Pipeline does not anticipate any
significant financial impact from “capacity turnback.”
We anticipate that we will be able to remarket most future
capacity subject to future capacity turnback, although
competition may cause some of the remarketed capacity to be sold
at lower rates or for shorter terms.

Exploration & Production.

Our
Exploration & Production segment competes with other
oil and gas concerns, including major and independent oil and
gas companies in the development, production and marketing of
natural gas. We compete in areas such as acquisition of oil and
gas properties and obtaining necessary equipment, supplies and
services. We also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled
employees.

Midstream.

In our Midstream segment, we face regional
competition with varying competitive factors in each basin. Our
gathering and processing business competes with other midstream
companies, interstate and intrastate pipelines, master limited
partnerships (MLP), producers and independent gatherers and
processors. We primarily compete with five to ten companies
across all basins in which we provide services. Numerous factors
impact any given customer’s choice of a gathering or
processing services provider, including rate, location, term,
timeliness of well connections, pressure obligations and the
willingness of the provider to process for either a fee or for
liquids taken in-kind. We also compete in recruiting and
retaining skilled employees. In 2005 we formed Williams Partners
to help compete against other master limited partnerships for
midstream projects. By virtue of the master limited partnership
structure, Williams Partners provides us with an alternative and
low-cost source of capital. We expect the alternative, low-cost
capital will allow it to compete with other MLPs when pursuing
acquisition opportunities of gathering and processing assets.

EMPLOYEES

At February 28, 2006, we had approximately
3,913 full-time employees including 856 at the corporate
level, 116 at Power, 1,574 at Gas Pipeline, 502 at
Exploration & Production, and 865 at Midstream. None of
our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective
bargaining agreements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS/ RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT

FOR PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain matters contained in this report, excluding historical
information, include forward-looking statements —
statements that discuss our expected future results based on
current and pending business operations. We make these
forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor
protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts,
included in this report which address activities, events or
developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or
may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of
words such as “anticipates,” “believes,”
“could,” “may,” “should,”
“continues,” “estimates,”
“expects,” “forecasts,” “might,”
“planned,” “potential,”
“projects,” “scheduled” or similar
expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among
others, statements regarding:

Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions,
uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or
results to be materially different from those stated or implied
in this document.

Some of these risks are described in the “Risk
Factors” section of this report and one should keep in mind
these risk factors when considering forward-looking statements.
Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly
rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any
obligation to update the above list or to announce publicly the
result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements
to reflect future events or developments. Further, the
information about our intentions contained or incorporated into
this report represents our intention as of the date of this
report and is based on, among other things, the existing
regulatory environment, industry conditions, market conditions
and prices, the economy in general and our assumptions as of
such date. We may change our intentions, at any time and without
notice, based upon any changes in such factors, in our
assumptions, or otherwise.



RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in
addition to the other information in this Report. Each of these
factors could adversely affect our business, operating results,
and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of
an investment in our securities.

Risks Inherent to our Industry and Business

The long-term financial condition of our natural gas
transmission and midstream businesses is dependent on the
continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply
basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our
traditional markets, and market demand for natural gas.

The development of additional natural gas reserves requires
significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and
development drilling and the installation of production,
gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that
permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline
systems. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or
the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely
affect the development of additional reserves and production,
gathering, storage and pipeline transmission and import and
export of natural gas supplies. Additional natural gas reserves
might not be developed in commercial quantities and in
sufficient amounts to fill the capacities of our gathering,
transmission and processing pipeline facilities. Additionally,
in some cases, new LNG import facilities built near our markets
could result in less demand for our gathering and transmission
facilities.

Estimating reserves and future net revenues involves
uncertainties and negative revisions to reserve estimates, and
oil and gas price declines may lead to impairment of oil and gas
assets.

Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating
underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured
in an exact manner. Reserves that are “proved
reserves” are those estimated quantities of crude oil,
natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered
as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects.

The process relies on interpretations of available geological,
geophysical, engineering and production data. There are numerous
uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved
reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing
of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the
control of the producer. The reserve data included in this
Report represent estimates. In addition, the estimates of future
net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of
such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future
production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be
correct over time.

Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic
conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Lower
oil and gas prices may have the impact of shortening the
economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic
to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which
reduces proved property reserve estimates.

If negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved
reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing
the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the
affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in
losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense. The revisions may also be sufficient to trigger
impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a
further non-cash charge to earnings. The revisions could also
possibly affect the evaluation of Exploration &
Production’s goodwill for impairment purposes.



Historic performance of our exploration and production
business is no guarantee of future performance.

Our success rate for drilling projects in 2005 should not be
considered a predictor of future performance.

Performance of our exploration and production business is
affected in part by factors beyond our control, such as:

Our drilling, production, gathering, processing and
transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result
in accidents and other operating risks and costs.

Our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards
typically associated with the development and exploration for,
and the production and transportation of oil and gas. These
operating risks include, but are not limited to:

In addition, there are inherent in our gas gathering, processing
and transporting properties a variety of hazards and operating
risks, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems that
could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these
risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to
property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations
and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary
industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not
all, of these risks and losses. The location of pipelines near
populated areas, including residential areas, commercial
business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level
of damages resulting from these risks. Certain segments of our
pipelines run through such areas. In spite of our precautions,
an event could cause considerable harm to people or property,
and could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position and results of operations, particularly if the event is
not fully covered by insurance. Accidents or other operating
risks could further result in loss of service available to our
customers. Such circumstances could adversely impact our ability
to meet contractual obligations and retain customers.

Costs of environmental liabilities and complying with
existing and future environmental regulations could exceed our
current expectations.

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and
municipal laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations
impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and
obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use,
storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous
substances and wastes, in connection with spills, releases and
emissions of various substances into the environment, and in
connection with the operation, maintenance, abandonment and
reclamation of our facilities.



Compliance with environmental laws will require significant
expenditures, including for clean up costs and damages arising
out of contaminated properties. The possible failure to comply
with environmental laws and regulations that might result in the
imposition of fines and penalties. We are generally responsible
for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition
of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed,
regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are
known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and
divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide
indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could
expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by
insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take
to bring certain facilities into compliance could be
prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down,
divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might
cause us to incur losses. Although we do not expect that the
costs of complying with current environmental laws will have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations, no assurance can be given that the costs of
complying with environmental laws in the future will not have
such an effect.

We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible
expenditures related to environmental conditions based on
current laws and regulations and current interpretations of
those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or
regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our
assumptions may change. Our regulatory rate structure and our
contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to
recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new
environmental regulations. Also, we might not be able to obtain
or maintain from time to time all required environmental
regulatory approvals for certain development projects. If there
is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory
approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the
operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject
to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse
consequences to our operations.

Our operating results for certain segments of our business
might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.

Revenues from certain segments of our business, including gas
transmission and the sale of electric power, can have seasonal
characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for power
peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also
peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks
during the winter. In addition, demand for gas and other fuels
peaks during the winter. As a result, our overall operating
results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a
seasonal basis. Demand for gas and other fuels could vary
significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and
location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of
our power sale agreements and gas transmission arrangements
relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns.
Additionally, changes in the price of natural gas could benefit
one of our business units, but disadvantage another. For
example, our Exploration & Production business may
benefit from higher natural gas prices, and Power, which uses
gas as a fuel source, may not.

Risks Related to the Current Geopolitical Situation

Our investments and projects located outside of the United
States expose us to risks related to laws of other countries,
taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates,
political conditions and policies of foreign governments. These
risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our
international projects.

We currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material
energy-related investments and projects outside the United
States. The economic and political conditions in certain
countries where we have interests or in which we might explore
development, acquisition or investment opportunities present
risks of delays in construction and interruption of business, as
well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization,
renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing
contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater
than in the United States. The uncertainty of the legal
environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or
acquire projects or make investments could make it more
difficult to obtain non-recourse project or other financing on
suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain
customers to honor their obligations with respect to such
projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce
our rights under agreements relating to such projects or
investments.



Operations in foreign countries also can present currency
exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation
risk. In certain conditions under which we develop or acquire
projects, or make investments, economic and monetary conditions
and other factors could affect our ability to convert our
earnings denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, risk
from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our
foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of
currency but receive revenue in another. In such cases, an
adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet
expenses, including debt service obligations. Foreign currency
risk can also arise when the revenues received by our foreign
subsidiaries are not in U.S. dollars. In such cases, a
strengthening of the U.S. dollar could reduce the amount of
cash and income we receive from these foreign subsidiaries. We
have put contracts in place to mitigate our most significant
foreign currency exchange risks. We have some exposures that are
not hedged which could result in losses or volatility in our
earnings.

Risks Related to Strategy and Financing

Our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may
adversely affect our ability to operate our business.

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict
or limit among other things, our ability to create liens, sell
assets, make certain distributions, repurchase equity and incur
additional debt. In addition, our debt agreements contain, and
those we enter into in the future may contain, financial
covenants and other limitations with which we will need to
comply. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be
affected by many events beyond our control, and we cannot assure
you that our future operating results will be sufficient to
comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under
any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default.

Our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements
and other related transactional documents could result in events
of default. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the
lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a
particular facility to be immediately due and payable and
terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. An
event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement
could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another
debt agreement. Such a default or acceleration could have a
wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a
default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If an event
of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default,
and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate
the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we
may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding
under such debt agreements.

Developments affecting the wholesale power and energy
trading industry sector have reduced market activity and
liquidity and might continue to adversely affect our results of
operations.

In 2004, we announced our decision to maintain our wholesale
power and energy trading business and trading portfolio.
Therefore, the legacy issues arising out of the 2000-2001 energy
crisis in California, the resulting collapse in energy merchant
credit and volatility in natural gas prices, the Enron
Corporation bankruptcy filing, and investigations by
governmental authorities into energy trading activities and
increased litigation related to such inquiries, could continue
to affect us in the future. These market factors have led to
industry-wide downturns that have resulted in some companies
being forced to exit the energy trading markets leading to a
reduction in the number of trading partners and market liquidity.

Our lack of investment grade credit ratings increases our
costs of doing business in many ways and increases our risks
from market disruptions and further credit downgrades.

Because we do not have an investment grade credit rating, our
transactions in each of our businesses require greater credit
assurances, both to be given from, and received by, us to
satisfy credit support requirements. In addition, we are more
vulnerable to the impact of market disruptions or a further
downgrade



of our credit rating that might further increase our cost of
borrowing or further impair our ability to access one or any of
the capital markets. Such disruptions could include:

Despite our restructuring efforts, we may not attain
investment grade ratings.

Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when
assigning credit ratings. Given the significant changes in
capital markets and the energy industry over the last few years,
credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for
attaining investment grade ratings and make changes to those
criteria from time to time. Our goal is to attain investment
grade ratios. However, there is no guarantee that the credit
rating agencies will assign us investment grade ratings even if
we meet or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios.

Electricity, natural gas liquids and gas prices are
volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our
financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to
maintain existing businesses.

Our revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of
growth and the value of our power and gas businesses depend
primarily upon the prices we receive for natural gas,
electricity and other commodities. Prices also affect the amount
of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability
to borrow money or raise additional capital.

Historically, the markets for these commodities have been
volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide
fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor
changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities,
market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our
control, including:

We might not be able to successfully manage the risks
associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale
energy markets.

Our portfolios consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell
commodities, including contracts for electricity, natural gas,
natural gas liquids and other commodities that are settled by
the delivery of the



commodity or cash throughout the United States. If the values of
these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not
anticipate or cannot manage, we could realize material losses
from our marketing. In the past, certain marketing and trading
companies have experienced severe financial problems due to
price volatility in the energy commodity markets. In certain
instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to
deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under
contract. In such event, we might incur additional losses to the
extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from,
counterparties. In addition, in our businesses, we often extend
credit to our counterparties. Despite performing credit analysis
prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we
might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. If the
counterparty to such a financing transaction fails to perform
and any collateral that secures our counterparty’s
obligation is inadequate, we will lose money.

If we are unable to perform under our energy agreements, we
could be required to pay damages. These damages generally would
be based on the difference between the market price to acquire
replacement energy or energy services and the relevant contract
price. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy
markets, such damages could be significant.

Risks Related to Regulations that Affect our Industry

Our gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are
subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that
could have an adverse impact on the profitability of these
operations.

Our interstate gas sales, transmission, and storage operations
conducted through our Gas Pipelines business are subject to the
FERC’s rules and regulations in accordance with the Natural
Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The
FERC’s regulatory authority extends to:

Regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in
many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues,
decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and
otherwise altering the profitability of our business.

The FERC has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces
in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased
competition throughout the industry. In a number of key markets,
interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from
other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution
companies and end users to choose a transmission provider based
on considerations other than location.

Our revenues might decrease if we are unable to gain
adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission and
distribution assets due to the FERC and regional regulation of
wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas.

We depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and
operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the
electricity and natural gas we buy and sell in the wholesale
market. If transmission is disrupted, if capacity is inadequate,
or if credit requirements or rates of such utilities or energy
companies are increased, our ability to sell and deliver
products might be hindered. The FERC has issued power
transmission regulations that require wholesale electric
transmission services to be offered on an open-access,
non-discriminatory basis. Although these regulations are
designed to encourage competition in wholesale market
transactions for electricity, we believe that some companies may
have failed to provide fair and equal access to



their transmission systems or have not provided sufficient
transmission capacity to enable other companies to transmit
electric power. We cannot predict whether and to what extent the
industry will comply with these initiatives, or whether the
regulations will fully accomplish the FERC’s objectives.

In addition, the independent system operators who oversee the
transmission systems in regional power markets, such as
California, have in the past been authorized to impose, and
might continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms
to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price
limitations and other mechanisms might adversely impact the
profitability of our wholesale power marketing and trading.
Given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term
price history in many of these markets and the imposition of
price limitations by regulators, independent system operators or
other marker operators, we can offer no assurance that we will
be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets.

The different regional power markets in which we compete
or will compete in the future have changing regulatory
structures, which could affect our growth and performance in
these regions.

Our results are likely to be affected by differences in the
market and transmission regulatory structures in various
regional power markets. Problems or delays that might arise in
the formation and operation of new regional transmission
organizations (RTOs) might restrict our ability to sell power
produced by our generating capacity to certain markets if there
is insufficient transmission capacity otherwise available. The
rules governing the various regional power markets might also
change from time to time which could affect our costs or
revenues. Because it remains unclear which companies will be
participating in the various regional power markets, or how RTOs
will develop and evolve or what regions they will cover, we are
unable to assess fully the impact that these power markets might
have on our business.

Our businesses are subject to complex government
regulations. The operation of our businesses might be adversely
affected by changes in these regulations or in their
interpretation or implementation.

Existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws
and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us or
our facilities, and future changes in laws and regulations might
have a detrimental effect on our business. Over the past few
years, certain restructured energy markets have experienced
supply problems and price volatility. In some of these markets,
including California, proposals have been made by governmental
agencies and other interested parties to re-regulate areas of
these markets which have previously been deregulated. Various
forms of market controls and limitations including price caps
and bid caps have already been implemented and new controls and
market restructuring proposals are in various stages of
development, consideration and implementation. We cannot assure
you that changes in market structure and regulation will not
adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that other
proposals to re-regulate will not be made or that legislative or
other attention to the electric power restructuring process will
not cause the deregulation process to be delayed or reversed.

The outcome of pending rate cases to set the rates we can
charge customers on certain of our pipelines might result in
rates that do not provide an adequate return on the capital we
have invested in those pipelines.

We anticipate that in the next twelve months we will file rate
cases with the FERC to request changes to the rates we charge on
Northwest Pipeline and Transco. The outcome of those rate cases
is uncertain. There is a risk that rates set by the FERC will be
lower than is necessary to provide us with an adequate return on
the capital we have invested in these assets. There is also the
risk that higher rates will cause our customers to look for
alternative ways to transport their natural gas.

Legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations
relating to the energy industry and capital markets have
adversely affected our business and many continue to do
so.

Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the
capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being
either proposed or implemented. Such scrutiny has also resulted
in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in
which we are a named defendant.



Such inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing
and continue to adversely affect our business as a whole. We
might see these adverse effects continue as a result of the
uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings, or
additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state
regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we
cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether
these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings
against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other
regulatory action, including legislation, which might be
materially adverse to the operation of our business and our
revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other
ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters against us
arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including
environmental matters, disputes over gas measurement, royalty
payments, shareholder class action suits, regulatory appeals and
similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us.
The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in
the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or
at all by insurance.

Risks Related to Accounting Standards

Potential changes in accounting standards might cause us
to revise our financial results and disclosure in the future,
which might change the way analysts measure our business or
financial performance.

Accounting irregularities discovered in the past few years in
various industries have forced regulators and legislators to
take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial
disclosures, companies’ relationships with their
independent auditors and retirement plan practices. Because it
is still unclear what laws or regulations will ultimately
develop, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future
changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with
respect to public companies or the energy industry or in our
operations specifically.

In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) or the SEC could enact new accounting standards that
might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses,
assets and liabilities.

Risks Related to Market Volatility and Risk Management

Our reported results are subject to volatility around our use of
derivatives that hedge the economic risk of our commodity
exposures. Some derivatives do not qualify as hedges under
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (SFAS 133) and so
changes in fair value are recorded to income. During the period
from 2002 to 2004 when our Power business was for sale, most
changes in the fair value of derivatives used in our Power
business were recorded to income as net forward unrealized

mark-to

-market gains.
In future periods, the cash associated with those hedges could
be realized but the value will have already been recorded in
income.

Our risk measurement and hedging activities might not
prevent losses.

We manage our commodity price risk for our unregulated
businesses as a whole. Although we have risk measurement systems
in place that use various methodologies to quantify risk, these
systems might not always be followed or might not always work as
planned. Further, such risk measurement systems do not in
themselves manage risk, and adverse changes in energy commodity
market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity
prices, the liquidity of markets, and changes in interest rates
might still adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and our
balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks
have been identified.

In an effort to manage our financial exposure related to
commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into
contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and
operations, including our long-term tolling agreements. In these
hedging activities, we have used fixed-price, forward, physical
purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and
option contracts traded in the

over-the

-counter
markets or on exchanges, as well as long-term structured
transactions when feasible. Nevertheless, no single hedging
arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given
contract. For example, a forward contract that would be
effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not
hedge the tolling contract’s counterparty credit or
performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue
to exist. While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk
within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be



able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future
cash flows could be impacted by counterparty default.

The impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the
average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the
level of our hedging strategies. These hedging arrangements may
limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas
were to rise substantially over the price established by the
hedge. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the
risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including
instances in which:

•

production is less than expected;

•

a change in the difference between published price indexes
    established by pipelines in which our hedged production is
    delivered and the reference price established in the hedging
    arrangements is such that we are required to make payments to
    our counterparties;

•

the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor
    their financial commitments.

Risks Related to Employees, Outsourcing of Non-Core Support
Activities

Institutional knowledge residing with current employees or
our former employees now employed by our outsourcing service
providers might not be adequately preserved.

In certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge
resides with employees who have many years of service. As these
employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace
them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience.
Other qualified individuals could leave us or refuse our offers
of employment if our recruiting and retention efforts are
unsuccessful. Our efforts at knowledge transfer could be
inadequate.

Due to the large number of our former employees who were
migrated to an outsourcing provider in 2004, access to
significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and
expertise could become unavailable to us, particularly if
knowledge transfer initiatives are delayed or ineffective.

Failure of the outsourcing relationships might negatively
impact our ability to conduct our business.

Some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing
relationships. Although we have taken steps to build a
cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our
outsourcing providers, a failure of all or part of these
relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and
interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct
our business.

Our ability to receive services from outsourcing provider
locations outside of the United States might be impacted by
cultural differences, political instability, or unanticipated
regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the United
States.

Certain accounting, information technology application
development, human resources, and helpdesk services that are
currently provided by our outsourcing provider were relocated to
service centers outside of the United States during 2005. The
economic and political conditions in certain countries from
which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us
present similar risks of business operations located outside of
the United States previously discussed, including risks of
interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization,
renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing
contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater
than in the United States.

Risks Related to Weather, other Natural Phenomena and
Business Disruption

Our assets and operations can be affected by weather and
other natural phenomena.

Our assets and operations, especially those located offshore,
can be adversely affected by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes
and other natural phenomena and weather conditions including
extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize
the historic rates of return associated with these assets and
operations.



Our current information technology infrastructure is aging
and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our
business.

Limited capital spending for information technology
infrastructure during 2001-2003 resulted in an aging server
environment that may not be adequate for our current business
needs. While efforts are ongoing to update the environment, the
current age and condition of equipment could result in loss of
internal and external communications, loss of data, inability to
access data when needed, excessive software downtime (including
downtime for critical software applications), and other
disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on our
business.

Properties

We own property in 34 states plus the District of Columbia
in the United States and in Argentina, Canada and Venezuela.

Power’s primary assets are its term contracts, related
systems and technological support. In addition, affiliates of
Power own the Hazelton and Milagro generating facilities
described above. In our Gas Pipeline and Midstream segments, we
generally own our facilities, although a substantial portion of
our pipeline and gathering facilities is constructed and
maintained pursuant to

rights-of

-way,
easements, permits, licenses or consents on and across
properties owned by others. In our Exploration &
Production segment, the majority of our ownership interest in
exploration and production properties is held as working
interests in oil and gas leaseholds.

Some of our subsidiaries’ borrowing arrangements limit the
transfer of funds to us. These terms have not impeded, nor are
they expected to impede, our ability to pay dividends. However,
until January 20, 2005, the credit agreements underlying
our two unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling
$500 million prohibited us from paying quarterly cash
dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.05 per share. On
January 20, 2005, these facilities were terminated and
replaced with two new facilities. As part of the transaction,
the dividend restriction, along with most of the other
restrictive covenants, was removed from the new credit
agreements.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

General

We are primarily a natural gas company, engaged in finding,
producing, gathering, processing, and transporting natural gas.
We also manage a wholesale power business. Our operations are
located principally in the United States and are organized into
the following reporting segments: Power, Gas Pipeline,
Exploration & Production, and Midstream Gas &
Liquids (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of reporting segments).

Unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion of critical
accounting policies and estimates, discussion and analysis of
results of operations and financial condition and liquidity
relates to our current continuing operations and should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in Part II Item 8 of this
document.

Overview of 2005

We entered 2005 having completed the key components of our 2003
restructuring plan and in a position to shift our focus to
growth. Our 2005 plan included the following objectives:

Our 2005

income from continuing operations

increased to
$317.4 million, as compared to $93.2 million in 2004.
Our 2005 results reflect the benefit of increased natural gas
production and higher net realized average prices, along with
reduced levels of interest expense. Results for 2004 included
$282.1 million in costs associated with the early
retirement of debt, while results for 2005 were reduced by
accruals associated with agreements to resolve gas reporting
issues and impairments of certain investments. Our

net cash
provided by operating activities

was $1.45 billion in
2005, comparable with the 2004 level of $1.49 billion. In
addition to achieving these results, the following represent
significant actions or events that occurred during the year:

•

In 2005, we further improved our credit ratios from those
    achieved in 2004. We retired $200 million of debt that
    matured January 15, 2005. On February 16, the holders
    of the remaining 10.9 million equity forward contracts
    associated with the FELINE PACS units exercised contracts to
    purchase one share of our common stock for $25 a share,
    resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $273 million.
    The remaining notes associated with the FELINE PACS units
    totaling approximately $73 million are due
    February 16, 2007.

•

During 2005, Exploration & Production increased its
    average daily domestic production levels, its net realized
    average prices, and its developmental drilling activities. In
    March 2005, Exploration & Production entered into a
    lease for ten new drilling rigs to support the accelerated pace
    of natural gas



Outlook for 2006

Our plan for 2006 is focused on continued disciplined growth.
Objectives of this plan include:

•

Continue to improve both
    EVA

®

and segment profit.

•

Invest in our natural gas businesses in a way that improves
    EVA

®

,
    meets customer needs, and enhances our competitive position.



As a result of the strategy to grow our natural gas businesses,
we estimate capital expenditures will increase to approximately
$2.0 to $2.2 billion in 2006, compared to $1.3 billion
in 2005. We expect to fund capital and investment expenditures,
debt payments, dividends and working-capital requirements
through cash generated from operations, which is currently
estimated to be between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion
in 2006, as well as proceeds from debt issuances, sales of units
of Williams Partners L.P., and cash and cash equivalents on hand
as needed.

Potential risks and/or obstacles that could prevent us from
achieving these objectives include:

We continue to address these risks through utilization of
commodity hedging strategies, focused efforts to resolve
regulatory issues and litigation claims, disciplined investment
strategies, and maintaining our desired level of at least
$1 billion in liquidity from cash and revolving credit
facilities.

New Accounting Standards and Emerging Issues

Accounting standards that have been issued and are not yet
effective, or that have not yet been issued, may have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements in the future.
These include:

See

Recent Accounting Standards

in Note 1 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
these and other recently issued accounting standards.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our financial statements reflect the selection and application
of accounting policies that require management to make
significant estimates that require subjective and complex
judgment. The selection of these policies has been discussed
with our Audit Committee. We believe that the following are the
more critical judgment areas in the application of our
accounting policies that currently affect our financial
condition and results of operations.



Revenue Recognition — Derivatives

We hold a substantial portfolio of energy trading and
non-trading contracts for a variety of purposes. We review these
contracts to determine whether they are non-derivatives or
derivatives. If they are derivatives, we further assess whether
the contracts qualify for either cash flow hedge accounting or
the normal purchases and normal sales exception. The
determination of whether a derivative contract qualifies as a
cash flow hedge includes an analysis of historical market price
information to assess whether the derivatives are expected to be
highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable
to the hedged risk. For derivatives that are designated as cash
flow hedges, changes in their fair value are not reflected in
earnings until the associated hedged item affects earnings. For
those that have not been designated as hedges or do not qualify
for hedge accounting, the net change in their fair value is
recognized in income currently (marked to market). Derivatives
for which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has
been elected are accounted for on an accrual basis. The fair
value for derivative contracts is determined based on the nature
of the transaction and the market in which transactions are
executed. We also incorporate assumptions and judgments about
counterparty performance and credit considerations in our
determination of their fair value.

Contracts are executed in the following environments:

•

Exchange-traded or

over-the

-counter
    markets with quoted prices;

•

Exchange-traded or

over-the

-counter
    markets with quoted market prices but limited price
    transparency, requiring increased judgment to determine fair
    value;

•

Markets without quoted market prices.

The number of transactions executed without quoted market prices
is limited. We estimate the fair value of these contracts by
using readily available price quotes in similar markets and
other market analyses. The fair value of all derivative
contracts is continually subject to change as the underlying
commodity market changes and our assumptions and judgments
change.

Additional discussion of the accounting for energy contracts at
fair value is included in Energy Trading Activities within
Item 7,

Item 7A — Qualitative and
Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk

, and Note 1
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Oil- and Gas-Producing Activities

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil-
and gas-producing activities. Estimated natural gas and oil
reserves and forward market prices for oil and gas are a
significant part of our financial calculations and certain
estimated reserves are used as collateral to secure financing.
Following are examples of how these estimates affect financial
results:

•

An increase (decrease) in estimated proved oil and gas reserves
    can reduce (increase) our

unit-of-

production
    depreciation, depletion and amortization rates.

•

Changes in oil and gas reserves and forward market prices both
    impact projected future cash flows from our oil and gas
    properties. This, in turn, can impact our periodic impairment
    analyses, including that for goodwill.

The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very
complex, requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all
available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic
data. After being estimated internally, 99 percent of our
reserve estimates are either audited or prepared by independent
experts. The data may change substantially over time as a result
of numerous factors, including additional development activity,
evolving production history, and a continual reassessment of the
viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a
result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates could
occur from time to time. A revision of our reserve estimates
within reasonably likely parameters is not expected to result in
an impairment of our oil and gas properties or goodwill.
However, reserve estimate revisions would impact our
depreciation and depletion expense prospectively. For example, a
change of approximately 10 percent in oil and gas reserves
for each basin would change our annual

depreciation,
depletion and amortization

expense



between approximately $20 million and $25 million. The
actual impact would depend on the specific basins impacted and
whether the change resulted from proved developed, proved
undeveloped or a combination of these reserve categories.

Forward market prices, which are utilized in our impairment
analyses, include estimates of prices for periods that extend
beyond those with quoted market prices. This forward market
price information is consistent with that generally used in
evaluating our drilling decisions and acquisition plans. These
market prices for future periods impact the production economics
underlying oil and gas reserve estimates. The prices of natural
gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period, thus
impacting our estimates. An unfavorable change in the forward
price curve within reasonably likely parameters is not expected
to result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties or
goodwill.

Contingent Liabilities

We record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies,
including environmental matters, when we assess that a loss is
probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in
the period in which new or different facts or information become
known or circumstances change that affect the previous
assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss.
Liabilities for contingent losses are based upon our assumptions
and estimates and upon advice of legal counsel, engineers, or
other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the
matter. As new developments occur or more information becomes
available, our assumptions and estimates of these liabilities
may change. Changes in our assumptions and estimates or outcomes
different from our current assumptions and estimates could
materially affect future results of operations for any
particular quarterly or annual period. See Note 15 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets And Tax
    Contingencies

We have deferred tax assets resulting from certain investments
and businesses that have a tax basis in excess of the book basis
and from tax carry-forwards generated in the current and prior
years. We must evaluate whether we will ultimately realize these
tax benefits and establish a valuation allowance for those that
may not be realizable. This evaluation considers tax planning
strategies, including assumptions about the availability and
character of future taxable income. At December 31, 2005,
we have $940 million of deferred tax assets for which a
$37 million valuation allowance has been established. When
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we considered
forecasts of future company performance, the estimated impact of
potential asset dispositions and our ability and intent to
execute tax planning strategies to utilize tax carryovers. Based
on our projections, we believe that it is probable that we can
utilize our year-end 2005 federal tax net operating loss
carryovers and capital loss carryovers prior to their
expiration. We are not expecting to be able to utilize
$24 million, or approximately $8 million of tax
benefit, of the charitable contribution carryovers expiring in
2006. The remaining $20 million of charitable contributions
are expected to be utilized prior to their expiration. We also
do not expect to be able to utilize $29 million of foreign
deferred tax assets related to carryovers. See Note 5 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the tax carryovers. The ultimate amount of
deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from
those recorded, as influenced by potential changes in
jurisdictional income tax laws and the circumstances surrounding
the actual realization of related tax assets.

We regularly face challenges from domestic and foreign tax
authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges
include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions
and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In
evaluating the liability associated with our various filing
positions, we record a liability for probable tax contingencies.
The ultimate disposition of these contingencies could have a
material impact on net cash flows. To the extent we were to
prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or
were required to pay amounts in excess of our accrued liability,
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may
be materially impacted.



Impairment of Long-Lived Assets And Investments

We evaluate our long-lived assets and investments for impairment
when we believe events or changes in circumstances indicate that
we may not be able to recover the carrying value of certain
long-lived assets or the decline in carrying value of an
investment is other-than-temporary. In addition to those
long-lived assets and investments for which impairment charges
were recorded (see Notes 2, 3, and 4 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements), certain others were reviewed
for which no impairment was required. Our computations utilized
judgments and assumptions in the following areas:

Canadian Olefins

We continue to assess our Canadian olefins assets for impairment
based on previously identified indicators. Our investment in
these assets is currently not estimated to be recoverable
without modifications to or a renegotiation of key terms in an
off-gas processing agreement. We have performed recoverability
tests that considered varying outcomes relating to successful
renegotiation of the processing agreements. Our computations
used judgments and assumptions in the following areas:

After applying probability weightings to the various scenarios,
we determined that the assets did not require impairment at
December 31, 2005 and 2004. A critical assumption in our
impairment analysis was the valuation of future contract terms
in the related processing agreement. Unsuccessful renegotiation
of the contract or a decrease of approximately 20 percent
or more in our low case contract valuation estimate would likely
result in an impairment.

Aux Sable

We own a 14.6 percent equity interest in Aux Sable Liquid
Products LP (Aux Sable), which owns and operates a natural gas
liquids extraction and fractionation facility. During 2003, we
performed an impairment review of our investment in Aux Sable as
operating results and cash flow projections suggested that a
decline in the fair value of this investment below our carrying
value could exist. We estimated the fair value of our investment
based on a projection of discounted cash flows of Aux Sable.
Based upon our analysis, we recorded a $14.1 million
impairment of this investment.

During 2005, we decided to pursue a potential sale of this
investment. We have recorded an impairment of $23 million
based on our estimate of sales proceeds from this investment.

Pension and Postretirement Obligations

We have employee benefit plans that include pension and other
postretirement benefits. Pension and other postretirement
benefit plan expense and obligations are calculated by a
third-party actuary and are impacted by various estimates and
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include the
expected long-



term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, expected
rate of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, and
employee demographics, including retirement age and mortality.
These assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made
as needed. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and the
benefit obligations are shown in Note 7 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below presents the
estimated increase (decrease) in pension and other
postretirement benefit expense and obligations resulting from a
one-percentage-point change in the specified assumption.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are
determined by combining a review of historical returns realized
within the portfolio, the investment strategy included in the
plans’ Investment Policy Statement, and the capital market
projections provided by our independent investment consultant
for the asset classifications in which the portfolio is invested
as well as the target weightings of each asset classification.
These rates are impacted by changes in general market
conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term
market swings do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to
our target asset allocation would also impact these rates. Our
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used for our
pension plans has been 8.5 percent since 2002. Over the
past ten years, our actual average return on plan assets for our
pension plans has been approximately 8.6 percent.

The discount rates are used to discount future benefit
obligations to today’s dollars. Decreases in these rates
increase the obligation and related expense. The discount rates
for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were
determined separately based on an approach specific to our plans
and their respective expected benefit cash flows as described in
Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our
discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general
economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on
long-term, high-quality corporate bonds.

The expected rate of compensation increase represents average
long-term salary increases. An increase in this rate causes
pension obligation and expense to increase.

The assumed health care cost trend rates are based on our actual
historical cost rates that are adjusted for expected changes in
the health care industry.



Results of Operations

Consolidated Overview

The following table and discussion is a summary of our
consolidated results of operations for the three years ended
December 31, 2005. The results of operations by segment are
discussed in further detail following this consolidated overview
discussion.

(1)

+ = Favorable Change; - = Unfavorable Change; NM = A percentage
    calculation is not meaningful due to change in signs, a
    zero-value denominator or a percentage change greater than 200.

2005 vs. 2004

The $122.3 million increase in revenues is due primarily to
increased revenues at Exploration & Production due to
higher natural gas prices and production volumes sold and gas
management income, and at Midstream due primarily to increased
natural gas liquids (NGL) prices and crude marketing
revenue.



Partially offsetting these increases is decreased revenue at
Power due primarily to the absence of crude and refined products
activity and reduced net forward unrealized

mark-to

-market gains.

The $119.3 million increase in

costs and operating
expenses

is due primarily to increased crude marketing costs
and increased NGL costs at Midstream in addition to
increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and gas
management expense at Exploration & Production.
Partially offsetting these increases are decreased costs at
Power primarily due to the absence of crude and refined products
activity.

The $30.1 million decrease in

selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expenses

is primarily due to a
$17.1 million reduction in expenses at Gas Pipeline to
record the cumulative impact of a correction to pension expense
attributable to the periods 2003 and 2004 and a $9.7 reduction
of bad debt expense at Power resulting from the sale of certain
receivables to a third party. Partially offsetting these items
is increased staffing costs at Exploration & Production
in support of increased operational drilling activity.

Other (income) expense — net,

within

operating income,

in 2005 includes the following significant
    items:

•

An $82.2 million accrual for litigation contingencies at
    Power, associated primarily with agreements reached to
    substantially resolve exposure related to certain natural gas
    price and volume reporting issues;

•

Gains totaling $29.6 million on the sale of two natural gas
    properties at Exploration & Production;

•

A gain of $9 million on a sale of property in the Other
    segment.

Other (income) expense — net,

within

operating income,

in 2004 includes:

The $35.1 million increase in

general corporate expenses

is due primarily to $13.8 million of expense related to
the settlement of certain insurance coverage issues and a
$16 million increase in outside legal costs associated
primarily with securities class action matters.

The $163.2 million decrease in

interest
accrued — net

is due primarily to lower average
borrowing levels in 2005 as compared to 2004.

The $24.3 million decrease in

investing income

is
due primarily to a $76.4 increase in impairment charges on our
investment in Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn), a
$13.9 million increase in Longhorn equity losses, and a
$23 million impairment of our Aux Sable equity investment.
Partially offsetting these decreases are the following increases:

•

A $30.4 million increase in domestic and international
    equity earnings, excluding Longhorn and Aux Sable;

•

The absence in 2005 of a $20.8 million impairment of an
    international cost-based investment;



•

The absence in 2005 of a $16.9 million impairment of our
    Discovery Producer Services LLC (Discovery) equity investment;

•

An $8.6 million gain on the sale of our remaining interests
    in the MAPL and Seminole assets;

•

The absence in 2005 of a $6.5 million Longhorn
    recapitalization fee.

Early debt retirement costs

include premiums, fees and
expenses related to the retirement of debt.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes

changed unfavorably
by $82.6 million due primarily to increased pre-tax income
in 2005 as compared to 2004. The effective income tax rate for
2005 is higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to
state income taxes, nondeductible expenses, the effect of taxes
on foreign operations and the inability to utilize charitable
contribution carryovers. The 2005 effective income tax rate has
been reduced by a benefit adjustment to reduce the overall
deferred income tax liabilities and favorable settlements on
federal and state income tax matters. The effective income tax
rate for 2004 is higher than the federal statutory rate due
primarily to state income taxes, a charge associated with
charitable contribution carryovers and the effect of taxes on
foreign operations. A 2004 accrual for income tax contingencies
was offset by favorable settlements of certain federal and state
income tax matters.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations

in 2004 is
comprised of gains on the sales of the Canadian straddle plants
and the Alaska refinery of $189.8 million and
$3.6 million, respectively, as well as $22 million in
income from our Canadian straddles discontinued operation.
Partially offsetting these are $153 million of charges to
increase our accrued liability associated with certain Quality
Bank litigation matters.

Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles

in
2005 is due to the implementation of FIN 47, (see Note 9 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

2004 vs. 2003

The $4.2 billion decrease in

revenues

is due
primarily to an approximately $3.9 billion decrease in
revenues at Power resulting from lower realized revenues from
power and crude and refined products. Partially offsetting the
decrease was an increase in Midstream’s revenues of
$97.8 million reflecting higher volumes and improved NGL
margins.

The $4.3 billion decrease in

costs and operating
expenses

is due primarily to lower costs and operating
expenses at Power. This decrease is due primarily to lower
purchase volumes of power and crude and refined products.

The $65.8 million decrease in

SG&A expense

is
due primarily to a $36 million decrease in compensation
expense at Power due to reduced staffing levels, combined with
the absence of $13.6 million of expense related to the
accelerated recognition of deferred compensation during 2003. In
addition, Midstream’s

SG&A expense

declined
$18 million largely due to asset sales and lower legal
expense.

Other (income) expense — net,

within

operating income

in 2004 is included in the

2005 vs.

discussion.

in 2003 includes:



The $32.8 million increase in

general corporate expenses

is due primarily to efforts to evaluate and implement
certain cost reduction strategies, and initial costs associated
with outsourcing of certain services, increased legal costs due
primarily to shareholder litigation and ERISA matters, and
increased third-party costs associated with certain mandated
compliance activities.

The $420.3 million decrease in

interest
accrued — net

includes:

The $25.2 million decrease in

investing income

includes $57.1 million lower interest income due
primarily to higher net interest income at Power in 2003 as a
result of certain FERC proceedings. The decrease was partially
offset by $29.6 million higher equity earnings. Impairments
and results from investment sales were substantially comparable
in both periods.

Early debt retirement costs

include payments in excess of
the carrying value of the debt, dealer fees and the write-off of
deferred debt issuance costs and discount/premium on the debt.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes

increased by
$136.6 million due primarily to pre-tax income in 2004
compared to a pre-tax loss in 2003. The effective income tax
rate for 2004 is greater than the federal statutory rate due
primarily to the effect of state income taxes, a charge
associated with charitable contribution carryovers and the
effect of taxes on foreign operations. A 2004 accrual for tax
contingencies was offset by favorable settlements of certain
federal and state income tax matters. The effective income tax
rate for the 2003 benefit for income taxes is lower than the
federal statutory rate due primarily to nondeductible impairment
of goodwill, nondeductible expenses, an accrual for tax
contingencies and the effect of state income taxes, somewhat
offset by the tax benefit of capital losses.



The primary components of

income (loss) from discontinued
operations

in 2004 are included in the

2005 vs. 2004

discussion.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations

in
2003 is composed of the following pre-tax items:

The

cumulative effect of change in accounting principles

reduced

net income (loss)

for 2003 by
$761.3 million due to a $762.5 million charge related
to the adoption of
EITF

02-3

(see
Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements),
slightly offset by $1.2 million related to the adoption of
SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” (see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

In June 2003, we redeemed all of our outstanding
9.875 percent cumulative-convertible preferred shares.
Thus, no preferred dividends were paid in 2004.



Results of Operations — Segments

We are currently organized into the following segments: Power,
Gas Pipeline, Exploration & Production, Midstream and
Other. Other primarily consists of corporate operations and
certain continuing operations formerly included in the
previously reported International and Petroleum Services
segments. Our management currently evaluates performance based
on segment profit (loss) from operations (see Note 18 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect all segment
changes. The following discussions relate to the results of
operations of our segments.

Power

Overview of 2005

Power’s comparative operating results in 2005 were
significantly influenced by the effect of cash flow hedge
accounting and increased average natural gas and power prices.
In fourth quarter 2004, Power designated a portion of its power
and natural gas derivative contracts as cash flow hedges. As
such, we deferred recognition of certain unrealized

mark-to

-market gains in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

in 2005. Similar
unrealized gains were recorded to earnings in 2004 and 2003
prior to the application of hedge accounting. Power’s 2005
earnings do reflect unrealized

mark-to

-market gains
from (1) net increases in the fair value of forward
derivative contracts held for trading purposes or which did not
qualify for hedge accounting, and (2) hedge ineffectiveness.

Power’s 2005 results also reflect the combined impact of
increased natural gas and power prices on its nonderivative
tolling contracts. Although the average price of power
increased, there was a greater increase in the average purchase
price of natural gas, which is used to produce power. Hurricane
Katrina and mild weather in California affected the prices of
natural gas and power. The narrowing of the margin between power
and natural gas prices and an outage at an electric generation
facility resulted in an accrual gross margin loss (realized
costs in excess of realized revenue) on certain tolling
contracts. The chart below illustrates the impact of the
unrealized

mark-to

-market gain and
accrual gross margin loss on Power’s total gross margin
(revenue less cost of sales). The below chart does not reflect,
however, cash flows that Power realized in 2005 from hedges for
which mark-to-market gains or losses had been previously
recognized. In 2005, Power had positive cash flows from
operations. In addition to these declining margins, significant
accruals for litigation contingencies, which were substantially
resolved in 2006, and an impairment of an equity investment
further adversely impacted Power’s 2005 results.



In 2005, Power continued to focus on its objectives of
minimizing financial risk, maximizing cash flow, meeting
contractual commitments, executing new contracts to hedge its
portfolio and providing functions that support our natural gas
businesses.

Key factors that may influence Power’s financial condition
and operating performance include:

Outlook for 2006

For 2006, Power intends to service its customers’ needs
while increasing the certainty of cash flows from its long-term
tolling contracts by executing new long-term electricity and
capacity sales contracts. In 2005 and early 2006, Power entered
into electricity and capacity forward contracts with fixed sales
prices for over 6,000 megawatts of capacity in total across
various periods through 2010. Most of these contracts are
treated on an accrual basis as either operating subleases or
normal sales contracts under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(SFAS 133).

As Power continues to apply hedge accounting in 2006, its future
earnings may be less volatile. However, not all of Power’s
derivative contracts qualify for hedge accounting. Because the
derivative contracts qualifying for hedge accounting were
previously marked to market through earnings prior to their
being designated as cash flow hedges, the amounts recognized in
future earnings under hedge accounting will not necessarily
align with the expected cash flows to be realized from the
settlement of those derivatives. For example, to the extent that
future earnings reflect losses from underlying transactions,
such as natural gas purchases and power sales associated with
tolling transactions, that have been hedged by the derivatives,
the corresponding offsetting gains from the hedges have already
been recognized in prior periods under

mark-to

-market
accounting. However, cash flows from Power’s portfolio
continue to reflect the net amount from both the hedged
transactions and the hedges.

Even with the adoption of hedge accounting, Power’s
earnings will continue to reflect

mark-to

-market
volatility from unrealized gains and losses resulting from:

•

Market movements of commodity-based derivatives that are held
    for trading purposes;

•

Market movements of commodity-based derivatives that represent
    economic hedges but which do not qualify for hedge accounting;

•

Ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges, primarily caused by
    locational differences between the hedging derivative and the
    hedged item or changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties.

The fair value of Power’s tolling, full requirements,
transportation, storage and transmission contracts is not
reflected in the balance sheet since these contracts are not
derivatives. Some of these contracts have a significant negative
estimated fair value and could also result in future operating
profits or losses as a result of the volatile nature of energy
commodity markets. The inability of counterparties to perform
under contractual obligations due to their own credit
constraints could also affect future results.



Year-Over-Year Results

2005 vs. 2004

The $164.8 million decrease in revenues includes a
$32.9 million decrease in

realized revenues

and a
$131.9 million decrease in

net forward unrealized

mark-to

-market
gains

.

Realized revenues represent (1) revenue from the sale of
commodities or completion of energy-related services, and
(2) gains and losses from the net financial settlement of
derivative contracts. The $32.9 million decrease in

realized revenues

is primarily due to the absence in 2005
of $471 million in crude and refined products realized
revenues, partially offset by a $444 million increase in
power and natural gas realized revenues.

The absence of crude and refined products revenues is due to the
sale of the refined products business in 2004. Power and natural
gas realized revenues increased primarily due to a
33 percent increase in average natural gas sales prices and
a 17 percent increase in average power sales prices.
Hurricane Katrina, among other factors, contributed to the
increase in prices. A 29 percent decrease in power sales
volumes partially offsets the increase in prices. Power sales
volumes decreased because Power did not replace certain
long-term physical contracts that expired or were terminated and
because of mild weather in California, which resulted in lower
demand.

Net forward unrealized

mark-to

-market gains
and losses represent changes in the fair values of certain
derivative contracts with a future settlement or delivery date
that have not been designated as cash flow hedges and the impact
of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges. The
$131.9 million decrease in

net forward unrealized

mark-to

-market
gains

is primarily due to a $165 million decrease
associated with power and gas derivative contracts, partially
offset by the absence in 2005 of a $38 million unrealized
loss on the interest rate portfolio in 2004.

The decrease in power and gas unrealized

mark-to

-market gains
primarily results from the impact of cash flow hedge accounting,
which was prospectively applied to certain of Power’s
derivative contracts beginning October 1, 2004. Net
unrealized gains of $711 million related to the effective
portion of the hedges are reported in

accumulated other
comprehensive loss

in 2005 compared to $15 million in
2004. If Power had not applied cash flow hedge accounting in
2005, we would have reported the $711 million in

revenues

instead of in

accumulated other comprehensive
loss

. Also in 2005, Power recognized losses of
$6.8 million representing a correction of unrealized losses
associated with a prior year. Our management concluded that the
effects of this correction are not material to prior periods,
2005 results, or our trend of earnings. Partially offsetting
these decreases is the effect of a greater increase in forward
power prices on a greater volume of power purchase contracts in
2005 compared to 2004, resulting in increased unrealized

mark-to

-market gains on
net power derivatives that are not accounted for as cash flow
hedges.



The absence in 2005 of the unrealized loss on the interest rate
portfolio is due to the termination and liquidation of all
remaining interest-rate derivatives in fourth quarter 2004. A
decrease in forward interest rates caused unrealized losses in
the interest rate portfolio in 2004.

The $77 million increase in Power’s

cost of
sales

is primarily due to an increase in power and natural
gas costs of $563 million, partially offset by a decrease
in crude and refined products costs of $486 million. Power
and natural gas costs increased primarily due to a
32 percent increase in average power purchase prices and a
44 percent increase in average natural gas purchase prices,
partially offset by a 29 percent decrease in power purchase
volumes. Hurricane Katrina, among other factors, contributed to
the increase in prices. Costs in 2005 include approximately
$8 million in purchases due to an outage at an electric
generating facility that Power has access to via a fuel
conversion service agreement. A 2004 reduction to certain
contingent loss accruals of $10.4 million associated with
power marketing activities in California during 2000 and 2001
also contributes to the increase in costs. Costs in 2004 include
$486 million of crude and refined products costs, which are
absent in 2005 due to the sale of the refined products business
in 2004. Costs in 2004 also reflect a $13 million payment
made to terminate a nonderivative power sales contract.

SG&A expenses

decreased primarily due to decreased
employee incentive compensation and decreased costs for outside
services. A $9.7 million reduction of allowance for bad
debts resulting from the sale of certain receivables to a third
party also contributed to the decrease in

SG&A
expenses

.

SG&A expenses

in 2004 include a
$6.3 million reduction of allowance for bad debts resulting
from a 2004 settlement with certain California utilities.

Other (income) expense — net

in 2005 includes:

•

An $82.2 million accrual for estimated litigation
    contingencies, primarily associated with agreements reached to
    substantially resolve exposure related to natural gas price and
    volume reporting issues (see Note 15 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements);

•

A $4.6 million accrual for a regulatory settlement;

•

A $23 million impairment of an equity investment (see
    Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other (income) expense — net

in 2004 includes
$6.1 million in fees related to the sale of certain
receivables to a third party.

Although increased gas prices favorably impacted the fair value
of Power’s derivative natural gas hedges, the
$333.4 million change from a

segment profit

to a

segment loss

is primarily due to the impact of cash flow
hedge accounting. Additionally, plant outages and depressed
margin spreads between the cost of gas and sales price of
electricity contributed to lower

segment profit

. Accruals
in 2005 for litigation contingencies and an impairment of an
equity investment also contribute to the change in

segment
profit (loss)

. Partially offsetting the decrease in

segment profit

is the absence in 2005 of unrealized and
realized losses from the interest rate portfolio, which was
liquidated in the fourth quarter of 2004.

2004 vs. 2003

The $3.9 billion decrease in

revenues

includes an
approximately $4 billion decrease in

realized
revenues

partially offset by a $41.9 million increase
in

net forward unrealized mark-to-market gains

.

The approximately $4 billion decrease in

realized
revenues

is primarily due to an approximately
$3.1 billion decrease in power and natural gas realized
revenues and an $862 million decrease in crude and refined
products realized revenues.

Power and natural gas

realized revenues

decreased
primarily due to a 47 percent decrease in power sales
volumes, partially offset by a 5 percent increase in power
sales prices. Sales volumes decreased because Power did not
replace certain long-term physical contracts that expired or
were terminated in 2003, primarily due to a lack of market
liquidity and past efforts to reduce our commitment to the Power
business. In addition, results for 2003 include a realized gain
of $126.8 million based on the terms of an agreement to
terminate a derivative



contract. In addition, during 2003, revenues include the
correction of the accounting treatment previously applied to
certain third party derivative contracts during 2002 and 2001,
resulting in the recognition of approximately $117 million
in revenues attributable to prior periods. Refer to Note 1
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information. Additionally, power and natural gas revenues in
2003 include a $37 million reduction for increased power
rate refunds owed to the state of California as the result of
FERC rulings. Crude and refined products revenues decreased
primarily due to the sale of the crude gathering business in
2003, the sale of the refined products business in 2004 and the
past efforts to exit this line of business.

In 2004, Power had

net forward unrealized mark-to-market
gains

of $304 million, an increase of
$41.9 million from 2003. The increase in unrealized gains
is due to a $75 million increase associated with power and
gas contracts, partially offset by an $11 million decrease
in crude and refined products and a $22 million decrease in
the interest rate portfolio. The increase in power and gas
primarily results from a greater increase associated with
near-term natural gas forward prices in 2004 than in 2003. Also
contributing to the increase was the absence in 2004 of
unrealized losses of approximately $70 million recognized
in first quarter 2003 on contracts for which we elected the
normal purchases and sales exception in second quarter 2003.
Another factor contributing to the increase was the impact of
cash flow hedge accounting, which was prospectively applied to
certain of Power’s forecasted transactions beginning
October 1, 2004. A net loss of $15 million related to
the effective portion of the hedges was reported in

accumulated other comprehensive income

in 2004. The
decrease in crude and refined products primarily results from
the sale of the crude gathering business in 2003, the sale of
the refined products business in 2004 and the past efforts to
exit this line of business. These activities led to a
significantly smaller derivative position in 2004 than in 2003
which resulted in lower unrealized mark-to-market gains. The
decrease in the interest rate portfolio is due primarily to a
decrease in forward interest rates in first quarter 2004
compared to a slight increase in first quarter 2003.

The $3.9 billion decrease in Power’s

cost of
sales

is primarily due to a decrease in power and natural
gas costs of approximately $3 billion and a decrease in
crude and refined products costs of $904.5 million. Power
and natural gas costs decreased primarily due to a
48 percent decrease in power purchase volumes, partially
offset by a 2 percent increase in power prices. A
$10.4 million reduction to certain contingent loss accruals
in 2004 and a $13.8 million loss for other contingencies in
2003, both associated with power marketing activities in
California during 2000 and 2001, contributed to the decrease in
costs discussed above. Costs in 2004 also reflect a
$13 million payment made to terminate a nonderivative power
sales contract, which partially offsets the decrease in power
and natural gas costs. Crude and refined products costs
decreased primarily due to the sale of the crude gathering
business in 2003, the sale of the refined products business in
2004, and other past efforts to exit this line of business.

The $40.8 million decrease in

SG&A expenses

is
largely due to a $36 million decline in compensation
expense, primarily as a result of staff reductions in prior
years combined with the accelerated recognition of
$13.6 million in 2003 of certain deferred compensation
arrangements. In addition, a $6.3 million reduction of
allowance for bad debts resulting from the 2004 settlement with
certain California utilities and the absence of a
$6.5 million bad debt charge associated with a termination
settlement in 2003 also contributed to the decrease.

Other (income) expense — net

in 2004 includes
$6.1 million in fees related to the sale of certain
receivables to a third party.

Other (income)
expense — net

in 2003 includes a $188 million
gain from the sale of an energy-trading contract and a
$13.8 million gain from the sale of certain investments.
These income items are partially offset by the effect of the
following 2003 items:



•

A $14.1 million impairment associated with the Aux Sable
    partnership investment (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements).

The $58.4 million decrease in

segment profit

is
primarily due to lower sales volumes and the absence in 2004 of
income from certain terminated contracts and prior period
adjustments and the effect of the other income changes noted
above, partially offset by lower

SG&A expense

.

Gas Pipeline

Overview

We operate, through our Northwest Pipeline and Transco
subsidiaries, approximately 14,600 miles of pipeline from
the Gulf Coast to the northeast United States and from northern
New Mexico to the Pacific northwest with a total annual
throughput of approximately 2,600 trillion BTUs.
Additionally, we hold a 50 percent interest in Gulfstream
Natural Gas System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream). This asset, which
extends from the Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in
Florida, has current transportation capacity of 1.1 billion
cubic feet per day.

Our strategy to create value for our shareholders focuses on
maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing
high quality, low cost transportation of natural gas to large
and growing markets.

Gas Pipeline’s interstate transmission and storage
activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such,
our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in
interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment
of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things,
are subject to regulation. The rates are established through the
FERC’s ratemaking process. Changes in commodity prices and
volumes transported have little impact on revenues because the
majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity
reservation charges in transportation rates.

Significant events of 2005

Grays Harbor

Effective January 2005, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC
(Duke) terminated its firm transportation agreement related to
Northwest Pipeline’s Grays Harbor lateral. In January 2005,
Duke paid Northwest Pipeline $94 million for the remaining
book value of the asset and the related income taxes. We and
Duke have not agreed on the amount of the income taxes due
Northwest Pipeline as a result of the contract termination. We
have deferred the $6 million difference between the
proceeds and net book value of the lateral pending resolution of
the disputed early termination obligation.

On June 16, 2005, we filed a Petition for a Declaratory
Order with the FERC requesting that it rule on our
interpretation of our tariff to aid in resolving the dispute
with Duke. On July 15, 2005, Duke filed a motion to
intervene and provided comments supporting its position
concerning the issues in dispute.

Gulfstream pipeline expansions

Gulfstream completed a major extension and began service under
new contracts in 2005.

•

In February, the

110-mile

Phase II
    natural gas pipeline expansion was placed into service. This
    facilitated the increase of long-term transportation volumes by
    350 million cubic feet per day.

•

In June, Gulfstream began incremental natural gas transportation
    service of 400,000 dekatherms per day (Dth/d) for two major
    Florida utilities.

•

In August, Gulfstream established transportation service of up
    to 48,000 Dth/d for an additional Florida utility.

With these additional agreements, Gulfstream’s long-term
transportation commitment is now approximately 69 percent
of total pipeline capacity.



Litigation related to recovery of fuel costs

In August 2005, pursuant to a settlement agreement, we resolved
all outstanding issues pertaining to a regulatory filing
involving recovery of certain fuel costs in prior periods. As a
result of this ruling, we recognized income of
$14.2 million from the reversal of a related liability.

Central New Jersey Expansion Project

In November 2005, Transco began operation of the

3.5-mile

Central New
Jersey Expansion Project on our Transco natural gas pipeline
system. The expansion provides an additional 105,000 Dth/d
of firm natural gas transportation service in Transco’s
northeastern market area. The capacity has been fully subscribed
by a single shipper for a twenty-year term.

Significant 2005 adjustments

Operating results for the year include:

•

Adjustments of $17.7 million were recorded, reflected as a
    $12.1 million reduction of

costs and operating
    expenses

and a $5.6 million reduction of

SG&A
    expenses

. These cost reductions were corrections of the
    carrying value of certain liabilities that were recorded in
    prior periods. Based on a review by management, these
    liabilities were no longer required.

•

Pension expense was reduced by $17.1 million in the second
    quarter of 2005 to reflect the cumulative impact of a correction
    of an error attributable to 2003 and 2004. The error was
    associated with our third-party actuarial computation of annual
    net periodic pension expense and resulted from the
    identification of errors in certain Transco participant data
    involving annuity contract information utilized for 2003 and
    2004.

•

Adjustments of $37.3 million reflected as increases in

costs and operating expenses

related to
    $32.1 million of prior period accounting and valuation
    corrections for certain inventory items and an accrual of
    $5.2 million for contingent refund obligations.

Our management concluded that the effects of these adjustments
are not material to our consolidated results for 2005 or prior
periods, or to our trend of earnings.

Outlook for 2006

Filing of rate cases

During 2006, we will be focused on successfully filing rate
cases for both Transco and Northwest Pipeline subsidiaries which
are expected to result in new transportation and storage rates
beginning in 2007.

FERC Order “Accounting for Pipeline Assessment
    Cost”

FERC Order

“Accounting for Pipeline Assessment
Costs,”

effective January 1, 2006, requires
FERC-regulated companies to expense certain pipeline
integrity-related assessment costs that we have historically
capitalized. As a result of this Order we anticipate expensing
approximately $27 million to $35 million of costs
expected to be incurred in 2006 that would have been capitalized
prior to the Order becoming effective.

Northwest pipeline capacity replacement project

In September 2005, we received FERC approval to construct and
operate approximately 80 miles of

36-inch

pipeline loop,
which will replace most of the capacity previously served by
268 miles of

26-inch

pipeline in the
Washington state area. The estimated cost of the project is
$333 million, with an anticipated in-service date of
November 1, 2006.



Colorado gas pipeline expansion

In January 2006, we filed an application with the FERC to
construct a

38-mile

expansion that would provide additional natural gas
transportation capacity in northwest Colorado. The planned
expansion would increase capacity by 450,000 Dth/d through
the

30-inch

diameter
line and is estimated to cost $55 million. We are currently
in discussions with shippers to determine the level of
commitment and anticipate beginning service on the expansion in
January 2007.

Leidy to Long Island expansion project

In December 2005, we filed an application with the FERC to
construct an expansion of our existing facilities in the
northeast United States. This project will provide
100,000 Dth/d of incremental firm capacity, which has been
fully subscribed for a twenty-year primary term. The estimated
capital cost of the project is approximately $121 million
with three-quarters of that spending expected to occur in 2007.
The expansion is expected to be in service by November 1,
2007.

During 2004, our management and decision-making control of
certain regulated gas gathering assets were transferred from our
Midstream segment to our Gas Pipeline segment. Consequently, the
results of operations were similarly reclassified and all prior
periods reflect this reclassification.

2005 vs. 2004

The $50.5 million, or 4 percent, increase in Gas
Pipeline

revenues

is due primarily to $86 million
higher revenues associated with exchange imbalance cash-out
settlements (offset in

costs and operating expenses

).
Partially offsetting this increase is $24 million lower
transportation revenues due primarily to the termination of the
Grays Harbor contract, and $11 million lower revenues
associated with reimbursable costs, which are passed through to
customers (offset in

costs and operating expenses

and

SG&A expenses

).

Costs and operating expenses

increased $109 million,
or 16 percent, due primarily to:

Partially offsetting these increases are decreases due to:

•

Income of $14.2 million associated with the resolution of
    the litigation related to recovery of gas costs;

•

The cost reduction of $12.1 million due to adjusting the
    carrying value of certain liabilities as noted previously;

•

Lower reimbursable costs of $5 million (offset in

revenues

).



SG&A expenses

decreased approximately
$38 million, or 31 percent, due to the
$17.1 million reduction in pension costs to correct a prior
period error, $6 million lower reimbursable costs (offset
in

revenues

), and the reversal of $5.6 million of
prior period accruals.

Comparative

segment profit

is unchanged from 2004. The
following are significant components of 2005 segment profit:

2004 vs. 2003

The $6 million decrease in Gas Pipeline

revenues

is
due to the following:

Partially offsetting these revenue reductions is
$46 million higher transportation revenue primarily from
expansion projects.

Costs and operating

expenses decreased $2 million
due primarily to:

These decreases were partially offset by:



SG&A expenses

decreased $11 million, or
9 percent, due primarily to $6 million lower
reimbursable costs (offset in revenues) and $4 million
lower rent resulting from the terms of a new office lease at
Transco.

Other (income) expense — net

in 2004 includes
an approximate $9 million charge for the write-off of
previously capitalized costs incurred on an idled segment of
Northwest Pipeline’s system that we determined will not be
returned to service.

Other (income) expense — net

in 2003 includes a $25.6 million charge at Northwest
Pipeline to write off capitalized software development costs for
a service delivery system following a decision not to implement
and $7.2 million of income at Transco resulting from a
reduction of

accrued liabilities

for claims associated
with certain producers as a result of settlements and court
rulings (see Royalty indemnifications in Note 15 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements).

The $30.3 million, or 5 percent, increase in

segment profit

, which includes equity earnings and income
(loss) from investments is due to the following:

These increases to

segment profit

were partially offset
by:

•

A $9 million charge for the write-off of previously
    capitalized costs discussed above;

Exploration & Production

Overview of 2005

In 2005, we continued our strategy to rapidly expand the
development of our significant drilling inventory located in our
key growth basins. Our major accomplishments for the year
include:

•

Increased average daily domestic production levels by
    approximately 18 percent from last year, surpassing our
    goal of 15 percent. The domestic average daily production
    for the year ending December 31, 2005, was approximately
    612 million cubic feet of gas equivalent (MMcfe) compared
    to 519 MMcfe in 2004.



Domestic Production Growth

2005 domestic production grew 18 percent or 93 MMcfe per
day over 2004

•

Benefited from higher market prices which, in turn, increased
    our net realized average prices received for production volumes
    sold. Net realized average prices include market prices, net of
    hedge positions, less gathering and transportation expenses. We
    realized net domestic average prices of $4.69 per thousand
    cubic feet of gas equivalent (Mcfe) compared with $3.17 per
    Mcfe in 2004, an increase of approximately 48 percent.

•

Increased our development drilling program throughout 2005,
    surpassing annual drilling activities prior to 2005. We drilled
    1,629 gross wells in 2005 compared to 1,395 in 2004.
    Capital expenditures for domestic drilling, development, and
    acquisition activity in 2005 were approximately
    $768 million compared to approximately $436 million in
    2004.

The benefits of higher production volumes and higher net
realized average prices were partially offset by increased
operating costs and increased derivative hedge losses in 2005.
The increase in operating costs was primarily the result of
escalated overall production and maintenance activities among
oil and gas producers, which increased competition for drilling
rigs and services in our basins. The increase in hedge losses
was primarily due to higher market prices associated with our
NYMEX collars and fixed hedge positions.

Significant events of 2005

In March 2005, we entered into a contract for the operation of
ten new drilling rigs, each for a lease term of three years.
This arrangement supports our plan to accelerate the pace of
natural gas development in the Piceance basin through both
deployment of the additional rigs and also as a result of the
drilling and operational efficiencies the new rigs are designed
to deliver. We received our first two rigs in January and
February 2006, and they have begun drilling. Although we
originally expected to deploy one new rig per month beginning in
November 2005, delays occurred as construction was impacted by
the hurricanes experienced in the Gulf.

During the second quarter of 2005, we acquired an acreage
position with a few producing wells in the Fort Worth basin
in north-central Texas. In early January 2006, we increased our
position in this basin. Our entry into this basin allows us to
own an operated position that has potential for significant
growth. It increases our diversification into the Mid-Continent
region and allows us to use our horizontal drilling expertise to
develop wells in the Barnett Shale formation.



Outlook for 2006

Our expectations for 2006 include:

•

Continuing our development drilling program in our key basins of
    Piceance, Powder River, San Juan, and Arkoma. We have
    increased our planned capital expenditures for 2006 to between
    $950 million and $1.05 billion. The ten new drilling
    rigs are dedicated specifically to drilling activity in the
    Piceance basin.

•

Increasing our domestic average daily production level of
    612 MMcfe for the year ending December 31, 2005, by 15
    to 20 percent by the end of 2006.

Approximately 299 MMcfe of our forecasted 2006 daily
production of 750 to 825 MMcfe is hedged at prices that
average $3.82 per Mcfe at a basin level. In addition, we
entered into the following collar agreements:

•

NYMEX collar agreement for approximately 50 MMcfe per day
    of our 2006 production at a floor price of $6.50 per Mcfe
    and a ceiling price of $8.25 per Mcfe;

•

NYMEX collar agreement for approximately 15 MMcfe per day
    of our 2006 production at a floor price of $7.00 per Mcfe
    and a ceiling price of $9.00 per Mcfe;

•

Northwest Pipeline/ Rockies collar agreement for approximately
    50 MMcfe per day of our 2006 production at a floor price of
    $6.05 per Mcfe and a ceiling price of $7.90 per Mcfe
    at a basin level.

Risks to achieving our objectives include drilling rig
availability, including timely deliveries of the contracted new
rigs, as well as obtaining permits as planned for drilling.

2005 vs. 2004

The $491.5 million, or 63 percent increase in

revenues

is primarily due to an increase in domestic
production revenues of $434 million during 2005 reflecting
higher net realized average prices and higher production volumes
sold. Also contributing to the increase is a $58 million
increase in revenues from gas management activities and
$13 million increased production revenues from our
international operations. Partially offsetting these increases
is a $10 million loss due to hedge ineffectiveness.

The increase in domestic production revenues primarily results
from $319 million higher revenues associated with a
42 percent increase in net realized average prices for
production sold as well as a $115 million increase
associated with an 18 percent increase in average daily
production volumes. The higher net realized average prices
reflect the benefit of the lower volumes hedged in 2005 as
compared to 2004 coupled with higher market prices for natural
gas. The increase in production volumes primarily reflects an
increase in the number of producing wells resulting from our
successful 2005 drilling program.

To manage the commodity price risk and volatility of owning
producing gas properties, we enter into derivative forward sales
contracts that economically lock in a price relating to a
portion of our future production. Approximately 47 percent
of domestic production in 2005 was hedged at a weighted average
price of $3.99 per Mcfe at a basin level. In addition, we
entered into the following collar agreements for 2005:

•

NYMEX collar agreement for approximately 50 MMcfe per day
    for the first quarter of 2005 at a floor price of $7.50 per
    Mcfe and a ceiling price of $10.49 per Mcfe.



•

NYMEX collar agreement for approximately 50 MMcfe per day
    for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2005 at a floor
    price of $6.75 per Mcfe and a ceiling price of
    $8.50 per Mcfe.

•

Northwest Pipeline/ Rockies collar agreement for approximately
    50 MMcfe per day for the fourth quarter of 2005 at a floor
    price of $6.10 per Mcfe and a ceiling price of
    $7.70 per Mcfe at a basin level.

These hedges are executed with our Power segment which, in turn,
executes offsetting derivative contracts with unrelated third
parties. Generally, Power bears the counterparty performance
risks associated with unrelated third parties. Hedging decisions
are made considering our overall commodity risk exposure and are
not executed independently by Exploration & Production.

Total

costs and expenses

increased $147 million,
primarily due to the following:

These increased

costs and expenses

are partially offset
by the absence in 2005 of a $15.4 million loss provision
related to an ownership dispute on prior period production in
2004, a $7.9 million gain on the sale of an undeveloped
leasehold position in Colorado in the first quarter of 2005, and
a $21.7 million gain on the sale of certain outside
operated properties in the Powder River basin area of Wyoming in
the third quarter of 2005.

The $351.4 million increase in

segment profit

is
primarily due to increased revenues from higher volumes and
higher net realized average prices, as well as the gains on
sales of assets, partially offset by higher expenses as
discussed above.

Segment profit

also includes a
$19 million increase reflecting higher revenues and equity
earnings resulting from higher net realized oil and gas prices
primarily from our Apco Argentina operations.

2004 vs. 2003

The $2.1 million, or less than 1 percent, decrease in

revenues

is primarily due to the absence of
$24 million in income realized during 2003 from derivative
instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting, partially
offset by an increase in domestic production revenues of
$22 million during 2004. The increase in domestic
production revenues primarily results from $49 million
higher revenues associated with a 9 percent increase in
production volumes partially offset by $27 million lower
revenues associated with a 4 percent decrease in net
realized average prices for production sold. Net realized
average prices include the effect of hedge positions which were
at prices below market levels. The increase in production
volumes primarily reflects an increase in the number of
producing wells resulting from our successful 2004 drilling
program.

Approximately 77 percent of domestic production in 2004 was
hedged at a weighted average price of $3.65 per MMcfe at a
basin level.



Total

costs and expenses

increased $167 million,
which includes the absence of $95 million in net gains on
sales of assets occurring in 2003. The remaining increase in
costs and expenses primarily reflects:

The $165.6 million decrease in

segment profit

is due
primarily to the absence of $95 million in net gains on
sales of assets occurring in 2003, the increase in operating
expenses, and the loss provision of $15.4 million relating
to an ownership dispute on prior period production partially
offset by the $16 million gain attributable to the sales of
securities associated with our coal seam royalty trust that were
purchased for resale.

Segment profit

also includes
$25 million and $18 million related to international
activities for 2004 and 2003, respectively. This increase is
primarily driven by the improved operating results of Apco
Argentina.

Midstream Gas & Liquids

Overview of 2005

In 2005, Midstream’s ongoing strategy was to safely and
reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our
assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. Our
business is focused on consistently attracting new volumes to
our assets by providing highly reliable service to our customers.

The following factors influenced our business in 2005:

Formation of Williams Partners L.P.

In February 2005, we formed Williams Partners L.P., a limited
partnership, to complement our business strategy by providing
access to a lower cost of capital to further expand the scale of
our operations. On August 23, 2005, we completed our
initial public offering (IPO) of five million common units of
Williams Partners L.P. at a price of $21.50 per unit. The
underwriters also fully exercised their option to purchase an
additional 750,000 common units at the same price. Williams
Partners L.P. owns a 40 percent equity investment in the
Discovery gathering, transportation, processing and natural gas
liquids (NGL) fractionation system; the Carbonate Trend
sour gas gathering pipeline; three integrated NGL storage
facilities near Conway, Kansas; and a 50 percent interest
in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas. Upon completion of
the transaction, we held approximately 60 percent of the
limited partnership units in Williams Partners L.P. and
100 percent of the general partner, Williams Partners GP,
LLC.

Impact of hurricanes

Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina and Rita caused temporary shut-downs
of most of our facilities and our producers’ facilities in
the Gulf Coast region, which reduced product flows resulting in
lower segment profit of an estimated $17 million, which
includes our insured property damage deductible, in the second
half of 2005. Our major facilities resumed normal operations
shortly after the passage of each hurricane except for our
Devils Tower spar and Cameron Meadows gas processing plant. The
Devils Tower deepwater spar was shut in on August 27, 2005,
due to Hurricane Katrina and returned to service in early
November. The Cameron Meadows natural gas processing plant near
Johnson Bayou, Louisiana sustained significant damage from



Hurricane Rita on September 24, 2005. The plant returned to
limited service in February 2006. We are pursuing a business
interruption claim with our insurance carrier but have not
recognized any amounts related to this pending claim.

Expansion efforts in growth areas

Consistent with our strategy, we continued to expand our
Midstream operations where we have large scale assets in growth
basins. On October 5, 2005, we signed definitive agreements
to construct, own and operate a

37-mile

extension of
our oil and gas pipelines from our Devils Tower spar to the
Blind Faith prospect located in Mississippi Canyon. This
extension, estimated to cost $177 million, is expected to
be ready for service by the third quarter of 2007. Also, in
September we received Board approval to expand our existing gas
processing plant located near Opal, Wyoming, by adding a fifth
cryogenic train capable of processing up to 350 MMcfd. This
plant expansion is expected to be in service by the second
quarter of 2007 to begin processing gas from the Pinedale
Anticline field.

Favorable commodity price margins

The actual realized NGL per unit margins at our processing
plants exceeded Midstream’s historical five-year annual
average for the last six quarters. However, the industry
benchmark for NGL fractionation spreads at Mont Belvieu, Texas
was 40 percent below 2004 fractionation spreads. The
geographic diversification of Midstream assets contributed
significantly to our actual realized unit margins exceeding the
industry benchmark at Mont Belvieu for gas processing spreads.
The largest impact is realized at our western United States gas
processing plants, which benefit from lower regional market
natural gas prices. A decline in volumes in recent quarters is
largely due to the third quarter impact of summer hurricanes on
our Gulf Coast facilities as well as lower fourth quarter NGL
recoveries at our West region plants. The lower NGL recoveries
in the West were the result of intermittent periods in which the
spread between NGL and natural gas prices was such that it was
uneconomical to recover NGLs.

expense

above. These charges represent any overhead cost not
directly attributable to one of the specific asset groups noted
in this discussion.

2005 vs. 2004

The $350.1 million increase in Midstream’s

revenues

is largely due to higher commodity prices,
offset slightly by lower sales volumes. Revenues associated with
production of NGLs increased $72 million, of which
$180 million is due to higher NGL prices partially offset
by $108 million due to lower sales volumes. The



decline in sales volumes in our Gulf Coast region is largely due
to the impact of summer hurricanes, while the West region
decline is largely due to the higher levels of NGL rejection as
well as maintenance issues with our gas processing facility at
Opal, Wyoming. Crude marketing revenues increased
$196 million as a result of the start up of a deepwater
pipeline in the second quarter of 2004 while the marketing of
NGLs increased $58 million as a result of both higher
prices and additional spot sales. Both of these increases are
offset by similar increases in costs. In addition, fee revenues
increased $21 million in part due to higher customer
production volumes flowing to our West region and deepwater
assets.

Costs and operating expenses

increased
$364.1 million primarily in support of higher revenues
noted above. Costs related to the production of NGLs increased
$92 million as a result of $100 million in higher
natural gas purchases due largely to higher prices, partially
offset by lower volumes. In addition, operating expenses
increased $33 million mostly due to higher fuel expense and
commodity costs associated with our NGL storage and
fractionation business and higher depreciation expense. Similar
to the impact to

revenues

, total

costs and operating
expenses

also increased $196 million due to higher
crude marketing purchases and $58 million related to the
marketing of NGLs and additional spot purchases.

The $78.5 million decline in Midstream

segment profit

is primarily due to the absence of the $93.6 million
gain from the Gulf Liquids’ insurance arbitration award in
2004. The offsetting increase in segment profit is primarily due
to higher fee revenues from our gathering and processing and
Venezuela businesses and higher earnings from our investment in
the Discovery Partnership, partially offset by lower net NGL
margins and higher operating costs. A more detailed analysis of
the segment profit of Midstream’s various operations is
presented below.

Domestic gathering & processing

The $6.1 million decrease in

domestic gathering and
processing segment profit

includes a $30 million
decline in the Gulf Coast region, largely offset by a
$24 million increase in the West region.

The $24 million increase in our West region’s

segment profit

primarily results from higher gathering
and processing fee revenues, and the absence of an asset
write-down and other 2004 charges, offset partially by higher
operating expenses and lower net NGL margins. The significant
drivers to these items are as follows:

•

Gathering and processing fee revenues increased $18 million
    primarily as a result of higher average per-unit gathering and
    processing rates and higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain
    production area due to increased drilling activity. A portion of
    this increase is also due to the increase in volumes subject to
    fee-based processing contracts.

•

Other (income) expense — net

had a favorable
    variance of $10 million primarily due to the absence of the
    write-down of $7.6 million for an idle treating facility in
    2004.

•

Net NGL margins decreased $6 million due to a
    $17 million impact from a decline in sales volumes
    resulting from lower fourth quarter NGL recoveries caused by
    intermittent periods of uneconomical market commodity prices and
    a power outage and associated operational issues at our Opal,
    Wyoming facility. Net NGL margins are defined as NGL revenues
    less BTU replacement cost, plant fuel, transportation and
    fractionation expense. The impact of lower volumes is partially
    offset by an $11 million impact of higher per unit NGL
    margins.

The $30 million decrease in the Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

is primarily a result of higher operating
and depreciation expenses and lower net liquids margins. The
significant components of this decline include the following:

•

Operating expenses increased $10 million primarily due to
    higher maintenance expenses related to our gathering assets,
    compressor overhauls, and an increase in hurricane-related costs
    of $2 million. Inspection and repair expenses related to
    the hurricanes are being recorded as incurred up to the level of
    our insurance deductible.

•

Depreciation expense increased $13 million primarily due to
    placing in service our Devils Tower spar and associated
    deepwater gas and oil pipelines in May and June 2004,
    respectively.



•

Liquids margins declined $14 million due to lower volumes,
    largely due to the impact of summer hurricanes, and the increase
    in natural gas prices. While revenues from the Devils Tower
    deepwater facility are recognized as volumes are delivered over
    the life of the reserves, cash payments from our customers are
    based on a contractual fixed fee received over a defined term.
    As a result, $44 million of cash received in 2005, which is
    included in cash flow from operations, was deferred at
    December 31, 2005 and will be recognized as revenue in
    periods subsequent to 2005. The total amount deferred for all
    years as of December 31, 2005 was $80 million.

Venezuela

Segment profit

for our Venezuela assets increased
$9.1 million as a result of higher plant volumes and higher
equity earnings from our investment in the ACCROVEN partnership.
The higher equity earnings are largely due to the renegotiation
of a power supply contract and the absence of 2004 legal fees
associated with the Jose Terminal.

Other

The $71.7 million decrease in

segment profit

of our
other operations is largely due to the absence of the
$93.6 million gain from the Gulf Liquids’ insurance
arbitration award and a $9.5 million gain on the sale of
the Choctaw ethylene distribution assets in 2004 partially
offset by $7 million in higher olefins and commodity
margins, $6 million in higher earnings from our equity
investment in the Discovery partnership, and the absence of a
2004 $16.9 million impairment charge also related to our
equity investment in the Discovery partnership.

Unallocated general and administrative expense

The $9.8 million unfavorable variance for our

unallocated general and administrative expense

is
primarily due to higher employee expenses and administrative
costs associated with the creation of Williams Partners, L.P.

2004 vs. 2003

The $97.8 million increase in Midstream’s

revenues

is primarily the result of favorable commodity prices on our
gas processing and olefins businesses, largely offset by lower
trading revenues resulting from the fourth-quarter 2003 sale of
our wholesale propane business. Revenues associated with
production of NGLs increased $417 million, of which
$214 million is due to higher volumes and $203 million
is due to higher NGL prices. Olefins revenues increased
$223 million as a result of both higher market prices and
higher volumes. In addition, our deepwater service revenues
increased $9 million due to the addition of new
infrastructure. Other factors affecting total revenues include
approximately $1 billion in lower trading revenues
resulting from the fourth-quarter 2003 sale of our wholesale
propane business, partially offset by a $263 million
increase as the result of marketing NGLs on behalf of our
customers. Before 2004, our purchases of customers’ NGLs
were netted within revenues. In 2004, these purchases of
customers’ NGLs are included in costs and operating
expenses which substantially offset the change in revenues. Of
this $263 million increase, approximately $146 million
results from the difference in financial reporting presentation;
the remaining increase is due to higher NGL volumes and prices.
Also partially offsetting the lower trading revenues is
$141 million in higher crude sales associated with the 2004
startup of one of our deepwater pipelines, which is offset in
costs and operating expenses.

Costs and operating expenses

decreased $56 million
primarily as a result of approximately $1 billion in lower
trading costs due to the sale of our wholesale propane business
in 2003. This decline was partially offset by $312 million
in higher costs related to the production of NGLs and
$157 million in higher costs related to the production of
olefins products. These costs increased as a result of both the
higher production volumes noted above and the higher prices for
natural gas and olefins feedstock. Maintenance and depreciation
expenses increased $33 million in large part due to newly
constructed deepwater assets. Similar to the impact to revenues,
total costs and operating expenses increased $263 million
due to the marketing of NGLs on behalf of customers and
$141 million in higher crude purchases related to the same
deepwater pipeline mentioned above.



The $352.4 million increase in Midstream

segment profit

includes the $93.6 million gain from the Gulf
Liquids’ insurance arbitration award in 2004 and the
absence of a $108.7 million impairment charge in 2003
related to these same assets, both of which are included in

other (income) expense — net,

within

operating income.

The remaining increase in

segment
profit

is primarily due to higher NGL and olefins production
volume and unit margins, higher service revenues, and reduced
general and administrative expenses. These increases are
partially offset by higher operating expenses and asset
impairment charges. A more detailed analysis of

segment
profit

of Midstream’s various operations is presented
below.

Domestic gathering & processing

The $71.7 million increase in

domestic gathering and
processing segment profit

includes a $64.1 million
increase in the West region and a $7.6 million increase in
the Gulf Coast region.

The $64.1 million increase in our West region’s

segment profit

reflects higher NGL volume and unit
margins offset by lower fee revenues and higher operating
expenses. Our West region’s net NGL margins for 2004
increased $69 million compared to the same period in 2003.
Net NGL margins are defined as NGL revenues less BTU replacement
cost, plant fuel, transportation and fractionation expense.
Average per unit NGL margins increased 49 percent and
comprised $51 million of the increase in NGL margins. As a
result of the higher spread between the prices of NGLs and
natural gas, our West plants operated at near capacity and
produced 21 percent higher volumes comprising the remaining
$18 million increase in NGL net margins.

The $7.6 million increase in our Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

is due to higher NGL margins partially
offset by lower fee revenues and higher depreciation expense.
The significant components of the net increase include the
following:

•

Net NGL margins at our Gulf Coast gas processing plants
    increased $35 million due to a 101 percent increase in
    NGL production volumes which represented $28 million of the
    increase in margins. The significantly higher NGL volumes were
    driven by the favorable spread between NGL and natural gas
    prices coupled with the recently completed production handling
    infrastructure flowing additional deepwater gas production to
    our plants. Per unit margins in the Gulf Coast region increased
    13 percent and comprised the remaining $7 million
    increase in net NGL margins.

•

Segment profit

from our deepwater assets declined
    $20 million primarily due to $29 million in higher
    costs associated with assets placed into service in the first
    two quarters of 2004 partially offset by $9 million in
    higher services revenues. The increase in

revenues

includes $22 million in incremental revenues from newly
    constructed assets partially offset by a $13 million
    decline in handling and gathering revenues due to lower
    production volumes on other deepwater assets substantially
    resulting from the effects of Hurricane Ivan. While revenues
    from the Devils Tower deepwater facility are recognized as
    volumes are delivered over the life of the reserves, cash
    payments from our customers are based on a contractual fixed fee
    received over a defined term. As a result, $36 million of
    cash received, which is included in cash flow from operations,
    was deferred at December 31, 2004 and will be recognized as
    revenue in periods subsequent to 2004.

Venezuela

The $9.2 million increase in

segment profit

for our
Venezuelan assets is primarily due to the absence of the
financial impact of a fire at the El Furrial facility that
reduced revenues by $10 million in the first quarter of
2003.

Other

The $273.4 million increase in

segment profit

in our
other businesses includes the $93.6 million Gulf Liquids
insurance arbitration award and the absence of
$108.7 million in Gulf Liquids impairment charges in 2003.
The remaining increase is comprised of the following:

•

Combined margins from our olefins businesses improved
    $66 million reflecting the overall improvement in olefins
    pricing and higher production volumes. Market prices for
    ethylene and propylene products increased due to higher demand
    and lower inventories. Production volumes increased as a



result of increased spot sales and the new higher fixed margin
    contract at our Giesmar facility while our Canadian and Gulf
    Liquids volumes benefited from improved plant operations.

•

The favorable variances above are partially offset by a 2004
    $16.9 million impairment charge related to our equity
    investment in the Discovery partnership, reflecting
    management’s assessment that there was an
    other-than-temporary decline in the value of this investment.

Other

Overview of 2005

As discussed below, the $105 million 2005 Other

segment
loss

is primarily associated with our equity method
investment in Longhorn. Shipping volumes on the Longhorn
pipeline declined significantly during the second quarter of
2005 compared to those experienced in the first quarter. The
decline was due primarily to the impact of significant changes
in transportation pricing competition and economics in the wake
of significantly higher crude oil prices. Longhorn management
indicated that the shortfall in volumes was likely to continue
and that continued operation as originally planned was no longer
economically feasible. As a result, the owners and management of
Longhorn began evaluating several alternatives for the future
operation of Longhorn.

To ensure adequate liquidity to continue operations while
assessing alternatives, during the third quarter of 2005
Longhorn obtained a $25 million bridge loan commitment from
existing investors. The loan is secured by a first lien on the
assets of Longhorn. We have fully funded our $10 million
commitment of this loan, which has a one-year term and an
interest rate of 14 percent. Our receivable related to this
loan is included in

accounts and notes receivable

on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The loan agreement allows for an
additional $25 million loan, secured by the same first lien
on the assets of Longhorn. All existing investors will have the
opportunity to participate in funding the second
$25 million increment. We do not expect to participate as a
lender in this additional increment.

Based on management’s outlook for Longhorn at the end of
the second quarter, we assessed our investment in Longhorn to
determine if there had been an other-than-temporary decline in
its fair value. As a result, we recorded an impairment of
$49.1 million during the second quarter of 2005. In the
fourth quarter of 2005, management of Longhorn decided to pursue
a strategy of the sale of Longhorn. As a result, Longhorn is
negotiating a purchase and sale agreement. Based on initial
indications from potential buyers, we determined that our
Longhorn investment would require full impairment. Therefore, in
fourth quarter 2005, we recorded a $38.1 million impairment
to write off the remaining investment in Longhorn.

On April 1, 2005, we completed a contract to transfer our
Longhorn operating agreement to a new operator in exchange for
payments of approximately $285,000 a month, adjusted for
inflation, over the next seven years. The transfer became
effective May 1, 2005. Realization of the Longhorn
operating agreement payments is dependent upon the continued
operation of Longhorn. Any payments received as a result of the
ongoing payment stream or through monetization of the contract
will be recognized as income when received.

Outlook for 2006

Projected volumes indicate that Longhorn will continue to
operate at a loss until a sale is complete. However, as a result
of the full write-off of our investment in Longhorn during the
fourth quarter of 2005, we will no longer recognize equity
losses associated with this investment. We currently expect to
receive full payment on the $10 million bridge loan from
the proceeds of the sale.

As the table above illustrates, we are not materially engaged in
trading activities. However, we hold a substantial portfolio of
nontrading derivative contracts. Nontrading derivative contracts
are those that hedge or could possibly hedge on an economic
basis forecasted transactions. We have designated certain of
these contracts as cash flow hedges of Power’s forecasted
purchases of gas, and purchases and sales of power related to
its long-term structured contracts and owned generation and
Exploration & Production’s forecasted sales of
natural gas production. We began applying cash flow hedge
accounting in our Power business in the fourth quarter of 2004,
after we decided to cease efforts to exit and to continue to
operate the Power business. Many of these derivatives had an
existing fair value prior to their designation as cash flow
hedges. Certain of Power’s other derivatives have not been
designated as or do not qualify as SFAS 133 cash flow
hedges. The chart below reflects the fair value of derivatives
held for nontrading purposes as of December 31, 2005, for
both the Power and Exploration & Production businesses.
Of the total fair value of nontrading derivatives, SFAS 133
cash flow hedges had a net liability value of $6 million as
of December 31, 2005, which includes the existing fair
value of the derivatives at the time of their designation as
SFAS 133 cash flow hedges.

Methods of Estimating Fair Value

Most of the derivatives we hold settle in active periods and
markets in which quoted market prices are available. These
include futures contracts, option contracts, swap agreements and
physical commodity purchases and sales in the commodity markets
in which we transact. While an active market may not exist for
the entire period, quoted prices can generally be obtained for
natural gas through 2012 and power through 2010.

These prices reflect current economic and regulatory conditions
and may change because of market conditions. The availability of
quoted market prices in active markets varies between periods
and commodities based upon changes in market conditions. The
ability to obtain quoted market prices also varies greatly from
region to region. The time periods noted above are an estimation
of aggregate availability of quoted prices. An immaterial
portion of our total net derivative value of $102 million
relates to periods in which active quotes cannot be obtained. We
estimate energy commodity prices in these illiquid periods by
incorporating information about commodity prices in actively
quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets, and other
market fundamental analysis. Modeling and other valuation
techniques, however, are not used significantly in determining
the fair value of our derivatives.



Counterparty Credit Considerations

We include an assessment of the risk of counterparty
nonperformance in our estimate of fair value for all contracts.
Such assessment considers (1) the credit rating of each
counterparty as represented by public rating agencies such as
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors
Service, (2) the inherent default probabilities within
these ratings, (3) the regulatory environment that the
contract is subject to and (4) the terms of each individual
contract.

Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could
ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows.
We continually assess this risk. We have credit protection
within various agreements to call on additional collateral
support if necessary. At December 31, 2005, we held
collateral support, including letters of credit, of
$607 million.

We also enter into netting agreements to mitigate counterparty
performance and credit risk. During 2005 and 2004, we did not
incur any significant losses due to recent counterparty
bankruptcy filings.

December 31, 2005, is summarized below.

We determine investment grade primarily using publicly available
    credit ratings. We included counterparties with a minimum
    Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB- or Moody’s
    Investors Service rating of Baa3 in investment grade. We also
    classify counterparties that have provided sufficient
    collateral, such as cash, standby letters of credit, adequate
    parent company guarantees, and property interests, as investment
    grade.

Trading Policy

We have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk
management activities. These policies cover authority and
delegation thereof in addition to control requirements,
authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations.
Power’s value-at-risk is limited in aggregate and
calculated at a 95 percent confidence level.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition

Outlook

We believe we have, or have access to, the financial resources
and liquidity necessary to meet future requirements for
working-capital, capital and investment expenditures and debt
payments while maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity to
reasonably protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring
the use of funds. In 2006, we expect to continue to reduce debt
through scheduled debt payments and exchanges, while maintaining
liquidity from cash and unused revolving credit facilities of at
least $1 billion. We are maintaining this level as we
consider the potential impact of significant changes in
commodity prices, contract margin requirements above current
levels, unplanned capital spending needs and the need to meet
near term scheduled debt payments. We expect to fund capital and
investment expenditures, debt payments, dividends, and
working-capital requirements through cash flow from operations,
which is currently estimated to be between $1.6 billion and
$1.9 billion in 2006, proceeds from debt issuances and
sales of units of Williams Partners, L.P., as well as cash
and cash equivalents on hand as needed.

We enter 2006 positioned for growth through disciplined
investments in our natural gas businesses. Examples of this
planned growth include:

•

Gas Pipeline will continue to expand its system to meet the
    demand of growth markets. Additionally, Northwest Pipeline will
    construct an 80 mile pipeline loop, which will replace most
    of the capacity previously served by 268 miles of pipeline
    in the Washington state area.

•

Exploration & Production’s March 2005 operating
    lease agreement will provide access to ten new drilling rigs
    each for a lease term of three years that will allow us to
    accelerate the pace of developing our natural gas reserves in
    the Piceance basin through both deployment of the additional
    rigs and the rigs’ designed drilling and operational
    efficiencies. We received our first two rigs in January and
    February 2006 and they have begun drilling.

•

Midstream will continue to pursue significant deepwater
    production commitments and expand capacity in the western United
    States.

We estimate capital and investment expenditures will total
approximately $2 billion to $2.2 billion in 2006. Of
the total estimated capital expenditures for 2006,
$950 million to $1.1 billion is for capital
expenditures at Exploration & Production. Also within
the total estimated expenditures for 2006 is approximately
$616 million to $681 million for maintenance-related
projects at Gas Pipeline, including pipeline replacement and
Clean Air Act compliance. Commitments for construction and
acquisition of property, plant and equipment are approximately
$222 million at December 31, 2005.

In November 2005, we initiated an offer to induce conversion of
up to $300 million of the 5.5 percent junior
subordinated convertible debentures into our common stock. The
conversion was executed in January 2006 and approximately
$220.2 million of the debentures were exchanged for common
stock. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

We have proposed to sell an approximate 25 percent interest
in our gathering and processing assets in the Four Corners area
to Williams Partners L.P. The terms of this proposed
transaction, including price, will be subject to the approval of
our board of directors and the board of directors of the general
partner of Williams Partners L.P.

Potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity
and the planned capital and investment expenditures discussed
above include:

•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations due to
    commodity pricing volatility.

To mitigate this exposure, Exploration & Production has
    economically hedged the price of natural gas for approximately
    414 MMcfe per day of its expected 2006 production of 750 to
    825 MMcfe per day. Power has entered into fixed forward
    sales contracts that economically cover substantially all of its
    fixed demand obligations through 2010.



•

Sensitivity of margin requirements associated with our
    marginable commodity contracts.

As of December 2005, we estimate our exposure to additional
    margin requirements over the next 360 days to be no more
    than $567 million, using a statistical analysis at a
    99 percent confidence level.

•

Exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and
    litigation issues (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements).

Overview

Liquidity

Our internal and external sources of liquidity include cash
generated from our operations, bank financings, proceeds from
asset sales and issuance of long-term debt and equity
securities. While most of our sources are available to us at the
parent level, others are available to certain of our
subsidiaries, including equity issuances from Williams Partners,
L.P. Our ability to raise funds in the capital markets will be
impacted by our financial condition, interest rates, market
conditions, and industry conditions.

    such debt is guaranteed by us.

Financial ratios and credit ratings

One of our objectives for 2006 is to continue the improvement in
our financial ratios, with the ultimate goal of achieving ratios
comparable to investment grade rated companies at some point in
the future. Our

end-of

-year debt to
capitalization ratio is 58.7 percent in 2005,
61.6 percent in 2004 and 74.5 percent in 2003. We
expect the ratio to be 55 to 57 percent for 2006. Debt
includes

long-term debt

and

long-term debt due within
one year

. Capitalization includes

long-term debt due
within one year, long-term debt

, and

stockholders’



equity

. If the improvement in our ratios continues, our
credit ratings may improve. However, a decline in our financial
ratios, or other adverse events, could result in a ratings
decline. Current ratings are:

In mid-2005, Standard & Poor’s raised our debt ratings
outlook from stable to positive. With respect to Standard &
Poor’s, a rating of “BBB” or above indicates an
investment grade rating. A rating below “BBB”
indicates that the security has significant speculative
characteristics. A “B” rating indicates that Standard
and Poor’s believes the issuer has the capacity to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation, but that adverse
business, financial or economic conditions will likely impair
the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial
commitment to the obligation. Standard and Poor’s may
modify its ratings with a “+” or a “-” sign
to show the obligor’s relative standing within a major
rating category.

With respect to Moody’s, a rating of “Baa” or
above indicates an investment grade rating. A rating below
“Baa” is considered to have speculative elements. A
“Ba” ranking indicates an obligation that is judged to
have speculative elements and is subject to substantial credit
risk. A “B” rating from Moody’s signifies an
obligation that is considered speculative and is subject to high
credit risk. The “1”, “2” and “3”
modifiers show the relative standing within a major category. A
“1” indicates that an obligation ranks in the higher
end of the broad rating category, “2” indicating a
mid-range ranking, and “3” ranking at the lower end of
the category.

In March 2006, Fitch raised our debt ratings outlook from stable
to positive. With respect to Fitch, a rating of “BBB”
or above indicates an investment grade rating. A rating below
“BBB” is considered speculative grade. A
“BB” rating from Fitch indicates that there is a
possibility of credit risk developing, particularly as the
result of adverse economic change over time; however, business
or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial
commitments to be met. Fitch may add a “+” or a
“-” sign to show the obligor’s relative standing
within a major rating category.

Operating Activities

Our 2005

net cash provided by operating activities

decreased slightly from 2004 and increased by
88 percent from 2003. A primary driver in

net cash
provided by operating activities

is

income from
continuing operations,

which increased primarily as a result
of higher gas production volumes and net average realized prices
for production sold. Refer to Results of Operations in
Item 7 for more detailed information regarding

income
from continuing operations

. Also contributing to the
increase in income from continuing operations is the reduction
in interest expense due to lower average borrowing levels. Cash
payments for interest decreased $224 million from 2004. In
addition to the changes in results of operations, net cash
inflows from margin deposits and customer margin deposits
payable decreased significantly from 2004. In 2004, our Power



subsidiary issued a significant number of letters of credit to
replace its cash margin deposits. As the letters of credit were
issued, the counterparties returned our cash margin deposits to
us. Due to fewer letters of credit being issued to replace cash
margin deposits in 2005 and 2003, we have fewer receipts of
margin deposits than in 2004.

Other, including changes in noncurrent assets and
liabilities,

includes contributions to our tax-qualified
pension plans of $52.1 million, $136.8 million and
$42.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. It is
our policy to make annual contributions to our tax-qualified
pension plans in an amount equal to the greater of the
actuarially computed annual normal cost plus any unfunded
actuarial accrued liability, amortized over approximately five
years, or the minimum required contribution under existing tax
laws. Additional amounts may be contributed to increase the
funded status of the plans. In an effort to strengthen our
funded status and take advantage of strong cash flows, we
contributed approximately $41.1 million more than our
funding policy required in 2005 and $98.9 million more than
our funding policy required in 2004.

Financing Activities

During 2005, our

net cash provided (used) by financing
activities

was a source of cash as compared to a use in 2004
and 2003. During 2005, we received approximately
$273 million reported in

proceeds from issuance of
common stock

resulting from the exercise of the FELINE PACS
equity forward contracts.

Payments of long-term debt

was
significantly lower in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to
the substantial completion of our debt reduction strategy in
2004. During January 2005, we retired $200 million of
6.125 percent notes issued by Transco, which matured
January 15, 2005. During August 2005, we completed an
initial public offering of approximately 40 percent of our
interest in Williams Partners L.P. resulting in net proceeds of
$111 million reported as

proceeds from sale of limited
partner units of consolidated partnership

. During 2004, we
repaid long-term debt through tender offers and early
retirements. We also reduced our debt through our FELINE PACS
exchange. This noncash exchange resulted in payments of fees and
expenses reported as

premiums paid on tender offer, early
debt retirements and FELINE PACS exchange

. During 2003, we
repurchased our outstanding 9.875 percent cumulative
convertible preferred shares. We also repaid the RMT note
payable and we refinanced our long-term debt at more favorable
rates. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for more detailed information regarding financing
activities.

Dividends paid on common stock were increased from $.05 to
$.075 per common share in third-quarter 2005 and totaled
$143 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Investing Activities

During 2005, our

net cash provided (used) by investing
activities

was a use of cash as compared to a source in 2004
and 2003. During 2005, we received $310.5 million in
proceeds from the Gulfstream recapitalization. In January 2005,
Northwest Pipeline received an $87.9 million contract
termination payment, representing reimbursement of the net book
value of the related assets. Refer to Gas Pipeline in Results of
Operations in Item 7 for more information on the contract
termination. In 2004, we sold all of our restricted investments
resulting in proceeds of $851.4 million. Since our
$800 million revolving and letter of credit facility that
required 105 percent cash collateral has been replaced with
a new revolving credit facility in January 2005, we are no
longer required to hold the restricted investments. In 2004 and
2003, we had numerous asset sales resulting in proceeds in 2004
and 2003 of $877.8 million and $2,250.5 million,
respectively. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for more detailed information regarding investing
activities.



In 2005, we began the year positioned for growth and have used
additional cash flow for capital expenditures primarily at
Exploration & Production. See a detail of capital
expenditures by segment below.

Capital Expenditures

(Millions)

•

Exploration & Production made capital expenditures in
    2005 primarily for development drilling in the Piceance basin.

•

Gas Pipeline made capital expenditures in 2005 primarily for
    normal maintenance and compliance.

•

Midstream Gas & Liquids made capital expenditures in
    2005 primarily for further expanding our systems in existing
    basins.

Off-balance sheet financing arrangements and guarantees of
    debt or other commitments

In January 2005, we terminated our two unsecured revolving and
letter of credit facilities totaling $500 million and
replaced them with two new facilities that contain similar terms
but fewer restrictions. In September 2005, we also entered into
two new revolving and letter of credit facilities that have a
similar structure (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

We have provided a guarantee for obligations of Williams
Partners L.P. under the $1.275 billion secured revolving
and letter of credit facility.

We have various other guarantees and commitments which are
disclosed in Notes 3, 10, 11, 14, and 15 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not believe these
guarantees or the possible fulfillment of them will prevent us
from meeting our liquidity needs.



Contractual Obligations

The table below summarizes the maturity dates of our contractual
obligations by period.

Effects of Inflation

Our operations in recent years have benefited from relatively
low inflation rates. Approximately 48 percent of our gross
property, plant and equipment is at Gas Pipeline and
approximately 52 percent is at other operating units. Gas
Pipeline is subject to regulation, which limits recovery to
historical cost. While amounts in excess of historical cost are
not recoverable under current FERC practices, we anticipate
being allowed to recover and earn a return based on increased
actual cost incurred to replace existing assets. Cost-



based regulation, along with competition and other market
factors, may limit our ability to recover such increased costs.
For the other operating units, operating costs are influenced to
a greater extent by specific price changes in oil and natural
gas and related commodities than by changes in general
inflation. Crude, refined product, natural gas, natural gas
liquids and power prices are particularly sensitive to OPEC
production levels and/or the market perceptions concerning the
supply and demand balance in the near future. However, our
exposure to these price changes is reduced through the use of
hedging instruments.

Environmental

We are a participant in certain environmental activities in
various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations
and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we
currently do not own (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements). We are monitoring these sites in a
coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other
governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable
along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities
and solely responsible in others. Current estimates of the most
likely costs of such activities are approximately
$64 million, all of which are recorded as liabilities on
our balance sheet at December 31, 2005. We will seek
recovery of approximately $18 million of the accrued costs
through future natural gas transmission rates. The remainder of
these costs will be funded from operations. During 2005, we paid
approximately $9 million for cleanup and/or remediation and
monitoring activities. We expect to pay approximately
$15 million in 2006 for these activities. Estimates of the
most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed
assessment studies, preliminary results of studies or our
experience with other similar cleanup operations. At
December 31, 2005, certain assessment studies were still in
process for which the ultimate outcome may yield significantly
different estimates of most likely costs. Therefore, the actual
costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type and extent
of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup
standards mandated by the EPA or other governmental authorities,
and other factors.

We are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and to the federal
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which require the EPA to issue
new regulations. We are also subject to regulation at the state
and local level. In September 1998, the EPA promulgated rules
designed to mitigate the migration of ground-level ozone in
certain states. In March 2004 and June 2004, the EPA promulgated
additional regulation regarding hazardous air pollutants, which
may impose additional controls. Capital expenditures necessary
to install emission control devices on our Transco gas pipeline
system to comply with rules were approximately $72 million
in 2005 and are estimated to be between $40 million and
$45 million subsequent to 2005. The actual costs incurred
will depend on the final implementation plans developed by each
state to comply with these regulations. We consider these costs
on our Transco system associated with compliance with these
environmental laws and regulations to be prudent costs incurred
in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, recoverable
through its rates.

Our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to
our debt portfolio. The majority of our debt portfolio is
comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of
fluctuations in interest rates. The maturity of our long-term
debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected life of
our operating assets.

The tables below provide information about our interest rate
risk-sensitive instruments as of December 31, 2005 and
2004. Long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash
flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average
interest rates by expected maturity dates. The fair value of our
publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative
year-end traded bond market prices. Private debt is valued based
on the prices of similar securities with similar terms and
credit ratings.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price
of natural gas, electricity, refined products and natural gas
liquids, as well as other market factors, such as market
volatility and commodity price correlations, including
correlations between crude oil and gas prices and between
natural gas and power prices. We are exposed to these risks in
connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term
energy-related contracts and our proprietary trading activities.
We manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations
using various derivatives and non-derivative energy-related
contracts. The fair value of derivative contracts is subject to
changes in energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and
volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted,
and changes in interest rates. We measure the risk in our
portfolios using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the
potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of
the portfolios.

Value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not
necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that
could be incurred from the portfolios. Our value-at-risk model
uses a Monte Carlo method to



simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and
assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there
is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair
value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk. The
simulation method uses historical correlations and market
forward prices and volatilities. In applying the value-at-risk
methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical
movements affect the positions or would cause any potential
liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio
in response to market conditions could affect market prices and
could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute.
While a one-day holding period has historically been the
industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately
represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our
own credit and liquidity constraints.

We segregate our derivative contracts into trading and
nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. We
calculate value at risk separately for these two categories.
Derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales
under SFAS 133 and nonderivative energy contracts have been
excluded from our estimation of value at risk.

Trading

Our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered
into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity
price-risk exposure. Only contracts that meet the definition of
a derivative are carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Our
value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was
approximately $4 million at December 31, 2005, and
$1 million at December 31, 2004. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, our value at risk for these contracts
ranged from a high of $6 million to a low of
$1 million.

Nontrading

Our nontrading portfolio consists of contracts that hedge or
could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the
following activities:

Segment

Commodity Price Risk Exposure

Exploration & Production

• Natural gas sales

Midstream

• Natural gas purchases

Power

• Natural gas purchases and sales

• Electricity purchases and sales

The value at risk for contracts held for nontrading purposes was
$17 million at December 31, 2005, and $29 million
at December 31, 2004. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, our value at risk for these contracts
ranged from a high of $34 million to a low of
$17 million. Certain of the contracts held for nontrading
purposes are accounted for as cash flow hedges under
SFAS 133. We do not consider the underlying commodity
positions to which the cash flow hedges relate in our
value-at-risk model. Therefore, value at risk does not represent
economic losses that could occur on a total nontrading portfolio
that includes the underlying commodity positions.

Foreign Currency Risk

We have international investments that could affect our
financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline
in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates and/or the economic conditions in foreign countries.

International investments accounted for under the cost method
totaled $45 million and $52 million at
December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively. These
investments are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for
which it is not practicable to estimate fair value. We believe
that we can realize the carrying value of these investments
considering the status of the operations of the companies
underlying these investments. If a 20 percent change
occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these
investments against the U.S. dollar, the fair value at
December 31, 2005, could change by approximately
$9.1 million assuming a direct correlation between the
currency fluctuation and the value of the investments.



Net assets of consolidated foreign operations whose functional
currency is the local currency are located primarily in Canada
and approximate six percent of our net assets at
December 31, 2005, and 2004. These foreign operations do
not have significant transactions or financial instruments
denominated in other currencies. However, these investments do
have the potential to impact our financial position, due to
fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process
of re-measuring the local functional currency into the
U.S. dollar. As an example, a 20 percent change in the
respective functional currencies against the U.S. dollar
could have changed

stockholders’ equity

by
approximately $62 million at December 31, 2005.



Item 8.

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

Williams’ management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in
Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorization of our management and
board of directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a
material effect on our financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of Williams’
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the
design of our internal control over financial reporting and
testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. Based on our assessment we believe
that, as of December 31, 2005, Williams’ internal
control over financial reporting is effective based on those
criteria.

Ernst & Young, LLP, our independent registered public
accounting firm, has issued an audit report on our assessment of
the company’s internal control over financial reporting. A
copy of this report is included in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that The Williams Companies, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). The Williams Companies, Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that The Williams
Companies, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, The Williams Companies, Inc. maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheet of The Williams Companies, Inc. as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005 of The Williams Companies, Inc. and our
report dated March 6, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Operations of our company are located principally in the United
States and are organized into the following reporting segments:
Power, Gas Pipeline, Exploration & Production, and
Midstream.

Power is an energy services provider that buys, sells, stores,
and transports energy and energy-related commodities, primarily
power and natural gas, on a wholesale level. Power focuses on
its objectives of minimizing financial risk, maximizing cash
flow, meeting contractual commitments, executing new contracts
to hedge its portfolio, and providing commodity marketing and
supply functions that support our natural gas businesses.

Gas Pipeline is comprised primarily of two interstate natural
gas pipelines, as well as investments in natural gas
pipeline-related companies. The Gas Pipeline operating segments
have been aggregated for reporting purposes and include
Northwest Pipeline, which extends from the San Juan basin
in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado to Oregon
and Washington, and Transco, which extends from the Gulf of
Mexico region to the northeastern United States. In addition, we
own a 50 percent interest in Gulfstream. Gulfstream is a
natural gas pipeline system extending from the Mobile Bay area
in Alabama to markets in Florida.

Exploration & Production includes natural gas
development, production and gas management activities primarily
in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
States and in Argentina.

Midstream is comprised of natural gas gathering and processing
and treating facilities in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast
regions of the United States, oil gathering and transportation
facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the United States,
majority-owned natural gas compression and transportation
facilities in Venezuela, and assets in Canada, consisting
primarily of a natural gas liquids extraction facility and a
fractionation plant.

Basis of Presentation

The following are presented as discontinued operations in our
financial statements (see Note 2):



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

•

Refining, retail and pipeline operations in Alaska, part of the
    previously reported Petroleum Services segment;

•

Straddle plants in western Canada, previously part of the
    Midstream segment.

We have restated all segment information in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for all prior periods
presented to reflect the discontinued operations noted
previously. Certain other amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current classifications.

Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing
operations.

At December 31, 2004, all of the assets and liabilities of
Gulf Liquids, which are not material to our Consolidated Balance
Sheet, were classified as held for sale and included in

other
current assets and deferred charges

and

accrued
liabilities

. In second-quarter 2005, we decided to retain a
portion of the Gulf Liquids operations and reclassified certain
of the assets and liabilities from held for sale to held for
use. The sale of the remaining assets held for sale closed on
July 15, 2005.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
our corporate parent and our majority-owned subsidiaries and
investments. We apply the equity method of accounting for
investments in companies in which we and our subsidiaries own 20
to 50 percent of the voting interest, or otherwise exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies of
the company.

Use of estimates

Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Significant estimates and assumptions include:

These estimates are discussed further throughout the
accompanying notes.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents

includes demand and time
deposits, certificates of deposit, and other marketable
securities with maturities of three months or less when acquired.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Restricted cash

Restricted cash

within

current assets

consists
primarily of collateral required by certain loan agreements for
our Venezuelan operations, escrow accounts established to fund
payments required by Power’s California settlement (see
Note 15), and an escrow account used to collect and manage
margin dollars.

Restricted cash

within noncurrent assets
relates primarily to certain borrowings by our Venezuelan
operations and letters of credit. We do not expect this cash to
be released within the next twelve months. The current and
noncurrent

restricted cash

is primarily invested in
short-term money market accounts with financial institutions.

The classification of

restricted cash

is determined based
on the expected term of the collateral requirement and not
necessarily the maturity date of the investment vehicle.

Auction rate securities

Auction rate securities are instruments with long-term
underlying maturities, but for which an auction is conducted
periodically, as specified, to reset the interest rate and allow
investors to buy or sell the instruments. Because auctions
generally occur more often than annually, and because we hold
these investments in order to meet short-term liquidity needs,
we classify auction rate securities as short-term and include
them in

other current assets and deferred charges

on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Consistent with our other securities
that are classified as available-for-sale, our Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows reflects the gross amount of the

purchases of auction rate securities

and the

proceeds
from sales of auction rate securities

.

Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable

are carried on a gross basis, with no
discounting, less the allowance for doubtful accounts. We do not
accrue a standard allowance when revenue is recognized. We
estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on existing
economic conditions, the financial conditions of the customers
and the amount and age of past due accounts. Receivables are
considered past due if full payment is not received by the
contractual due date. Interest income related to past due
accounts receivable is generally recognized at the time full
payment is received or collectibility is assured. Past due
accounts are generally written off against the allowance for
doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been
exhausted.

Inventory valuation

All

inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or
market. We determine the cost of certain natural gas inventories
held by Transco using the

last-in,

first-out
(LIFO) cost method. We determine the cost of the remaining
inventories primarily using the average-cost method.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment

is recorded at cost. We
base the carrying value of these assets on estimates,
assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized costs, useful
lives and salvage values.

As regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco provide
for depreciation using the straight-line method at
FERC-prescribed rates. Depreciation rates used for major
regulated gas plant facilities for all years presented, are as
follows:

Category of Property

Depreciation Rates

Gathering facilities

0% - 3.80%

Storage facilities

1.05% - 2.50%

Onshore transmission facilities

2.35% - 5.00%

Offshore transmission facilities

0.85% - 1.50%



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Depreciation for nonregulated entities is provided primarily on
the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, except as
noted below for oil and gas exploration and production
activities. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Estimated

Useful Lives

Category of Property

(In years)

Natural gas gathering and processing facilities

10 to 40

Power generation facilities


Transportation equipment

3 to 10

Building and improvements

10 to 45

Right of way

4 to 40

Office furnishings and computer software and hardware

3 to 20

Gains or losses from the ordinary sale or retirement of
property, plant and equipment for regulated pipelines are
credited or charged to accumulated depreciation; other gains or
losses are recorded in

other (income) expense — net

included in

operating income

.

Ordinary maintenance and repair costs are generally expensed as
incurred. Costs of major renewals and replacements are
capitalized as

property, plant, and equipment —
net

.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted
for under the successful efforts method. Costs incurred in
connection with the drilling and equipping of exploratory wells,
as applicable, are capitalized as incurred. If proved reserves
are not found, such costs are charged to expense. Other
exploration costs, including lease rentals, are expensed as
incurred. All costs related to development wells, including
related production equipment and lease acquisition costs, are
capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties are evaluated
annually, or as conditions warrant, to determine any impairment
in carrying value.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

is provided under the units of production method on a field
basis.

Proved properties, including developed and undeveloped, and
costs associated with unproven reserves, are assessed for
impairment using estimated future cash flows on a field basis.
Estimating future cash flows involves the use of complex
judgments such as estimation of the proved and unproven oil and
gas reserve quantities, risk associated with the different
categories of oil and gas reserves, timing of development and
production, expected future commodity prices, capital
expenditures, and production costs.

We record an asset and a liability equal to the present value of
each expected future asset retirement obligation (ARO). The ARO
asset is depreciated in a manner consistent with the
depreciation of the underlying physical asset. We measure
changes in the liability due to passage of time by applying an
interest method of allocation. This amount is recognized as an
increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as a
corresponding accretion expense included in

other (income)
expense — net

included in

operating income

,
except for regulated entities, for which the liability is offset
by a regulatory asset.

Goodwill

Goodwill

represents the excess of cost over fair value of
the assets of businesses acquired. It is evaluated annually for
impairment by first comparing our management’s estimate of
the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value,
including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, a computation of the implied fair value
of the goodwill is compared with its related carrying value. If
the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in the amount of the excess. We have

goodwill

of approximately $1 billion at December 31, 2005,
and 2004, at our Exploration & Production segment.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

When a reporting unit is sold or classified as held for sale,
any goodwill of that reporting unit is included in its carrying
value for purposes of determining any impairment or gain/loss on
sale. If a portion of a reporting unit with goodwill is sold or
classified as held for sale and that asset group represents a
business, a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill is
allocated to and included in the carrying value of that asset
group. None of the operations sold during 2005, 2004, and 2003
represented reporting units with goodwill or businesses within
reporting units to which goodwill was required to be allocated.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows used to determine the
estimate of the reporting unit’s fair value. The use of
alternate judgments and/or assumptions could result in the
recognition of different levels of impairment charges in the
financial statements.

Treasury stock

Treasury stock

purchases are accounted for under the cost
method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded
as treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance
of shares are credited or charged to

capital in excess of par
value

using the average-cost method.

Energy commodity risk management and trading activities

In 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 02-3
that rescinded EITF Issue No. 98-10, “Accounting for
Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities.” The consensus was applicable for fiscal
periods beginning after December 15, 2002, and we applied
the consensus effective January 1, 2003. As a result,
beginning in 2003, we no longer apply fair value accounting to
(1) energy and energy-related contracts that are not
derivatives as defined in SFAS No. 133 and
(2) physical commodity trading inventories. We reported the
initial application of the consensus as a

cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle

, reducing

net income
(loss)

by $762.5 million, net of a $471.4 million
benefit for income taxes. The charge primarily consisted of the
fair value of energy-related contracts, such as power tolling
contracts, full requirements contracts, load serving contracts,
storage contracts, transportation contracts and transmission
contracts. These energy-related contracts do not meet the
definition of a derivative and thus, beginning January 1,
2003, were no longer reported at fair value, but were rather
reported under the accrual basis of accounting. The cumulative
effect charge also included the amount by which the
December 31, 2002, fair value of physical commodity trading
inventories exceeded cost. We continue to carry derivatives at
fair value. See further discussion on our accounting and
reporting for derivatives in the following

Derivative
instruments and hedging activities

section.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities

We report all derivatives at fair value on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet in

derivative assets

and

derivative
liabilities

as both current and noncurrent. We determine the
current and noncurrent classification based on the timing of
expected future cash flows of individual contracts.

We utilize derivatives to manage our commodity price risk.
Derivative instruments held by us to manage commodity price risk
consist primarily of futures contracts, swap agreements, option
contracts, and forward contracts involving short- and long-term
purchases and sales of a physical energy commodity. We execute
most of these transactions in exchange-traded or

over-the

-counter
markets for which quoted prices in active periods exist. For
contracts with terms that exceed the time period for which
actively quoted prices are available, we must estimate commodity
prices during the illiquid periods when determining fair value.
We estimate commodity prices during illiquid periods utilizing
internally developed valuations incorporating information
obtained from commodity prices in actively quoted markets,
quoted prices in less active markets, prices reflected in
current transactions, and other market fundamental analysis.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

For commodity derivatives that are not designated in a hedging
relationship, we report changes in fair value currently in

revenues

. The accounting for changes in the fair value of
commodity derivatives designated in a hedging relationship
depends on the type of hedging relationship. We have elected the
normal purchases and normal sales exception, available under
SFAS No. 133, for certain commodity derivative
contracts held by Power involving short-and long-term purchases
and sales of a physical energy commodity. We reflect these
contracts in

derivative assets

and

derivative
liabilities

, as both current and noncurrent, at their fair
value on the date of the election less the amount of that fair
value realized during settlement periods subsequent to the
election. We elected the normal purchases and normal sales
exception on other commodity derivative contracts at their
inception. We do not reflect these contracts on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

In September 2004, we announced our decision to continue
operating the Power business and cease efforts to exit that
business. As a result of that decision, Power’s derivative
contracts became eligible for hedge accounting under
SFAS No. 133. Power elected cash flow hedge accounting
on a prospective basis beginning October 1, 2004, for
certain qualifying derivative contracts.

For a derivative to qualify for designation in a hedging
relationship, it has to meet specific criteria and we must
maintain appropriate documentation. We establish hedging
relationships pursuant to our risk management policies. We
evaluate the hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the hedging
relationship remains, and is expected to remain, highly
effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash
flows attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. If a
derivative ceases to be or is no longer expected to be highly
effective, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively, and
future changes in the fair value of the derivative are
recognized currently in

revenues

.

For commodity derivatives designated as a hedge of a forecasted
transaction (cash flow hedges), the effective portion of the
change in fair value of the derivative is reported in

other
comprehensive income (loss)

and reclassified into earnings
in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Any
ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair
value is recognized currently in

revenues

. Gains or
losses deferred in

accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)

associated with terminated derivatives, derivatives
that cease to be highly effective hedges, and cash flow hedges
that have been otherwise discontinued remain in

accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss)

until the hedged item
affects earnings or it is probable that the hedged item will not
occur by the end of the originally specified time period or
within two months thereafter. Forecasted transactions designated
as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge are regularly evaluated
to assess whether they continue to be probable of occurring. If
it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not
occur, any gain or loss deferred in

accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)

is recognized in

revenues

at that time.

Certain gains and losses on derivative instruments included in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations are netted together to
a single net gain or loss, while other gains and losses are
reported on a gross basis. Gains and losses recorded on a net
basis include:

Realized gains and losses on derivatives that require physical
delivery, and which are not held for trading purposes nor were
entered into as a pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement are
recorded on a gross basis. Our presentation of gains and losses

“Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative

•

EITF Issue No. 99-19 “Reporting Revenue Gross as a

The EITF concluded in Issue

that
judgment is required in determining whether realized gains and
losses on physically settled derivatives not held for trading
purposes should be reported on a gross or net basis. In reaching
our conclusions on presentation, we evaluated the indicators in
Issue No. 99-19, including whether we act as principal in
the transaction; whether we have the risks and rewards of
ownership, including credit risk; and whether we have latitude
in establishing prices.

Assessment of energy-related contracts for lease
    classification

EITF

01-8,

“Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease,”
became effective on July 1, 2003, and provides guidance for
determining whether certain contracts such as transportation,
transmission, storage, full requirements, and tolling agreements
are executory service arrangements or leases pursuant to
SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” The
consensus is applied prospectively to arrangements consummated
or modified after July 1, 2003. Prior to July 1, 2003,
we accounted for energy-related contracts as executory service
arrangements and continue this accounting unless a contract is
subsequently modified and evaluated to be a lease. For executory
service arrangements, the monthly demand payments are expensed
as incurred. Certain of Power’s tolling agreements will
likely be considered leases under the consensus if the tolling
agreements are ever modified. One tolling agreement was modified
in 2004 and is accounted for as an operating lease. For tolling
agreements that are modified and deemed to be operating leases,
the monthly demand payments are expensed as incurred. If the
monthly demand payments are not incurred on a straight-line
basis, expense is nevertheless recognized on a straight-line
basis. If such tolling agreements are modified and deemed to be
capital leases, the net present value of the demand payments
would be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as

long-term debt

and as an asset in

property, plant and
equipment — net

.

Gas Pipeline revenues

Revenues for sales of products are recognized in the period of
delivery, and revenues from the transportation of gas are
recognized in the period the service is provided. Gas Pipeline
is subject to FERC regulations and, accordingly, certain
revenues collected may be subject to possible refunds upon final
orders in pending rate cases. Gas Pipeline records estimates of
rate refund liabilities considering Gas Pipeline and other
third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and
estimated total exposure, as discounted and risk weighted, as
well as collection and other risks.

Exploration & Production revenues

Revenues from the domestic production of natural gas in
properties for which Exploration & Production has an
interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual
volumes sold during the period. Any differences between volumes
sold and entitlement volumes, based on Exploration &
Production’s net working interest, that are determined to
be nonrecoverable through remaining production are recognized as
accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate.
Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement
volumes are not significant.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Revenues, other than Gas Pipeline, Exploration &
    Production, and energy commodity risk management and trading
    activities

Revenues generally are recorded when services are performed or
products have been delivered.

Impairment of long-lived assets and investments

We evaluate the long-lived assets of identifiable business
activities for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate, in our management’s judgment, that
the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When
an indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our
management’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets
to determine whether an impairment has occurred. We apply a
probability-weighted approach to consider the likelihood of
different cash flow assumptions and possible outcomes including
selling in the near term or holding for the remaining estimated
useful life. If an impairment of the carrying value has
occurred, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized
in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the
assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying
value exceeds the estimated fair value.

For assets identified to be disposed of in the future and
considered held for sale in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we compare the carrying
value to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to
determine if recognition of an impairment is required. Until the
assets are disposed of, the estimated fair value, which includes
estimated cash flows from operations until the assumed date of
sale, is recalculated when related events or circumstances
change.

We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate, in our management’s
judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have
experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When
evidence of loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate
of fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the
investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. If
the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and we
consider the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the
excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized
in the consolidated financial statements as an impairment.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows and an asset’s
fair value. Additionally, judgment is used to determine the
probability of sale with respect to assets considered for
disposal. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions
could result in the recognition of different levels of
impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements.

Capitalization of interest

We capitalize interest on major projects during construction.
Interest is capitalized on borrowed funds and, where regulation
by the FERC exists, on internally generated funds. The rates
used by regulated companies are calculated in accordance with
FERC rules. Rates used by unregulated companies are based on the
average interest rate on debt. The benefit of interest
capitalized on internally generated funds for regulated entities
is reported in

other income (expense) — net

below

operating income

.

Additionally, Exploration & Production capitalizes
interest on those construction projects with construction
periods of at least three months and a total project cost in
excess of $1 million. Exploration & Production
capitalizes interest on equity investments when the investee is
undergoing construction in preparation for its planned principal
operations.

Employee stock-based awards

Employee stock-based awards are accounted for under Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations. Fixed-plan common stock



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

options generally do not result in compensation expense because
the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The plans are
described more fully in Note 13. The following table
illustrates the effect on

net income (loss)

and

earnings (loss) per share

if we had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(SFAS 123). Beginning January 1, 2006, we will adopt
revised SFAS No. 123, “Share-Based Payment”
(SFAS 123(R)). See further discussion in the

Recent
Accounting Standards

section within this note.

Pro forma amounts for 2005 include compensation expense from
awards of our company stock made in 2005, 2004, 2003, and 2002
(see Note 13). Pro forma amounts for 2004 include
compensation expense from awards made in 2004, 2003, 2002, and
2001. Also included in 2004 pro forma expense is
$3.3 million of incremental expense associated with the
stock option exchange program. Pro forma amounts for 2003
include compensation expense from awards made in 2003, 2002, and
2001. Also, included in 2003 pro forma expense is
$2 million of incremental expense associated with the stock
option exchange program.

Since compensation expense from stock options is recognized over
the future years’ vesting period for pro forma disclosure
purposes and additional awards are generally made each year, pro
forma amounts may not be representative of future years’
amounts.

Income taxes

We include the operations of our subsidiaries in our
consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are computed
using the liability method and are provided on all temporary
differences between the financial basis and the tax basis of our
assets and liabilities. Our management’s judgment and
income tax assumptions are used to determine the levels, if any,
of valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets.

Earnings (loss) per share

Basic earnings (loss) per share

is based on the sum of
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and
issuable restricted and vested deferred shares.

Diluted
earnings (loss) per share

includes any dilutive effect of
stock options, unvested deferred shares and, for applicable
periods presented, convertible preferred stock and convertible
debt, unless otherwise noted.

Foreign currency translation

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries and equity method investees
use their local currency as their functional currency. These
foreign currencies include the Canadian dollar, British pound
and Euro. Assets and liabilities of certain foreign subsidiaries
and equity investees are translated at the spot rate in effect
at the applicable reporting date, and the combined statements of
operations and our share of the results of operations of our
equity affiliates are translated into the U.S. dollar at
the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable
period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is
recorded as a separate component of

other comprehensive
income (loss).

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such
transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result
in transaction gains and losses which are reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Issuance of equity of consolidated subsidiary

Sales of equity by a consolidated subsidiary are accounted for
as capital transactions with the adjustment to capital in excess
of par value. No gain or loss is recognized on these
transactions.

Recent Accounting Standards

Stock-based awards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued SFAS 123(R). The Statement requires that
compensation costs for all share-based awards, including grants
of employee stock options, to employees be recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations based on their fair values.
Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The Statement,
as issued by the FASB, was to be effective as of the beginning
of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins
after June 15, 2005. However, in April 2005, the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a new rule that
delayed the effective date for SFAS 123(R) to the beginning
of the next fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. We
intend to adopt the revised Statement on January 1, 2006.

The Statement allows either a modified prospective application
or a modified retrospective application for adoption. We will
use a modified prospective application for adoption and will
apply the Statement to new awards and to awards modified,
repurchased, or cancelled after January 1, 2006. Also, for
unvested stock awards outstanding as of January 1, 2006,
compensation costs for the portion of these awards for which the
requisite service has not been rendered will be recognized as
the requisite service is rendered after January 1, 2006.
Compensation costs for these awards will be based on fair value
at the original grant date as estimated for the pro forma
disclosures under SFAS 123, as amended by
SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
an amendment of SFAS 123.” Additionally, a modified
retrospective application requires restating periods prior to
January 1, 2006 on a basis consistent with the pro forma
disclosures required by SFAS 123, as amended by
SFAS No. 148. Since we will use a modified prospective
application, we will not restate prior periods.

We currently account for share-based awards to employees by
applying the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB
No. 25 and, as such, generally recognize no compensation
cost for employee stock options. We currently recognize
compensation cost for deferred share awards. Adoption of the
Statement’s fair value method will have a significant
impact on our results of operations. At January 1, 2006, we
have approximately $56 million of compensation cost from
outstanding unvested stock awards to be recognized as the
requisite service is rendered, primarily in 2006 or 2007. Of the
$56 million of compensation cost, approximately
$23 million relates to stock options and approximately
$33 million relates to stock awards where we currently
recognize expense under APB No. 25 and related guidance.
Stock-based awards will be granted during 2006. Our compensation
cost as reported in pro forma disclosures required by
SFAS 123, as amended



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

by SFAS No. 148, may not be representative of
compensation cost to be incurred in 2006 and beyond as the
number and types of awards may differ and estimates of fair
value may differ due to changes in the market price of our
common stock, and to changing capital market and employee
exercise behavior assumptions.

Certain of our stock awards currently result in compensation
cost under APB No. 25 and related guidance. These stock
awards are subject to vesting provisions and our policy is to
adjust compensation cost for forfeitures when they occur. Upon
the January 1, 2006, adoption of SFAS 123(R), we will
reduce

net income (loss)

through

cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle

for previously recognized
compensation cost, net of income taxes, related to the estimated
number of these outstanding stock awards that are expected to be
forfeited. The adjustment will not be material.

We currently present pro forma disclosure of

net income
(loss)

and

earnings (loss) per share

as if
compensation costs from all stock awards were recognized based
on the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123. The
Statement requires use of valuation techniques, including option
pricing models, to estimate the fair value of employee stock
awards. For pro forma disclosures, we currently use a
Black-Scholes option pricing model in estimating the fair value
of employee stock options and we intend to continue using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model when we adopt
SFAS 123(R).

FERC Order, “Accounting for Pipeline Assessment
    Cost”

On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued an Order,
“Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Cost,” to be
effective January 1, 2006. The Order requires companies to
expense certain pipeline integrity-related assessment costs that
we have historically capitalized. We anticipate expensing
approximately $27 million to $35 million of costs
expected to be incurred in 2006 that would have been capitalized
prior to the Order becoming effective.

Other recent accounting standards

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4,” which will be applied prospectively for
inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Statement amends Accounting Research
Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory
Pricing,” to clarify that abnormal amounts of certain costs
should be recognized as current period charges and that the
allocation of overhead costs should be based on the normal
capacity of the production facility. The impact of this
Statement on our consolidated financial statements will not be
material.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29,” which is effective for nonmonetary
asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Statement amends APB Opinion
No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions.” The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29 is
based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged but includes certain exceptions to that principle.
SFAS No. 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29 to
eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
significantly as a result of the exchange. We will apply
SFAS No. 153 as required.

In March 2005, the FASB issued a Staff Position (FSP) on a
previously issued Interpretation (FIN). FSP
FIN

46(R)-5,

“Implicit Variable Interests under revised FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46(R)),

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,”

states that a reporting
enterprise must consider implicit variable interests when
applying the provisions of FIN 46(R). The FSP was effective
in the second quarter of 2005 and did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2005, the FASB staff issued FSP FAS 19-1,
“Accounting for Suspended Well Costs.” This FSP amends
SFAS No. 19, “Financial Accounting and Reporting
by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,” as it pertains to
capitalizing the costs of drilling exploratory wells pending
determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. FSP
FAS

19-1

provides
that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if
the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify
its completion as a producing well and the entity is making
sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operational viability of the project. This FSP was effective
beginning in the third quarter of 2005 and did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections — a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
No. 3,” which is effective prospectively for reporting
a change in accounting principle for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. The Statement changes the
reporting of a change in accounting principle to require
retrospective application to prior periods unless explicit
transition provisions provide otherwise. The Statement is
effective for any existing accounting pronouncements, including
those in the transition phase when it becomes effective. We will
apply SFAS No. 154 as required.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 04-10,
“Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That
Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds.” The consensus is
effective for fiscal years ending after September 15, 2005,
and does not affect the current presentation of our reportable
operating segments.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 05-2,
“The Meaning of Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument in
EITF Issue
No.

00-19,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to,
and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock.”

The consensus is to be applied prospectively
for new instruments entered into or existing instruments
modified in periods beginning after June 29, 2005. We have
outstanding 5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible
debentures that were considered conventional convertible debt at
issuance. This Issue does not currently impact these debentures.
If we were to modify these debentures, we would have to evaluate
the terms of the instruments after the modification to determine
if they would remain a conventional convertible debt instrument
or if the convertible features should be accounted for
separately as a derivative.

In September 2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue
No.

04-13,

“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the
Same Counterparty.” The consensus states that two or more
inventory purchase and sales transactions with the same
counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one
another should be combined as a single exchange transaction for
purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 29. A nonmonetary
exchange of inventory within the same line of business where
finished goods inventory is transferred in exchange for the
receipt of either raw materials or work in process inventory
should be recognized at fair value by the entity transferring
the finished goods inventory if fair value is determinable
within reasonable limits and the transaction has commercial
substance. All other nonmonetary exchanges of inventory within
the same line of business should be recognized at the carrying
amount of the inventory transferred. The Issue is effective for
new arrangements entered into, and modifications or renewals of
existing arrangements, beginning in the first reporting period
beginning after March 15, 2006. We will apply this Issue
beginning in the second quarter of 2006. We will assess the
impact of this Issue on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP
FAS

115-1

and
FAS

124-1,

“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments.” The FSP provides
guidance regarding when an investment is impaired, whether that
impairment is other than temporary and measurement of the
impairment loss. The FSP applies to debt and equity securities,
except equity securities accounted for under the equity method.
The FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the
application of this FSP to determine its potential impact to our
consolidated financial statements.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
“Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.” With
regard to SFAS No. 133, this Statement permits fair
value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that
contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require
bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only and principal-only
strips are not subject to the requirements of
SFAS No. 133, and requires the holder of an interest
in securitized financial assets to determine whether the
interest is a freestanding derivative or contains an embedded
derivative requiring bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 also
amends SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,” to eliminate a restriction on the passive
derivative financial instruments that a qualifying special
purpose entity may hold. SFAS No. 155 is effective for
all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning
of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
September 15, 2006. We will assess the impact of this
Statement on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Emerging accounting issues

In addition to the recently issued accounting standards, there
are several emerging accounting issues that could potentially
impact our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future,
including:

•

Proposed SFAS on “Fair Value Measurements” (exposure
    draft);

•

Proposed Interpretation on “Accounting for Uncertain Tax
    Positions — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109 (exposure draft);

•

Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
    (preliminary views).

We will monitor these emerging issues to assess any potential
future impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued Operations

The businesses discussed below represent components that have
been sold as of December 31, 2005, and also are classified
as discontinued operations. Therefore, their results of
operations (including any impairments, gains or losses),
financial position and cash flows have been reflected in the
consolidated financial statements and notes as discontinued
operations.

Summarized Results of Discontinued Operations

The following table presents the summarized results of
discontinued operations for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003.

Income (loss) from discontinued
operations before income taxes

for the year ended
December 31, 2004, includes charges of approximately
$153 million to increase our accrued liability associated
with certain Quality Bank litigation matters (see Note 15).
The

provision for income taxes

for the year ended
December 31, 2004, is less than the federal statutory rate
due primarily to the effect of net Canadian tax benefits
realized from the sale of the Canadian straddle plants partially
offset by the United States tax effect of earnings associated
with these assets.

2004 Completed Transactions

Canadian straddle plants

On July 28, 2004, we completed the sale of the Canadian
straddle plants for approximately $544 million and
recognized a $189.8 million pre-tax gain on the sale. These
assets were previously written down to estimated fair value,
resulting in impairments of $41.7 million during 2003 and
$36.8 million in 2002. In 2004, the fair value of the
assets increased substantially due primarily to renegotiation of
certain customer contracts and a general improvement in the
market for processing assets. These operations were part of the
Midstream segment.

Alaska refining, retail and pipeline operations

On March 31, 2004, we completed the sale of our Alaska
refinery, retail and pipeline operations for approximately
$304 million. We received $279 million in cash at the
time of sale and $25 million in cash during the second
quarter of 2004. Based on information we obtained throughout the
sales negotiations process, we recorded impairments of
$8 million in 2003 and $18.4 million in 2002. We
recognized a $3.6 million pre-tax gain on the sale during
first quarter 2004. These operations were part of the previously
reported Petroleum Services segment.

We are party to a pending matter involving pipeline
transportation rates charged to our former Alaska refinery in
prior periods. While we have no loss exposure in this matter,
favorable resolution could result in a refund.

2003 Completed Transactions

Canadian liquids operations

During the third quarter of 2003, we completed the sales of
certain gas processing, natural gas liquids fractionation, and
storage and distribution operations in western Canada and at our
Redwater, Alberta plant for total proceeds of $246 million.
We recognized pre-tax gains totaling $92.1 million in 2003
on the sales. These operations were part of our Midstream
segment.

Soda ash operations

On September 9, 2003, we completed the sale of our soda ash
mining facility located in Colorado. During 2003, we recognized
impairment charges of $17.4 million and a pre-tax loss on
the sale of $4.2 million. We had recorded impairment
charges of $133.5 million in 2002 and $170 million in
2001. The soda ash operations were part of the previously
reported International segment.

Williams Energy Partners

On June 17, 2003, we completed the sale of our
100 percent general partnership interest and
54.6 percent limited partner investment in Williams Energy
Partners for $512 million in cash and assumption by the
purchasers of $570 million in debt. In December 2003, we
received additional cash proceeds of $20 million following
the occurrence of a contingent event. We recognized a total
pre-tax gain of $310.8 million on the sale during 2003,
including the $20 million of additional proceeds. We
deferred an additional $113 million associated with certain
environmental indemnifications we provided the purchasers under
the sales agreement. In second quarter 2004, we settled these
indemnifications with an agreement to pay $117.5 million
over a four-year period (see Note 10). Williams Energy
Partners was a previously reported segment.

On May 30, 2003, we completed the sale of our bio-energy
operations for $59 million in cash. During 2003, we
recognized a pre-tax loss of $5.4 million on the sale. We
had recorded impairment charges totaling $195.7 million
during 2002. These operations were part of the previously
reported Petroleum Services segment.

Natural gas properties

On May 30, 2003, we completed the sale of natural gas
exploration and production properties in the Raton Basin in
southern Colorado and the Hugoton Embayment in southwestern
Kansas. This sale included all of our interests within these
basins. We recognized a $39.7 million pre-tax gain on the
sale during 2003. These properties were part of the
Exploration & Production segment.

Texas Gas

On May 16, 2003, we completed the sale of Texas Gas
Transmission Corporation for $795 million in cash and the
assumption by the purchaser of $250 million in existing
Texas Gas debt. We recorded a $109 million impairment
charge in 2003. No significant gain or loss was recognized on
the subsequent sale. These operations were part of the Gas
Pipeline segment.

Midsouth refinery

On March 4, 2003, we completed the sale of our refinery and
other related operations located in Memphis, Tennessee, for
$455 million in cash. We recognized a pre-tax gain on the
sale of $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2003. During
the second quarter of 2003, we recognized a $24.7 million
pre-tax gain on the sale of an earn-out agreement we retained in
the sale of the refinery. We had recorded impairment charges
totaling $240.8 million during 2002. These operations were
part of the previously reported Petroleum Services segment.

Williams travel centers

On February 27, 2003, we completed the sale of our travel
centers for approximately $189 million in cash. We did not
recognize a significant gain or loss on the sale. We had
recorded impairment charges of $146.6 million in 2002 and
$14.7 million in 2001. These operations were part of the
previously reported Petroleum Services segment.

Investments

Investments

at December 31, 2005 and 2004, are as
follows:

*

We own 20% directly and 40% indirectly through Williams Partners
    L.P., of which we own approximately 60%.

The difference between the carrying value of our equity
investments and the underlying equity in the net assets of the
investees is primarily related to the impairments recognized.

Dividends and distributions, including those discussed below,
received from companies accounted for by the equity method were
$447.4 million and $60 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Gulfstream

We received a $310.5 million distribution from Gulfstream
following its debt offering in October 2005. We also received
dividends of $60.5 million from Gulfstream in 2005. These
transactions reduced the carrying value of our investment.

Discovery

During 2005, our Midstream subsidiary acquired an additional
16.67 percent in Discovery, which was later reduced by
6.67 percent due to a nonaffiliated member exercising its
purchase option. After these transactions, we hold a
60 percent interest in Discovery. We continue to account
for this investment under the equity method due to the voting
provisions of Discovery’s limited liability company which
provide the other member of Discovery significant participatory
rights such that we do not control the investment.

Additionally, we contributed $40.7 million during 2005 to
Discovery for planned capital expenditures. Each owner
contributed an amount equal to their respective ownership
percentage, thus having no impact on the overall ownership
allocation. During 2005, we received $31.3 million in
distributions from Discovery, which reduced the carrying value
of our investment.

Longhorn

Shipping volumes on the Longhorn pipeline declined significantly
during the second quarter of 2005 compared to those experienced
in the first quarter. The decline was due primarily to the
impact of significant changes in transportation pricing
competition and economics in the wake of higher crude oil
prices. Longhorn management indicated that the shortfall in
volumes was likely to continue and that continued operation as
originally planned was no longer economically feasible. As a
result, the owners and management of Longhorn began evaluating
several alternatives for the future operation of Longhorn.

Based on management’s outlook for Longhorn at the end of
the second quarter, we assessed our investment in Longhorn to
determine if there had been an other-than-temporary decline in
its fair value. As a result, we recorded an impairment of
$49.1 million during the second quarter of 2005. In the
fourth quarter of 2005, management of Longhorn decided to pursue
a strategy of the sale of Longhorn. Based on initial indications
from potential buyers, we determined that our Longhorn
investment would require full impairment. Therefore, in fourth
quarter 2005, we recorded a $38.1 million impairment to
write off the remaining investment in Longhorn.

Aux Sable

During 2005, we decided to solicit sales offers for our
investment in Aux Sable, a natural gas liquids extraction and
fractionation facility. Based on initial indications of
potential sales proceeds, management concluded that there is an
other-than-temporary decline in fair value below carrying value.
Accordingly, we recorded an impairment of $23 million.

Impairment of goodwill

Because of our exit strategy during 2003 and the market
conditions in which this business operated, we evaluated
Power’s remaining goodwill for impairment. In estimating
the fair value of the Power segment, we considered our
derivative portfolio which is carried at fair value on the
balance sheet and our nonderivative portfolio which is no longer
carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Because of the
significant negative fair value of certain of our nonderivative
contracts, we determined we may be unable to realize the
carrying value of this segment; and thus, we recognized a
$45 million goodwill impairment during 2003.

Impairment of generation facilities

The 2003 impairment relates to the Hazelton generation facility.
Fair value was estimated using future cash flows based on
current market information and discounted at a risk adjusted
rate.

Midstream Gas & Liquids

Arbitration award on a Gulf Liquids insurance claim
    dispute

Winterthur International Insurance Company (Winterthur) issued
policies to Gulf Liquids providing financial assurance related
to construction contracts. After disputes arose regarding
obligations under the construction contracts, Winterthur
disputed coverage resulting in arbitration between Winterthur
and Gulf Liquids. In July 2004, the arbitration panel awarded
Gulf Liquids $93.6 million, plus interest of
$9.6 million. Following the arbitration decision,
Winterthur filed a Petition to Vacate the Final Award in the New
York State court and Gulf Liquids filed a Cross-Petition to
Confirm the Final Award. Prior to the State court’s ruling,
Winterthur agreed to the terms of the award and on
November 1, 2004, remitted the proceeds to us. As a result,
we recognized total income of approximately $103 million
related to the arbitration award in fourth quarter 2004.

Impairment of Gulf Liquids assets

During second quarter 2003, our Board of Directors approved a
plan to sell the assets of Gulf Liquids. In the third quarter of
2005, we sold substantially all of Gulf Liquids. We recognized
impairment charges of $2.5 million and $108.7 million
during 2004 and 2003, respectively, to reduce the carrying cost
of the long-lived assets to estimated fair value less costs to
sell the assets. We estimated fair value based on a
probability-weighted analysis of various scenarios including
expected sales prices, discounted cash flows and salvage
valuations. Prior to fourth quarter 2004, the operations of Gulf
Liquids were included in discontinued operations.

Other

Environmental accrual related to the Augusta refinery
    facility

As a result of information obtained in fourth quarter 2004
related to the Augusta refinery site, we accrued additional
amounts for completion of work under a current Administrative
Order on Consent and reasonably estimated remediation costs.
Accruals may be adjusted as more information from the site
investigation becomes available.

Reconciliations from the

provision (benefit) for income taxes

from continuing operations at the federal statutory rate to
the realized

provision (benefit) for income taxes

are as
follows:

Utilization of foreign operating loss carryovers reduced the
provision for income taxes by $13 million and
$19 million in 2005 and 2003, respectively. During 2004,
the utilization of foreign tax credits reduced the provision for
income taxes by $12 million.

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes
and cumulative effect of change in accounting principles

includes $59 million, $51 million, and $9 million
of international income in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

We provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method
as required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.” During 2005, as a result of additional analysis of
our tax basis and book basis assets and liabilities, we recorded
a $20.2 million tax benefit adjustment to reduce the
overall deferred income tax liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

Significant components of

deferred tax liabilities

and

deferred tax assets

as of December 31, 2005, and
2004, are as follows:

The

valuation allowance

at December 31, 2005, and
2004, serves to reduce the recognized tax benefit associated
with charitable contribution carryovers and foreign carryovers
to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized.

Undistributed earnings of certain consolidated foreign
subsidiaries at December 31, 2005, totaled approximately
$142 million. No provision for deferred U.S. income
taxes has been made for these subsidiaries because we intend to
permanently reinvest such earnings in foreign operations.

Cash payments for income taxes (net of refunds) were
$230 million and $8 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Of the $230 million for 2005,
$204 million relates to settlements with taxing authorities
associated with prior period audits. Cash refunds for income
taxes (net of payments) were $88 million in 2003.

At December 31, 2005, federal net operating loss carryovers
are $773 million and charitable contribution carryovers are
$44 million. We do not expect to utilize $24 million
of charitable contribution carryovers prior to expiration in
2006. We expect to utilize the net operating loss carryovers
prior to expiration in 2022 through 2025 and the remaining
$20 million of charitable contribution carryovers prior to
expiration in 2007 and 2008. We also do not expect to be able to
utilize $29 million of the $30.4 million available
foreign deferred tax assets related to carryovers.

During the course of audits of our business by domestic and
foreign tax authorities, we frequently face challenges regarding
the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions
regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation
of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the
liability associated with our various tax filing positions, we
record a liability for probable tax contingencies. In
association with this liability, we record an estimate of
related interest as a component of our current tax

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share from Continuing
    Operations

Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, are:

(1)

The year ended December 31, 2005, includes
    $10.2 million of interest expense, net of tax, associated
    with our convertible debentures (see Note 12). This amount
    has been added back to

income from continuing operations
    available to common stockholders

to calculate diluted
    earnings per common share (see discussion of antidilutive items
    below).

(2)

In February 2005 and October 2004, we issued 10.9 million
    and 33.1 million, respectively, common shares associated
    with our FELINE PACS units (see Note 12).

(3)

The unvested deferred shares outstanding at December 31,
    2005, will vest over the period from January 2006 to January
    2010.

Approximately 27.5 million and 16.5 million
weighted-average shares related to the assumed conversion of
convertible debentures, as well as the related interest, have
been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per
common share for the years ended December 31, 2004, and
2003, respectively. Inclusion of these shares would have an
antidilutive effect on diluted earnings per common share. If no
other components used to calculate diluted earnings per common
share change, we estimate the assumed conversion of convertible
debentures would have become dilutive and therefore be included
in diluted earnings per common share at an

income from
continuing operations available to common stockholders

amount of $198.1 million and $192.1 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, approximately

Employee Benefit Plans

We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in which
all eligible employees participate. Currently, eligible
employees earn benefits primarily based on a cash balance
formula. Various other formulas, as defined in the plan
documents, are utilized to calculate the retirement benefits for
plan participants not covered by the cash balance formula. At
the time of retirement, participants may receive annuity
payments, a lump sum payment or a combination of lump sum and
annuity payments. In addition to our pension plans, we currently
provide subsidized medical and life insurance benefits (other
postretirement benefits) to certain eligible participants.
Generally, employees hired after December 31, 1991, are not
eligible for these benefits, except for participants that were
employees of Transco Energy Company on December 31, 1995,
and other miscellaneous defined participant groups. Certain of
these other postretirement benefit plans, particularly the
subsidized medical benefit plans, provide for retiree
contributions and contain other cost-sharing features such as
deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance. The accounting for
these plans anticipates future cost-sharing that is consistent
with our expressed intent to increase the retiree contribution
level generally in line with health care cost increases.

The

regulatory asset

shown in the table above is the
portion of the additional minimum pension liability recognized
by our FERC-regulated gas pipelines. As required by FERC
accounting guidelines, our FERC-regulated gas pipelines are
required to record the effect of an additional minimum pension
liability to a

regulatory asset

instead of

accumulated
other comprehensive income.

The 2005

actuarial gain

of $2.5 million for our
pension plans included in the table of changes in benefit
obligation reflects a gain of approximately $68 million for
the cumulative impact of a correction of an error determined to
have occurred in 2003 and 2004. The error was associated with
our third-party actuarial computation of the benefit obligation
which resulted in the identification of errors in certain
Transco participant data involving annuity contract information
utilized for 2003 and 2004. This gain is offset substantially by
the impact of changes to the discount rates utilized to
determine the benefit obligation. The 2004

actuarial loss

of $116.3 million for our pension plans included in the
table of changes in benefit obligation reflects the impact of
changes in various actuarial assumptions used to calculate the
benefit obligation including the expected type of benefit
payment and discount rates. The 2005 actuarial loss of
$51.9 million for our other postretirement benefit plans
included in the table of changes in benefit obligation is due
primarily to the impact of changes in assumptions utilized to
calculate the benefit obligation including the health care cost
trend rates, discount rate and estimated cost savings related to
the Medicare Prescription Drug Act.

The current accounting rules for pension and other
postretirement benefit plans allow for the delayed recognition
of gains and losses caused by differences between actual and
assumed outcomes for items such as estimated return on plan
assets, or caused by changes in assumptions for items such as
discount rates or estimated future compensation levels. The

unrecognized net actuarial loss

presented in the previous
table represents the cumulative net deferred losses from these
types of differences or changes which have not yet been
recognized in the financial statements. A portion of the net
unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the
participants’ average remaining future years of service,
which is approximately 12 years for our pension plans and
14 years for our other postretirement benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was
$831.4 million and $823.4 million at December 31,
2005, and 2004, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets
for our pension plans with projected benefit obligation in
excess of plan assets were $428.6 million and
$359.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005,
and $381.2 million and $305.3 million, respectively,
at December 31, 2004. The accumulated benefit obligation
for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess
of plan assets was $16.7 million at December 31, 2005,
and $17.6 million at December 31, 2004. There were no
assets for these plans at December 31, 2005, and

Net periodic pension expense (income)

for 2005 includes a
$17.1 million reduction to expense to record the cumulative
impact of a correction of an error determined to have occurred
in 2003 and 2004. The error was associated with our third-party
actuarial computation of annual

net periodic pension expense

which resulted from the identification of errors in certain
Transco participant data involving annuity contract information
utilized for 2003 and 2004. The adjustment is reflected as
$16.1 million within

and $1 million within

The discount rates for our pension and other postretirement
benefit plans were determined separately based on an approach
specific to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash
flows. With the assistance of our third-party actuary, the plans
were analyzed and discount rates based on a yield curve
comprised of high-quality corporate bonds published by a large
securities firm were matched to a highly correlated published
index of high-quality corporate bonds. Based on an analysis
performed between each of the plans’ yield curve discount
rates and the index, a formula was developed to determine the
December 31, 2005, discount rates based upon the year-end
published index.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were
determined by combining a review of the historical returns
realized within the portfolio, the investment strategy included

Medicare Prescription Drug Act

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The
Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare
(Medicare Part D) beginning in 2006 as well as a federal
subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that
provide a

benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. Our health care plans for retirees include
prescription drug coverage. In accordance with FSP
No. FAS

106-1,

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003,” the provisions of the Act were not reflected in any
measures of benefit obligations or other postretirement benefit
expense in the financial statements or accompanying notes until
further guidance was effective. In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP
No. FAS

106-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003.” Although final guidance had not been issued, we
believed the prescription drug benefits included in our health
care plans for retirees, prior to the amendment of the plans
discussed below, were actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. In accordance with FSP
No. FAS

106-2,

we reflected the effect of the subsidy on the measurement of

net periodic other postretirement benefit expense (income)

in 2004.

Net periodic other postretirement benefit
expense (income)

for the year ended December 31, 2004,
reflects a reduction of $3.4 million, including a decrease
in

service cost

of $.4 million and decrease in

interest cost

of $2.7 million. The reduction in the
benefit obligation was approximately $43 million as of
January 1, 2004, and is included as a component of the

actuarial (gain) loss

in the table of changes in
benefit obligation. We amended our health care plans for
retirees in the fourth quarter of 2004 to coordinate and pay
secondary to any part of Medicare, including prescription drug
benefits covered by Medicare Part D. This amendment further
decreased the benefit obligation by $75.5 million and is
reflected as a

plan amendment

in the table of changes in
benefit obligation for 2004. As a result of the amendment, our
plans were no longer actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. Beginning in 2005, the net reduction to the
obligation is being amortized over approximately seven years
which is the participants’ average remaining years of
service to full eligibility for benefits. It is reflected in the

amortization of prior service credit

in the table of
components of

net periodic other postretirement benefit
expense (income

) for 2005.

Due to anticipated difficulties to administer our plans as
previously amended to coordinate and pay secondary to Medicare
Part D in 2006, we amended our plans in June 2005 to
generally provide primary prescription drug coverage and apply
for the federal subsidy in 2006. As a result of the amendment,
generally our plans are designed to be actuarially equivalent to
the standard coverage under Medicare Part D. The amendment
increased our benefit obligation by $51.2 million at
June 30, 2005, and is reflected as a

plan amendment

in the table of changes in benefit obligation for 2005.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, the increase to the
obligation is being amortized over the participants’
average remaining years of service to full eligibility for
benefits, which is approximately seven years.

Net periodic
other postretirement benefit expense

for 2005, reflects an
increase of $7.1 million, including an increase in

recognized net actuarial loss

of $.3 million, an
increase in

service cost

of $.3 million, an increase
in

interest cost

of $2.6 million, and an increase in

amortization of prior service credit

of
$3.9 million, resulting from the plan amendment. We are
continuing to evaluate coordination with Medicare Part D as
a strategy to decrease our benefit obligation in the future and
will closely monitor the development of systems and capabilities
of third-party administrators to coordinate prescription drug
benefits with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services.

Plan Assets

The investment policy for our pension and other postretirement
benefit plans articulates an investment philosophy in accordance
with ERISA which governs the investment of the assets in a
diversified portfolio. The investment strategy for the assets of
the pension plans and approximately one half of the assets of
the other postretirement benefit plans include maximizing
returns with reasonable and prudent levels of risk. The
investment returns on the approximate one half of remaining
assets of the other postretirement benefit plans is subject to
federal income tax, therefore the investment strategy also
includes investing in a tax efficient manner.

Included in equity securities are investments in commingled
funds that invest entirely in equity securities and comprise
37 percent of the pension plans weighted-average assets at
December 31, 2005, and 2004 and 26 percent and
24 percent of the other postretirement benefit plans’
weighted-average assets at December 31, 2005, and 2004,
respectively. Other assets are comprised primarily of cash and
cash equivalents for the pension plans and cash and cash
equivalents, and insurance contract assets for the other
postretirement benefit plans.

The assets are invested in accordance with the target
allocations identified in the previous table. The investment
policy provides for minimum and maximum ranges for the broad
asset classes in the previous table. Additional target
allocations are identified for specific classes of equity
securities. The asset allocation ranges established by the
investment policy are based upon a long-term investment
perspective. The ranges are more heavily weighted toward equity
securities since the liabilities of the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans are long-term in nature and
historically equity securities have significantly outperformed
other asset classes over long periods of time.

Equity security investments are restricted to high-quality,
readily marketable securities that are actively traded on the
major U.S. and foreign national exchanges. Investment in
Williams’ securities or an entity in which Williams has a
majority ownership is prohibited except where these securities
may be owned in a commingled investment vehicle in which the
pension plans trust invests. No more than five percent of the
total stock portfolio valued at market may be invested in the
common stock of any one corporation. The following securities
and transactions are not authorized: unregistered securities,
commodities or commodity contracts, short sales or margin
transactions or other leveraging strategies. Investment
strategies using options or futures are not authorized.

Debt security investments are restricted to high-quality,
marketable securities that include U.S. Treasury, federal
agencies and U.S. Government guaranteed obligations, and
investment grade corporate issues. The overall rating of the
debt security assets is required to be at least “A”,
according to the Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s
rating system. No more than five percent of the total portfolio
at the time of purchase may be invested in the debt securities
of any one issuer. U.S. Government guaranteed and agency
securities are exempt from this provision.

During 2005, 11 active investment managers and one passive
investment manager managed substantially all of the pension and
other postretirement benefit plans’ funds, each of whom had
responsibility for managing a specific portion of these assets.

Periodically, an asset and liability study is performed to
determine the optimal asset mix to meet future benefit
obligations. The most recent pension asset and liability study
was performed in 2001.

Plan Benefit Payments and Employer Contributions

The following are the expected benefits to be paid by the plan
and the expected federal prescription drug subsidy to be
received in the next ten years. These estimates are based on the
same assumptions previously

discussed and reflect future service as appropriate. The
actuarial assumptions are based on long-term expectations and
include, but are not limited to, assumptions as to average

Defined Contribution Plans

We also maintain defined contribution plans for the benefit of
substantially all of our employees. Generally, plan participants
may contribute a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax and
after-tax basis in accordance with the plan’s guidelines.
We match employees’ contributions up to certain limits.
Costs related to continuing operations of $17 million were
recognized for these plans in 2005 and 2004 and $18 million
was recognized for these plans in 2003. One of our defined
contribution plans was amended as of July 1, 2005, to
convert one of the funds within the plan to a nonleveraged
employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). The compensation cost
related to the ESOP of $.7 million is included in the
$17 million of contributions, previously mentioned above,
and represents the contribution made in consideration for
employee services rendered in 2005. It is measured by the amount
of cash contributed to the ESOP. The shares held by the ESOP are
treated as outstanding when computing earnings per share and the
dividends on the shares held by the ESOP are recorded as a
component of retained earnings. For 2006 and future years, there
will be no contributions to this ESOP, other than dividend
reinvestment, as contributions for purchase of our stock is now
restricted within this defined contribution plan.

Property, plant and equipment-net

includes approximately
$1.2 billion at December 31, 2005, and 2004, related
to amounts in excess of the original cost of the regulated
facilities within Gas Pipeline as a result of our prior
acquisitions. This amount is being amortized over 40 years
using the straight-line amortization method. Current FERC policy
does not permit recovery through rates for amounts in excess of
original cost of construction.

Asset retirement obligations

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” The
Interpretation clarifies that the term “conditional asset
retirement” as used in SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” refers
to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in
which the timing and/or method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the
control of the entity. The Interpretation also clarifies when an
entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate
the fair value of an asset retirement obligation.

We adopted the Interpretation on December 31, 2005. In
accordance with the Interpretation, we estimated future
retirement obligations for certain assets previously considered
to have an indeterminate life.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

As a result, we recorded an increase in

other liabilities and
deferred income

of $29.4 million, an increase in

property, plant and equipment — net

of
$12.2 million, and a

cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle of

$1.7 million (net of
$1.0 million of taxes). We also recorded a
$14.5 million regulatory asset in

other assets and
deferred charges

for retirement costs expected to be
recovered through regulated rates. Had we implemented the
Interpretation at the beginning of 2003, the financial statement
impact at December 31, 2004 would not be substantially
different than the impact at December 31, 2005.

We adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. As a
result, we recorded an increase in

other liabilities and
deferred

income of $33.4 million, an increase in

property, plant and equipment — net

of
$24.8 million, and a

cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle

credit of $1.2 million (net of
$0.1 million of taxes). We also recorded a
$9.7 million regulatory asset in

other assets and
deferred charges

for retirement costs expected to be
recovered through regulated rates.

The asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2005 and
2004 is $93 million and $55 million, respectively. The
increase in the obligation in 2005 is primarily due to
implementation of FIN 47, accretion, and revisions to
liability estimates.

The accrued obligations relate to producing wells, underground
storage caverns, offshore platforms, fractionation facilities,
gas gathering well connections and pipelines, and gas
transmission facilities. At the end of the useful life of each
respective asset, we are legally obligated to plug both
producing wells and storage caverns and remove any related
surface equipment, remove surface equipment and restore land at
fractionation facilities, to dismantle offshore platforms, to
cap certain gathering pipelines at the wellhead connection and
remove any related surface equipment, and to remove certain
components of gas transmission facilities from the ground.

Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities

Under our cash-management system, certain subsidiaries’
cash accounts reflect credit balances to the extent checks
written have not been presented for payment.

Accounts payable

includes approximately $69 million of these credit
balances at December 31, 2005, and $6 million at
December 31, 2004.

On May 26, 2004, we were released from certain historical
indemnities, primarily related to environmental remediation, for
an agreement to pay $117.5 million. We had previously
deferred $113 million of a gain on sale related to these
indemnities. At the date of sale, the deferred revenue and
identified obligations related to the indemnities totaled
$102 million. The carrying value of this obligation is
$51.3 million at December 31, 2005, and
$74.8 million at December 31, 2004. We will pay the
remaining balance in two installments of $20 million on
July 1, 2006, and $35 million on July 1, 2007.

We have provided guarantees in the event of nonpayment by our
previously owned communications subsidiary, WilTel, on certain
lease performance obligations that extend through 2042. The
maximum potential exposure is approximately $47 million at
December 31, 2005, and $49 million at

Revolving credit and letter of credit facilities

In January 2005, we replaced two unsecured bank revolving credit
facilities totaling $500 million with two new facilities
for the same amount, which have the same terms but almost all of
the restrictive covenants and events of default were removed or
made less restrictive. These facilities provide for both
borrowings and issuing letters of credit but are expected to be
used primarily for issuing letters of credit. In connection with
the replacement, we paid $19.1 million in fees that are
being amortized over the life of the new facilities. We are
required to pay to the bank fixed fees at a weighted-average
rate of 3.64 percent on the total committed amount of the
facilities. In addition, we pay interest on any borrowings at a
fluctuating rate comprised of either a base rate or LIBOR. We
were able to obtain the unsecured credit facilities because the
funding bank syndicated its associated credit risk through a
private offering that allows for the resale of certain
restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers. To
facilitate the syndication of these facilities, the bank
established trusts funded by the institutional investors. The
assets of the trusts serve as collateral to reimburse the bank
for our borrowings in the event that the facilities are
delivered to the investors as described below. Thus, we have no
asset securitization or collateral requirements under the
facilities. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events,
letters of credit under the agreement become cash collateralized
creating a borrowing under the facilities. Concurrently, the
funding bank can deliver the facilities to the institutional
investors, whereby the investors replace the funding bank as
lender under the facilities. Upon such occurrence, we will pay:

•

A fixed facility fee at a weighted-average rate of
    3.19 percent to the investors;

•

Interest on borrowings under the $400 million facility
    equal to a fixed rate of 3.57 percent;

•

Interest on borrowings under the $100 million facility at a
    fluctuating LIBOR interest rate.

At December 31, 2005, letters of credit totaling
$465 million have been issued under these facilities and no
revolving credit loans are outstanding.

During May 2005, we amended and restated our $1.275 billion
secured revolving credit facility, which is available for
borrowings and letters of credit, resulting in certain changes,
including the following:

The facility is guaranteed by Williams Gas Pipeline Company,
LLC. Northwest Pipeline and Transco each have access to
$400 million under the facility to the extent not otherwise
utilized by us. Interest is calculated based on a choice of two
methods: a fluctuating rate equal to the facilitating
bank’s base rate plus an applicable margin or a periodic
fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin. We are
required to pay a commitment fee (currently .325 percent
annually) based on the unused portion of the facility. The
applicable margins and commitment fee are based on the relevant
borrower’s senior unsecured long-term debt ratings.
Significant financial covenants under the credit agreement
include the following:

•

Ratio of debt to capitalization no greater than 70 percent
    for the period of December 31, 2004, through
    December 31, 2005, and 65 percent for the remaining
    term of the agreement. At December 31, 2005, we are in
    compliance with this covenant as our ratio of debt to
    capitalization, as calculated under this covenant, is
    approximately 57 percent.

•

Ratio of debt to capitalization, as calculated under this
    covenant, no greater than 55 percent for Northwest Pipeline
    and Transco.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

•

Ratio of EBITDA to interest, on a rolling four quarter basis, no
    less than (i) 1.5 for the period ending March 31,
    2005, (ii) 2.0 for any period after March 31, 2005
    through December 31, 2005, and (iii) 2.5 for the
    remaining term of the agreement. Through December 31, 2005,
    we are in compliance with this covenant as we exceed the
    compliance level by approximately 62 percent.

At December 31, 2005, letters of credit totaling
$378 million have been issued under this facility and no
revolving credit loans are outstanding.

In September 2005, we entered into two unsecured bank revolving
credit facilities totaling $700 million that are similar in
structure to our $500 million credit facilities. These
facilities provide for both borrowings and issuing letters of
credit, but are expected to be used primarily for issuing
letters of credit. We are required to pay fixed facility fees at
a weighted-average rate of 2.29 percent on the total
committed amount of the facilities. In addition, we will pay
interest on any borrowings at a fluctuating rate comprised of
either a base rate or LIBOR. Similar to our $500 million
facilities described above, we were able to obtain these
unsecured facilities because the funding bank syndicated its
associated credit risk into the institutional investor market
through a private offering. Upon the occurrence of certain
credit events, letters of credit under the agreement become cash
collateralized creating a borrowing under the facilities.
Concurrently, the funding bank can deliver the facilities to the
institutional investors, whereby the investors replace the
funding bank as lender under the facilities. Upon such
occurrence, we will pay:

•

A fixed facility fee as described above;

•

Interest on borrowings under the $500 million facility at a
    fixed rate of 4.35 percent;

•

Interest on borrowings under the $200 million facility at a
    floating LIBOR interest rate.

At December 31, 2005, letters of credit totaling
$671 million have been issued under these facilities and no
revolving credit loans are outstanding.

Retirements

During January 2005, we retired $200 million of

5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures due
2033. These notes, which are callable after seven years, are
convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at
a conversion price of approximately $10.89 per share. In
November 2005, we initiated an offer to convert these debentures
to shares of our common stock. In January 2006, we converted
approximately $220.2 million of the debentures (see

(see
Note 1). Under the tolling agreement, Power has the
exclusive right to capacity and fuel conversion services as well
as ancillary services associated with electric generation
facilities that are currently in operation in southern
California. Current annual rentals under this tolling agreement
are approximately $162 million with approximately
12 years remaining on the agreement as of December 31,
2005. These rentals are offset through year 2010 with income
from sales and other transactions made possible by the tolling
agreement.

Total rent expense was $226 million in 2005,
$206 million in 2004 and $110 million in 2003. Rent
expense at Power, primarily related to the tolling agreement,
was $161 million (including ($1) million of contingent
rentals) in 2005 and $136 million (including
$9 million of contingent rentals) in 2004. Contingent
rentals are primarily based on utilization of the leased
property or changes in the capacity and availability of the
power generating facility. Income from sales and other
transactions made possible by the tolling agreement was
approximately $172 million (including $7 million of
contingent rental income) in 2005 and $129 million
(including $6 million of contingent rental income) in 2004.

Stockholders’ Equity

On June 10, 2003, we redeemed all of the outstanding
9.875 percent

cumulative-convertible

preferred shares for approximately $289 million, plus
$5.3 million for accrued dividends. The $13.8 million
of payments in excess of carrying value of the shares was also
recorded as a dividend. These shares were repurchased with
proceeds from a private placement of $300 million of
5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures due
2033. These notes, which are callable after seven years, are
convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at
a conversion price of approximately $10.89 per share.

In November 2005, we initiated an offer to convert the
5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures into
our common stock. In January 2006, we converted approximately
$220.2 million of the debentures in exchange for
20.2 million shares of common stock, a $25.8 million
cash premium, and $1.5 million of accrued interest.

In January 2002, we issued $1.1 billion of 6.5 percent
notes payable in 2007 that were subject to remarketing in 2004.
Each note was bundled with an equity forward contract (together,
the FELINE PACS units) and sold in a public offering for
$25 per unit. The equity forward contract required the
holder of each note to purchase one share of our common stock
for $25 three years from issuance of the contract. In the fourth
quarter of 2004, we exchanged approximately 33.1 million of
the 44 million issued and outstanding FELINE PACS units for
one share of our common stock plus $1.47 in cash for each unit.

2005, the settlement date of the equity forward contracts, the
holders of the remaining 10.9 million equity forward
contracts purchased one share of our common stock for $25,
resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $273 million
and an increase in

capital in excess of par value

of
approximately $262 million.

We maintain a Stockholder Rights Plan, as amended and restated
on September 21, 2004, under which each outstanding share
of our common stock has a right (as defined in the plan)
attached. Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised
to purchase, at an exercise price of $50 (subject to
adjustment), one two-hundredth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The rights may be
exercised only if an Acquiring Person acquires (or obtains the
right to acquire) 15 percent or more of our common stock or
commences an offer for 15 percent or more of our common
stock. The rights, which until exercised do not have voting
rights, expire in 2014 and may be redeemed at a price of
$.01 per right prior to their expiration, or within a
specified period of time after the occurrence of certain events.
In the event a person becomes the owner of more than
15 percent of our common stock, each holder of a right
(except an Acquiring Person) shall have the right to receive,
upon exercise, our common stock having a value equal to two
times the exercise price of the right. In the event we are
engaged in a merger, business combination or 50 percent or
more of our assets, cash flow or earnings power is sold or
transferred, each holder of a right (except an Acquiring Person)
shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of
the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the
exercise price of the right.

Stock-Based Compensation

Plan Information

The Williams Companies, Inc. 2002 Incentive Plan (Plan) was
approved by stockholders on May 16, 2002, and amended and
restated on May 15, 2003, and January 23, 2004. The
Plan provides for common-stock-based awards to both employees
and nonmanagement directors. Upon approval by the stockholders,
all prior stock plans were terminated resulting in no further
grants being made from those plans. However, awards outstanding
in those prior plans remain in those plans with their respective
terms and provisions.

The Plan permits the granting of various types of awards
including, but not limited to, stock options, restricted stock
and deferred stock. Awards may be granted for no consideration
other than prior and future services or based on certain
financial performance targets being achieved. At
December 31, 2005, 45 million shares of our common
stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to existing and future
stock awards, of which 21.6 million shares were available
for future grants. At December 31, 2004, 49.7 million
shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance, of which
25.2 million were available.

Loans

Several of our prior stock plans allowed us to loan money to
participants to exercise stock options using stock certificates
as collateral. Effective November 14, 2001, we no longer
issue loans under the stock option loan programs. Loan holders
were offered a one-time opportunity in January 2002 to refinance
outstanding loans at a market rate of interest commensurate with
the borrower’s credit standing. At December 31, 2005,
$4.6 million of the notes remain outstanding. However,
$4.4 million of the outstanding notes were paid by the end
of February 2006. Loans outstanding at December 31, 2004,
totaled $22 million (net of a $7 million allowance).

Options

The purchase price per share for stock options may not be less
than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant. Stock options generally become exercisable over a
three-year period from the date of grant and generally expire
ten years after grant.

On May 15, 2003, our shareholders approved a stock option
exchange program. Under this program, eligible employees were
given a one-time opportunity to exchange certain outstanding
options for a proportionately lesser number of options at an
exercise price to be determined at the grant date of the new
options. Surrendered options were cancelled June 26, 2003,
and replacement options were granted on December 29, 2003.
We did not recognize any expense pursuant to the stock option
exchange. However, for purposes of pro forma disclosures, we
recognized additional expense related to these new options. The
remaining pro forma expense on the cancelled options was
amortized through year-end 2004.

Financial Instruments, Derivatives, Guarantees and
    Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial Instruments

Fair-value methods

We used the following methods and assumptions in estimating our
fair-value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash:

The
carrying amounts of cash equivalents reported in the balance
sheet approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of
these instruments.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Other securities, notes and other noncurrent receivables,
structured indemnity settlement obligation, margin deposits, and
customer margin deposits payable:

The carrying amounts
reported in the balance sheet approximate fair value as these
instruments have interest rates approximating market

. Other
securities

consists primarily of auction rate securities.

Long-term debt:

The fair value of our publicly traded
long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond
market prices. Private debt is valued based on the prices of
similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. At
both December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately
89 percent of our long-term debt was publicly traded. We
use the expertise of outside investment banking firms to assist
with the estimate of the fair value of our long-term debt.

Energy derivatives:

Energy derivatives include:

The fair value of energy derivatives is determined based on the
nature of the underlying transaction and the market in which the
transaction is executed. Most of these transactions are executed
in exchange-traded or over-the-counter markets for which quoted
prices in active periods exist. For contracts with lives
exceeding the time period for which quoted prices are available,
we determined fair value by estimating commodity prices during
the illiquid periods. We estimated commodity prices during
illiquid periods by incorporating information obtained from
commodity prices in actively quoted markets, prices reflected in
current transactions and market fundamental analysis.

Carrying amounts and fair values of our financial
    instruments



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Energy Derivatives

Our energy derivative contracts include the following:

Futures contracts:

Futures contracts are commitments to
either purchase or sell a commodity at a future date for a
specified price and are generally settled in cash, but may be
settled through delivery of the underlying commodity.
Exchange-traded or over-the-counter markets providing quoted
prices in active periods are available. Where quoted prices are
not available, other market indicators exist for the futures
contracts we enter into. The fair value of these contracts is
based on quoted prices.

Swap agreements and forward purchase and sale contracts:

Swap agreements require us to make payments to (or receive
payments from) counterparties based upon the differential
between a fixed and variable price or variable prices of energy
commodities for different locations. Forward contracts, which
involve physical delivery of energy commodities, contain both
fixed and variable pricing terms. Swap agreements and forward
contracts are valued based on prices of the underlying energy
commodities over the contract life and contractual or notional
volumes with the resulting expected future cash flows discounted
to a present value using a risk-free market interest rate.

Options:

Physical and financial option contracts give the
buyer the right to exercise the option and receive the
difference between a predetermined strike price and a market
price at the date of exercise. These contracts are valued based
on option pricing models considering prices of the underlying
energy commodities over the contract life, volatility of the
commodity prices, contractual volumes, estimated volumes under
option and other arrangements and a risk-free market interest
rate.

Energy commodity cash flow hedges

We are exposed to market risk from changes in energy commodity
prices within our operations. We utilize derivatives to manage
our exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows
attributable to commodity price risk associated with forecasted
purchases and sales of natural gas and electricity. Certain of
these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.

Our Power segment sells electricity produced by our electric
generation facilities, obtained contractually through tolling
agreements or obtained through marketplace transactions at
different locations throughout the United States. We also buy
electricity and capacity to serve our full requirements
agreements in the Southeast. To reduce exposure to a decrease in
revenues and increase in costs from fluctuations in electricity
prices, we enter into fixed-price forward physical sales and
purchase contracts to fix the price of forecasted electricity
sales and purchases, respectively.

Our electric generation facilities and tolling agreements
require natural gas for the production of electricity. To reduce
the exposure to increasing costs of natural gas due to changes
in market prices, we enter into natural gas futures contracts,
swap agreements and fixed-price forward physical purchases to
fix the prices of anticipated purchases of natural gas.

Power’s cash flow hedges are expected to be highly
effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the
hedged risk during the term of the hedge. However,
ineffectiveness may be recognized primarily as a result of
locational differences between the hedging derivative and the
hedged item, changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties
and the hedging derivative contract having an initial fair value
upon designation.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Our Exploration & Production segment produces, buys and
sells natural gas at different locations throughout the United
States. To reduce exposure to a decrease in revenues from
fluctuations in natural gas market prices, we hedge price risk
by entering into natural gas futures contracts, swap agreements,
and financial option contracts to fix the price of forecasted
sales and purchases of natural gas. We also enter into basis
swap agreements as part of our overall natural gas price risk
management program to reduce the locational price risk
associated with our producing basins. Exploration &
Production’s cash flow hedges are expected to be highly
effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the
hedged risk during the term of the hedge. However,
ineffectiveness may be recognized primarily as a result of
locational differences between the hedging derivative and the
hedged item.

Changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges are deferred
in other comprehensive income and are reclassified into revenues
in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted
purchases or sales affect earnings, or when it is probable that
the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur either by the
end of the originally specified time period or within an
additional two-month period. Approximately $2 million and
$13 million of net gains from hedge ineffectiveness is
included in revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
during 2005 and 2004, respectively. For 2005 and 2004, there
were no derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment
of hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2005, we had
hedged portions of future cash flows associated with anticipated
energy commodity purchases and sales for up to 10 years.
Based on recorded values at December 31, 2005,
approximately $280 million of net losses (net of income tax
benefits of $173 million) will be reclassified into
earnings within the next year. These recorded values are based
on market prices of the commodities as of December 31,
2005. Due to the volatile nature of commodity prices and changes
in the creditworthiness of counterparties, actual gains or
losses realized in 2006 will likely differ from these values.
These gains or losses will offset net losses or gains that will
be realized in earnings from previous unfavorable or favorable
market movements associated with underlying hedged transactions.

Power elected hedge accounting for certain of its nontrading
derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2004 after our Board
decided in September 2004 to retain Power and cease efforts to
exit that business. Before this election, net changes in the
fair value of these derivatives were recognized as revenues in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Other energy derivatives

Our Power segment has other energy derivatives that have not
been designated or do not qualify as SFAS No. 133
hedges. As such, the net change in their fair value is
recognized in revenues in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Even though they do not qualify for hedge accounting
(see derivative instruments and hedging activities in
Note 1 for a description of hedge accounting), certain of
these derivatives hedge Power’s future cash flows on an
economic basis. In addition, our Exploration &
Production segment enters into natural gas basis swap agreements
that are not designated in a hedging relationship under
SFAS No. 133.

We also hold significant nonderivative energy-related contracts
in our Power portfolios. These have not been included in the
financial instruments table above because they are not
derivatives as defined by SFAS No. 133. See Note 1
regarding

energy commodity risk management and trading
activities

for further discussion of the nonderivative
energy-related contracts.

Guarantees

In addition to the guarantees and payment obligations discussed
elsewhere in these footnotes (see Notes 3, 10, and 15), we
have issued guarantees and other similar arrangements with
off-balance sheet risk as discussed below.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

In connection with agreements executed prior to our acquisition
of Transco to resolve take-or-pay and other contract claims and
to amend gas purchase contracts, Transco entered into certain
settlements with producers which may require the indemnification
of certain claims for additional royalties that the producers
may be required to pay as a result of such settlements. Transco,
through its agent, Power, continues to purchase gas under
contracts which extend, in some cases, through the life of the
associated gas reserves. Certain of these contracts contain
royalty indemnification provisions that have no carrying value.
Producers have received certain demands and may receive other
demands, which could result in claims pursuant to royalty
indemnification provisions. Indemnification for royalties will
depend on, among other things, the specific lease provisions
between the producer and the lessor and the terms of the
agreement between the producer and Transco. Consequently, the
potential maximum future payments under such indemnification
provisions cannot be determined. However, management believes
that the probability of payments is remote.

In connection with the 1993 public offering of units in the
Williams Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust (Royalty Trust), our
Exploration & Production segment entered into a gas
purchase contract for the purchase of natural gas in which the
Royalty Trust holds a net profits interest. Under this
agreement, we guarantee a minimum purchase price that the
Royalty Trust will realize in the calculation of its net profits
interest. We have an annual option to discontinue this minimum
purchase price guarantee and pay solely based on an index price.
The maximum potential future exposure associated with this
guarantee is not determinable because it is dependent upon
natural gas prices and production volumes. No amounts have been
accrued for this contingent obligation as the index price
continues to substantially exceed the minimum purchase price.

A foreign bank is a defendant in litigation related to a loan
they provided to us. We have repaid the loan and indemnified the
bank for legal fees and potential losses that may result from
this litigation. We are unable to determine the maximum amount
of future payments that we could be required to pay as it is
dependent upon the ultimate resolution of the claim. However, we
believe the probability is remote that a judgment will be made
against the bank that we will have to pay. The carrying value of
this guarantee is $0.1 million at December 31, 2005.

We are required by certain foreign lenders to ensure that the
interest rates received by them under various loan agreements
are not reduced by taxes by providing for the reimbursement of
any domestic taxes required to be paid by the foreign lender.
The maximum potential amount of future payments under these
indemnifications is based on the related borrowings. These
indemnifications generally continue indefinitely unless limited
by the underlying tax regulations and have no carrying value. We
have never been called upon to perform under these
indemnifications.

Former managing directors of Gulf Liquids are involved in
litigation related to the construction of the gas processing
plants. Gulf Liquids has indemnity obligations to the former
directors for legal fees and potential losses that may result
from this litigation. We are unable to determine the maximum
amount of future payments that we could be required to pay as it
is dependent upon the ultimate resolution of the litigation.
However, we believe the probability is remote that a judgment
will be entered against the former directors that we will have
to pay. Thus, no amounts have been accrued for this contingent
obligation. These legal fees and any judgment should be
recoverable under a directors and officers insurance policy.

We have guaranteed the performance of a former subsidiary of our
wholly owned subsidiary MAPCO Inc., under a coal supply
contract. This guarantee was granted by MAPCO Inc. upon the sale
of its former subsidiary to a third-party in 1996. The
guaranteed contract provides for an annual supply of a minimum
of 2.25 million tons of coal. Our potential exposure is
dependent on the difference between current market prices of
coal and the pricing terms of the contract, both of which are
variable, and the remaining term of the contract. Given the
variability of the terms, the maximum future potential payments
cannot be determined. We believe that our likelihood of
performance under this guarantee is remote. In the event we are
required to perform, we are fully indemnified by the purchaser
of MAPCO Inc.’s former subsidiary. This guarantee expires
in December 2010 and has no carrying value.

Gulf Coast, Venezuela and Canada. Customers for power include
the California Independent System Operator (ISO), the California
Department of Water Resources, and other power marketers and
utilities located throughout the majority of the United States.
Other receivables in 2004 included a $54.1 million
receivable from WilTel. We sold this receivable in January 2005,
for $54.6 million. As a general policy, collateral is not
required for receivables, but customers’ financial
condition and credit worthiness are evaluated regularly.

As of December 31, 2005, Power had approximately
$33 million of certain power receivables net of related
allowances from the ISO and the California Power Exchange
(compared to $61 million at December 31, 2004). We
believe that we have appropriately reflected the collection and
credit risk associated with receivables and derivative assets in
our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations at
December 31, 2005.

Derivative assets and liabilities

We have a risk of loss as a result of counterparties not
performing pursuant to the terms of their contractual
obligations. Risk of loss can result from credit considerations
and the regulatory environment of the counterparty. We attempt
to minimize credit-risk exposure to derivative counterparties
and brokers through formal credit policies, consideration of
credit ratings from public ratings agencies, monitoring
procedures, master netting agreements and collateral support
under certain circumstances.

The concentration of counterparties within the energy and energy
trading industry impacts our overall exposure to credit risk in
that these counterparties are similarly influenced by changes in
the economy and regulatory issues. Additional collateral support
could include the following:

•

Letters of credit;

•

Payment under margin agreements;

•

Guarantees of payment by credit worthy parties;

Issues Resulting From California Energy Crisis

Subsidiaries of our Power segment are engaged in power marketing
in various geographic areas, including California. Prices
charged for power by us and other traders and generators in
California and other western states in 2000 and 2001 were
challenged in various proceedings, including those before the
FERC. These challenges included refund proceedings, summer 2002

90-day

contracts,
investigations of alleged market manipulation including
withholding, gas indices and other gaming of the market, new
long-term power sales to the State of California that were
subsequently challenged and civil litigation relating to certain
of these issues. We have entered into settlements with the State
of California (State Settlement), major California utilities
(Utilities Settlement), and others that substantially resolved
each of these issues with these parties. Certain issues,
however, remain open at the FERC and for other nonsettling
parties.

Refund proceedings

Although we entered into the State Settlement and Utilities
Settlement, which resolved the refund issues among the settling
parties, we continue to have potential refund exposure to
nonsettling parties, such as various California end users that
did not participate in the Utilities Settlement. As a part of
the Utilities Settlement, we funded escrow accounts that we
anticipate will satisfy any ultimate refund determinations in
favor of the nonsettling parties. We are also owed interest from
counterparties in the California market during the refund period
for which we have recorded a receivable totaling approximately
$27 million at December 31, 2005. Collection of the
interest is subject to the conclusion of this proceeding.
Therefore, we continue to participate in the FERC refund case
and related proceedings. Challenges to virtually every aspect of
the refund proceeding, including the refund period, are now
pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. As part of
the State Settlement, an additional $60 million, previously
accrued, remains to be paid to the California Attorney General
(or his designee) over the next five years, with the final
payment of $15 million due on January 1, 2010.

Reporting of Natural Gas-Related Information to Trade
    Publications

We disclosed on October 25, 2002, that certain of our
natural gas traders had reported inaccurate information to a
trade publication that published gas price indices. In 2002, we
received a subpoena from a federal grand jury in northern
California seeking documents related to our involvement in
California markets, including our reporting to trade
publications for both gas and power transactions. We have
completed our response to the subpoena. Two former traders with
Power have pled guilty to manipulation of gas prices through
misreporting to an industry trade periodical. On
February 21, 2006, we entered into a deferred prosecution
agreement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) that is
intended to resolve this matter. Pursuant to the agreement, we
will pay $50 million. Absent a breach, the agreement will
expire in 15 months and no further action will be taken by
the DOJ.

Civil suits based on allegations of manipulating the gas indices
have been brought against us and others, in each case seeking an
unspecified amount of damages. We are currently a defendant in:

•

Federal court in New York based on an allegation of manipulation
    of the NYMEX gas market. We have reached a settlement of this
    matter for $9.15 million. The settlement agreement has been
    filed with the court and is subject to court approval.

•

Class action litigation in federal court in Nevada alleging that
    we manipulated gas prices for direct purchasers of gas in
    California. We have reached settlement of this matter for
    $2.4 million. Legal documents will be filed with the court
    and the settlement is subject to court approval.

•

Class action litigation in state court in California alleging
    that we manipulated prices for indirect purchasers of gas in
    California. We have reached settlement of this matter for
    $15.6 million. Legal documents will be filed with the court
    and the settlement is subject to court approval.

•

State court in California on behalf of certain individual gas
    users.

•

Class action litigation in state court in Kansas and Tennessee
    brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of gas in those states.

It is reasonably possible that additional amounts may be
necessary to resolve the remaining outstanding litigation in
this area.

Mobile Bay Expansion

In December 2002, an administrative law judge at the FERC issued
an initial decision in Transco’s general rate case which,
among other things, rejected the recovery of the costs of
Transco’s Mobile Bay expansion project from its shippers on
a “rolled-in” basis and found that incremental pricing
for the Mobile Bay expansion project is just and reasonable. In
March 2004, the FERC issued an Order on Initial Decision in
which it reversed certain parts of the administrative law
judge’s decision and accepted Transco’s proposal for
rolled-in rates. Power holds long-term transportation capacity
on the Mobile Bay expansion project. If the FERC had adopted the
decision of the administrative law judge on the pricing of the
Mobile Bay expansion project and also required that the decision
be implemented effective September 1, 2001, Power could
have been subject to surcharges of approximately
$77.1 million, excluding interest, through
December 31, 2005, in addition to increased costs going
forward. Certain parties have filed appeals in federal court
seeking to have the FERC’s ruling on the rolled-in rates
overturned.

Enron Bankruptcy

We have outstanding claims against Enron Corp. and various of
its subsidiaries (collectively “Enron”) related to its
bankruptcy filed in December 2001. In 2002, we sold
$100 million of our claims against Enron to a third party
for $24.5 million. In 2003, Enron filed objections to these
claims. We have resolved Enron’s objections, subject to
court approval. Under the sales agreement, the purchaser of the
claims may demand repayment of the purchase price for the
reduced portions of the claims. We anticipate negotiating with
the purchaser regarding potential payment obligations.

Environmental Matters

Continuing operations

Since 1989, our Transco subsidiary has had studies underway to
test certain of its facilities for the presence of toxic and
hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if any,
remediation may be necessary. Transco has responded to data
requests from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and state agencies regarding such potential
contamination of certain of its sites. Transco has identified
polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in compressor
systems, soils and related properties at certain compressor
station sites. Transco has also been involved in negotiations
with the EPA and state agencies to develop screening, sampling
and cleanup programs. In addition, Transco commenced
negotiations with certain environmental authorities and other
programs concerning investigative and remedial actions relative
to potential mercury contamination at certain gas metering
sites. The costs of any such remediation will depend upon the
scope of the remediation. At December 31, 2005, Transco had
accrued liabilities of $14 million related to PCB
contamination, potential mercury contamination, and other toxic
and hazardous substances. Transco has been identified as a
potentially responsible party at various Superfund and state
waste disposal sites. Based on present volumetric estimates and
other factors, Transco has estimated its aggregate exposure for
remediation of these sites to be less than $500,000, which is
included in the environmental accrual discussed above.

Beginning in the mid-1980’s, our Northwest Pipeline
subsidiary evaluated many of its facilities for the presence of
toxic and hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if
any, remediation might be



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

necessary. Consistent with other natural gas transmission
companies, Northwest Pipeline identified PCB contamination in
air compressor systems, soils and related properties at certain
compressor station sites. Similarly, Northwest Pipeline
identified hydrocarbon impacts at these facilities due to the
former use of earthen pits and mercury contamination at certain
gas metering sites. The PCBs were remediated pursuant to a
Consent Decree with the EPA in the late 1980s and Northwest
Pipeline conducted a voluntary

clean-up

of the
hydrocarbon and mercury impacts in the early 1990s. In 2005, the
Washington Department of Ecology required Northwest Pipeline to
reevaluate its previous mercury clean-ups in Washington.
Currently, Northwest Pipeline is assessing the actions needed to
bring the sites up to Washington’s current environmental
standards. At December 31, 2005, we have accrued
liabilities totaling approximately $4 million for these
costs. We expect that these costs will be recoverable through
Northwest Pipeline’s rates.

We also accrue environmental remediation costs for our natural
gas gathering and processing facilities, primarily related to
soil and groundwater contamination. At December 31, 2005,
we have accrued liabilities totaling approximately
$7 million for these costs.

In August 2005, our subsidiary, Williams Production RMT Company,
voluntarily disclosed to the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment (CDPHE) two air permit violations related
to malfunctioning equipment. In October 2005, the CDPHE
responded to our disclosure indicating that penalty immunity is
not available in the matter and that it will seek resolution
through a Compliance Order on Consent. We believe that our
voluntary self-evaluation and disclosure qualified for penalty
immunity and will discuss resolution of the compliance issues
with the CDPHE.

Former operations, including operations classified as
    discontinued

In connection with the sale of certain assets and businesses, we
have retained responsibility, through indemnification of the
purchasers, for environmental and other liabilities existing at
the time the sale was consummated, as described below.

Agrico

In connection with the 1987 sale of the assets of Agrico
Chemical Company, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for
environmental cleanup costs resulting from certain conditions at
specified locations to the extent such costs exceed a specified
amount. At December 31, 2005, we have accrued liabilities
of approximately $11 million for such excess costs.

We are in a dispute with a defendant that was involved in two
class action damages lawsuits in Florida state court involving
this former chemical fertilizer business. Settlement of both
class actions was judicially approved in October 2004. We were
not a named defendant in the settled lawsuits, but have
contractual obligations to participate with the named defendants
in the ongoing environmental remediation. One defendant seeks
indemnification of approximately $20 million from us as a
result of the settlement. In November 2005, the court ordered us
to arbitrate the indemnification dispute with the one defendant.
The arbitration is expected to occur in the second quarter of
2006. Under the arbitration format, the arbitrator must choose
without any modification either our $1 million final offer
or the defendant’s approximately $20 million final
offer.

Other

At December 31, 2005, we have accrued environmental
liabilities totaling approximately $28 million related
primarily to our:

•

Potential indemnification obligations to purchasers of our
    former retail petroleum and refining operations;



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

•

Former propane marketing operations, bio-energy facilities,
    petroleum products and natural gas pipelines;

•

Discontinued petroleum refining facilities;

•

Former exploration and production and mining operations.

These costs include certain conditions at specified locations
related primarily to soil and groundwater contamination and any
penalty assessed on Williams Refining &
Marketing, L.L.C. (Williams Refining) associated with
noncompliance with the EPA’s National Emission Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). In 2002, Williams
Refining submitted to the EPA a self-disclosure letter
indicating noncompliance with those regulations. This
unintentional noncompliance had occurred due to a regulatory
interpretation that resulted in under-counting the total annual
benzene level at Williams Refining’s Memphis refinery. Also
in 2002, the EPA conducted an all-media audit of the Memphis
refinery. In 2004, Williams Refining and the new owner of the
Memphis refinery met with the EPA and the DOJ to discuss alleged
violations and proposed penalties due to noncompliance issues
identified in the report, including the benzene NESHAP issue. On
February 2, 2006, the DOJ confirmed our
agreement-in-principle to resolve the United States’ claims
against us for alleged violations. In connection with the sale
of the Memphis refinery in 2003, we also have an indemnity
dispute with the purchaser.

In 2004, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ)
issued a notice of violation (NOV) alleging various air permit
violations associated with our operation of the Dry Trail gas
processing plant prior to our sale of the facility. The NOV was
issued to our subsidiary, Williams Field Services Company (WFS),
and the purchaser of the plant. On April 14, 2005, the ODEQ
issued a letter to the current Dry Trail plant owners assessing
a penalty under the NOV of approximately $750,000. The current
owner has asserted an indemnification claim to us for payment of
the penalty. We are analyzing the proposed penalty and
negotiating a resolution with the current plant owner and the
ODEQ.

In 2004, our Gulf Liquids subsidiary initiated a self-audit of
all environmental conditions (air, water, waste) at three
facilities: Geismar, Sorrento, and Chalmette, Louisiana. The
audit revealed numerous infractions of Louisiana environmental
regulations and resulted in a Consolidated Compliance Order and
Notice of Potential Penalty from the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality (LDEQ). No specific penalty amount was
assessed. Instead, LDEQ was required by Louisiana law to demand
a profit and loss statement to determine the financial benefit
obtained by noncompliance and to assess a penalty accordingly.
Gulf Liquids offered $91,500 as a single, final, global
multi-media settlement. Subsequent negotiations have resulted in
a revised offer of $109,000, which LDEQ is currently reviewing.

Certain of our subsidiaries have been identified as potentially
responsible parties at various Superfund and state waste
disposal sites. In addition, these subsidiaries have incurred,
or are alleged to have incurred, various other hazardous
materials removal or remediation obligations under environmental
laws.

Summary of environmental matters

Actual costs incurred for these matters could be substantially
greater than amounts accrued depending on the actual number of
contaminated sites identified, the actual amount and extent of
contamination discovered, the final cleanup standards mandated
by the EPA and other governmental authorities and other factors.

Other Legal Matters

Royalty indemnifications

We are defending a lawsuit commenced in 1996 in which a producer
has asserted a claim against our Transco subsidiary for
indemnification relating to prior royalty payments. The producer
claimed damages, including interest calculated through
December 31, 2005, of approximately $11 million. The
Louisiana Court



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

of Appeals affirmed a lower court’s judgment in favor of
Transco, and the producer now seeks to have the case reviewed by
the Louisiana Supreme Court.

Will Price (formerly Quinque)

In 2001, fourteen of our entities were named as defendants in a
nationwide class action lawsuit in Kansas state court that had
been pending against other defendants, generally pipeline and
gathering companies, since 2000. The plaintiffs alleged that the
defendants have engaged in mismeasurement techniques that
distort the heating content of natural gas, resulting in an
alleged underpayment of royalties to the class of producer
plaintiffs and sought an unspecified amount of damages. The
fourth amended petition, which was filed in 2003, deleted all of
our defendant entities except two Midstream subsidiaries. All
remaining defendants have opposed class certification and a
hearing on plaintiffs’ second motion to certify the class
was held on April 1, 2005. We are awaiting a decision from
the court.

Grynberg

In 1998, the DOJ informed us that Jack Grynberg, an individual,
had filed claims on behalf of himself and the federal
government, in the United States District Court for the District
of Colorado under the False Claims Act against us and certain of
our wholly owned subsidiaries. The claims sought an unspecified
amount of royalties allegedly not paid to the federal
government, treble damages, a civil penalty, attorneys’
fees, and costs. In connection with our sales of Kern River Gas
Transmission and Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, we agreed
to indemnify the purchasers for any liability relating to this
claim, including legal fees. The maximum amount of future
payments that we could potentially be required to pay under
these indemnifications depends upon the ultimate resolution of
the claim and cannot currently be determined. Grynberg has also
filed claims against approximately 300 other energy companies
alleging that the defendants violated the False Claims Act in
connection with the measurement, royalty valuation and purchase
of hydrocarbons. In 1999, the DOJ announced that it was
declining to intervene in any of the Grynberg cases, including
the action filed in federal court in Colorado against us. Also
in 1999, the Panel on Multi-District Litigation transferred all
of these cases, including those filed against us, to the federal
court in Wyoming for pre-trial purposes. Grynberg’s
measurement claims remain pending against us and the other
defendants; the court previously dismissed Grynberg’s
royalty valuation claims. In May 2005, the court-appointed
special master entered a report which recommended that the
claims against our Gas Pipeline and Midstream subsidiaries be
dismissed but upheld the claims against our
Exploration & Production subsidiaries against our
jurisdictional challenge. The District Court is considering
whether to affirm or reject the special master’s
recommendations and heard oral arguments on December 9,
2005.

On August 6, 2002, Jack J. Grynberg, and
Celeste C. Grynberg, Trustee on Behalf of the Rachel Susan
Grynberg Trust, and the Stephen Mark Grynberg Trust, served us
and one of our Exploration & Production subsidiaries
with a complaint in the state court in Denver, Colorado. The
complaint alleges that we have used mismeasurement techniques
that distort the BTU heating content of natural gas, resulting
in the alleged underpayment of royalties to Grynberg and other
independent natural gas producers. The complaint also alleges
that we inappropriately took deductions from the gross value of
their natural gas and made other royalty valuation errors. Under
various theories of relief, the plaintiff is seeking actual
damages of between $2 million and $20 million based on
interest rate variations and punitive damages in the amount of
approximately $1.4 million. In 2004, Grynberg filed an
amended complaint against one of our Exploration &
Production subsidiaries. This subsidiary filed an answer in
January 2005, denying liability for the damages claimed. Trial
in this case has been set for May 2006, but the parties are
negotiating an agreement that would eliminate the measurement
claims and defer further proceedings on the royalty claims until
resolution of an appeal in another case.

Securities class actions

Numerous shareholder class action suits were filed against us in
2002 in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Oklahoma. The majority of the suits allege that we
and co-defendants, WilTel Communications (WilTel), previously an
owned subsidiary known as Williams Communications, and certain
corporate officers, have acted jointly and separately to inflate
the stock price of both companies. Other suits allege similar
causes of action related to a public offering in early January
2002 known as the FELINE PACS offering. These cases were also
filed in 2002 against us, certain corporate officers, all
members of our board of directors and all of the offerings’
underwriters. WilTel is no longer a defendant as a result of its
bankruptcy. These cases have all been consolidated and an order
has been issued requiring separate amended consolidated
complaints by our equity holders and WilTel equity holders. The
underwriter defendants have requested indemnification and
defense from these cases. If we grant the requested
indemnifications to the underwriters, any related settlement
costs will not be covered by our insurance policies. We are
currently covering the cost of defending the underwriters. In
2002, the amended complaints of the WilTel securities holders
and of our securities holders added numerous claims related to
Power. The parties are currently engaged in discovery, and the
trial date is currently set for August 16, 2006.
Preliminary settlement discussions have occurred. Derivative
shareholder suits have been filed in state court in Oklahoma all
based on similar allegations. The state court approved motions
to consolidate and to stay these Oklahoma suits pending action
by the federal court in the shareholder suits. We have directors
and officers insurance which we believe provides coverage for
these claims. However, it is reasonably possible that the
ultimate resolution of this litigation will include some amount
outside of insurance coverage. Based on the status of
proceedings through the date of this filing, a reasonable
estimate of such amount cannot be determined.

In addition, four class action complaints were filed against us,
the members of our Board of Directors and members of our
benefits and investment committees under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act by participants in our 401(k) plan. In
September 2005, the parties agreed to settle these consolidated
matters for $55 million. Of this amount, we have paid
$5 million and our insurance carriers paid
$50 million. This settlement received final approval at a
fairness hearing on November 16, 2005. The
U.S. Department of Labor was also independently
investigating our employee benefit plans but communicated its
decision on November 1, 2005, to close its investigation of
the 401(k) plan’s stock investments.

Federal income tax litigation

One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Transco Coal Gas Company,
is engaged in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
regarding the recapture of certain income tax credits associated
with the construction of a coal gasification plant in North
Dakota by Great Plains Gasification Associates, in which Transco
Coal Gas Company was a partner. The IRS has taken alternative
positions that allege a disposition date for purposes of tax
credit recapture that is earlier than the position taken in the
partnership tax return. On August 23, 2001, we filed a
petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest the adjustments
to the partnership tax return proposed by the IRS. Certain
settlement discussions have taken place since that date. During
the fourth quarter of 2004, we determined that a reasonable
settlement with the IRS could not be achieved. We filed a Motion
for Summary Judgment with the Tax Court, which was heard, and
denied, in January 2005. The matter was then tried before the
Tax Court in February 2005. We continue to believe that the
return position of the partnership is with merit. However, it is
reasonably possible that the Tax Court could render an
unfavorable decision that could ultimately result in estimated
income taxes and interest of up to approximately
$115 million in excess of the amount currently accrued.

TAPS Quality Bank

One of our subsidiaries, Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. (WAPI),
is actively engaged in administrative litigation being conducted
jointly by the FERC and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska
(RCA) concerning



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) Quality Bank. Primary
issues being litigated include the appropriate valuation of the
naphtha, heavy distillate, vacuum gas oil and residual product
cuts within the TAPS Quality Bank as well as the appropriate
retroactive effects of the determinations. Due to the sale of
WAPI’s interests on March 31, 2004, no future Quality
Bank liability will accrue but we are responsible for any
liability that existed as of that date including potential
liability for any retroactive payments that might be awarded in
these proceedings for the period prior to March 31, 2004.
In the third quarter of 2004, the FERC and RCA presiding
administrative law judges rendered their joint and individual
initial decisions. The initial decisions set forth methodologies
for determining the valuations of the product cuts under review
and also approved the retroactive application of the approved
methodologies for the heavy distillate and residual product
cuts. Based on our computation and assessment of ultimate ruling
terms that would be considered probable, we recorded an accrual
of approximately $134 million in the third quarter of 2004.
Because the application of certain aspects of the initial
decisions are subject to interpretation, we have calculated the
reasonably possible impact of the decisions, if fully adopted by
the FERC and RCA, to result in additional exposure to us of
approximately $32 million more than we have accrued at
December 31, 2005.

On October 20, 2005, the FERC and the RCA issued
substantially similar orders regarding the initial decisions.
Consistent with the 2005 Highway Reauthorization Bill enacted on
August 10, 2005, the two orders eliminate our retroactive
exposure for refunds prior to February 1, 2000. The orders
also generally affirm the initial decisions except for some
modifications to the residual product cuts valuation
methodology. We believe the overall impact of the change in
retroactive periods precludes our previously disclosed concerns
for reasonably possible exposure for amounts in addition to
those currently accrued.

In November 2005, ExxonMobil appealed the FERC’s decision
to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals asserting that the
FERC’s reliance on the Highway Reauthorization Act as the
basis for limiting the retroactive effect violates, among other
things, the separation of powers under the
U.S. Constitution by interfering with the FERC’s
independent decision-making role. ExxonMobil filed a similar
appeal in the Alaska Superior Court. We have appealed the
FERC’s order to the extent of its ruling on the West Coast
Heavy Distillate component. Decisions on these appeals are not
expected until late 2006 at the earliest.

Redondo Beach taxes

On February 5, 2005, Power received a tax assessment
letter, addressed to AES Redondo Beach, L.L.C. and Power, from
the city of Redondo Beach, California, in which the city
asserted that approximately $33 million in back taxes and
approximately $39 million in interest and penalties are
owed related to natural gas used at the generating facility
operated by AES Redondo Beach. On the same date, Power was
served with a subpoena from the city related to the tax
assessment. During July 2005, the city held hearings on this
matter. On September 23, 2005, the tax administrator for
the city issued a decision in which he found Power jointly and
severally liable with AES Redondo Beach for back taxes of
approximately $36 million and interest and penalties of
approximately $21 million. Both Power and AES Redondo Beach
have filed notices of appeal that will be heard at the city
level pursuant to a schedule that calls for a final
determination by May 19, 2006. On December 19, 2005,
Power received additional assessments from the city totaling
approximately $3 million in taxes (inclusive of interest
and penalties) for the period from October 1, 2004 through
September 30, 2005. In late January, 2006, we received an
additional assessment totaling approximately $270,000 (inclusive
of interest and penalties) for the period from October 1,
2005 through December 31, 2005. Power and AES Redondo Beach
have objected to these assessments and have requested a hearing
on them. We believe that under Power’s tolling agreement
related to the Redondo Beach generating facility, AES Redondo
Beach is responsible for taxes of the nature asserted by the
city; however, AES Redondo Beach has notified us that they do
not agree.

Gulf Liquids litigation

Gulf Liquids contracted with Gulsby Engineering Inc. (Gulsby)
and Gulsby-Bay for the construction of certain gas processing
plants in Louisiana. National American Insurance Company (NAICO)
and American Home Assurance Company provided payment and
performance bonds for the projects. Gulsby and Gulsby-Bay
defaulted on the construction contracts. In the fall of 2001,
the contractors, sureties, and Gulf Liquids filed multiple cases
in Louisiana and Texas. In January 2002, NAICO added Gulf
Liquids’ co-venturer Power to the suits as a third-party
defendant. Gulf Liquids has asserted claims against the
contractors and sureties for, among other things, breach of
contract requesting contractual and consequential damages from
$40 million to $80 million, any of which is subject to
a sharing arrangement with XL Insurance Company. The contractors
and sureties are asserting both contract and tort claims, some
of which appear to be duplicative, against Gulf Liquids, Power,
and others. The requested contractual and extra-contractual
damages range from $20 million to $90 million.

The cases filed in Harris County, Texas, have been consolidated.
Various motions for summary judgment are pending before the
court. Depending in part on the resolution of these various
motions, it is reasonably possible that the contractors and
sureties might be awarded damages against us in these various
cases for an amount up to $25 million. Trial in the Harris
County cases is set for March 27, 2006.

Hurricane lawsuits

We were named as a defendant in two class action petitions for
damages filed in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Louisiana in September and October 2005
arising from hurricanes that struck Louisiana in 2005. The class
plaintiffs, purporting to represent all persons, businesses and
entities in the State of Louisiana who have suffered damage as a
result of the winds and storm surge from the hurricanes, allege
that the operating activities of the two sub-classes of
defendants, which are all oil and gas pipelines that dredged
pipeline canals or installed pipelines in the marshes of south
Louisiana (including Transco) and all oil and gas exploration
and production companies which drilled for oil and gas or
dredged canals in the marshes of south Louisiana, have altered
marshland ecology and caused marshland destruction which
otherwise would have averted all or almost all of the
destruction and loss of life caused by the hurricanes.
Plaintiffs request that the court allow the lawsuits to proceed
as class actions and seek legal and equitable relief in an
unspecified amount. We are presently reviewing the petitions in
preparation for filing responsive pleadings in these cases.

Other Divestiture Indemnifications

Pursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to
divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain
purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect
to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities
provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions
and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities
that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. The
indemnities generally relate to breach of warranties, tax,
historic litigation, personal injury, environmental matters,
right of way and other representations that we have provided. At
December 31, 2005, we do not expect any of the indemnities
provided pursuant to the sales agreements to have a material
impact on our future financial position. However, if a claim for
indemnity is brought against us in the future, it may have a
material adverse effect on results of operations in the period
in which the claim is made.

In addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are
pending against us which are incidental to our operations.



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

Summary

Litigation, arbitration, regulatory matters, and environmental
matters are subject to inherent uncertainties. Were an
unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a
material adverse impact on the results of operations in the
period in which the ruling occurs. Management, including
internal counsel, currently believes that the ultimate
resolution of the foregoing matters, taken as a whole and after
consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage, recovery
from customers or other indemnification arrangements, will not
have a materially adverse effect upon our future financial
position.

Commitments

Power has entered into certain contracts giving it the right to
receive fuel conversion services as well as certain other
services associated with electric generation facilities that are
currently in operation throughout the continental United States.
At December 31, 2005, Power’s estimated committed
payments under these contracts range from approximately
$397 million to $420 million annually through 2017 and
decline over the remaining five years to $59 million in
2022. Total committed payments under these contracts over the
next seventeen years are approximately $5.9 billion. Total
payments made under these contracts during 2005, 2004, and 2003
were $403 million, $402 million, and
$394 million, respectively.

Commitments for construction and acquisition of property, plant
and equipment are approximately $222 million at
December 31, 2005.

Related Party Transactions

Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.

Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. was a related party as a result
of a director that served on both our Board of Directors and
Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.’s Board of Directors. On
May 20, 2004, this director retired from our Board of
Directors. In 2002, Williams Production RMT Company, a wholly
owned subsidiary, entered into a $900 million short-term
credit agreement dated July 31, 2002, with certain lenders
including a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. This
debt obligation was refinanced in second quarter 2003. Included
in

interest accrued

on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations for 2003 was $199.4 million of interest expense,
including amortization of deferred set up fees related to this
note. We paid $37.2 million to Lehman Brothers Holdings,
Inc. in 2003, primarily for underwriting fees related to debt
and equity issuances as well as strategic advisory and
restructuring success fees.

American Electric Power Company, Inc.

American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP) is a related party
as a result of a director that serves on both our Board of
Directors and AEP’s Board of Directors. In 2003, AEP paid
Power $90 million to resolve a dispute involving the
liquidation of a trading position. There were no other
significant transactions with AEP for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003.

Segment Disclosures

Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
different products and services. The segments are managed
separately because each segment requires different technology,
marketing strategies and industry knowledge. Other primarily
consists of corporate operations and certain continuing
operations that were included within the previously reported
International and Petroleum Services segments.

Performance Measurement

We currently evaluate performance based on

segment profit
(loss)

from operations, which includes

segment revenues

from external and internal customers,

segment costs and
expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization, equity
earnings (losses)

and

income (loss) from investments

including impairments related to investments accounted for
under the equity method. The accounting policies of the segments
are the same as those described in Note 1,

Description
of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

. Intersegment sales are generally
accounted for at current market prices as if the sales were to
unaffiliated third parties.

During 2004, Power was party to intercompany interest rate swaps
with the corporate parent, the effect of which is included in
Power’s

segment revenues

and

segment profit
(loss)

as shown in the reconciliation within the following
tables. We terminated all interest-rate derivatives in the
fourth quarter of 2004.

The majority of energy commodity hedging by certain of our
business units is done through intercompany derivatives with
Power which, in turn, enters into offsetting derivative
contracts with unrelated third parties. Power bears the
counterparty performance risks associated with the unrelated
third parties. External revenues of our Exploration &
Production segment includes third-party oil and gas sales, more
than offset by transportation expenses and royalties due third
parties on intercompany sales.

The following geographic area data includes

revenues from
external customers

based on product shipment origin and

long-lived assets

based upon physical location.

Our foreign operations are primarily located in Venezuela,
Canada, and Argentina.

Long-lived assets

are comprised of
property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible
assets.

SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES

(Unaudited)

The following information pertains to our oil and gas producing
activities and is presented in accordance with
SFAS No. 69, “Disclosures About Oil and Gas
Producing Activities.” The information is required to be
disclosed by geographic region. We have significant oil and gas
producing activities primarily in the Rocky Mountain and
Mid-continent areas of the United States. Additionally, we have
oil and gas producing activities in Argentina and Venezuela.
However, proved reserves and revenues related to international
activities are approximately 6.2 percent and
4.2 percent, respectively, of our total international and
domestic proved reserves and revenues. The following information
relates only to the oil and gas activities in the United States
and includes the activities of those properties that qualified
for reporting as discontinued operations in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations.

Results of operations

•

Results of operations for producing activities consist of all
    related domestic activities within the Exploration &
    Production reporting unit, including those operations that
    qualified for presentation as discontinued operations within our
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. Included above are the
    pretax results of operations and gains on sales of assets,
    reported as discontinued operations, of $60.2 million in
    2003. Other expenses in 2005 and 2004 include a $6 million
    and $16 million gain, respectively, on sales of securities
    associated with a coal seam royalty trust.

•

Oil and gas revenues consist primarily of natural gas production
    sold to the Power subsidiary and includes the impact of
    intercompany hedges.

•

Other revenues and other expenses consist of activities within
    the Exploration & Production segment that are not a direct
    part of the producing activities. These non-producing activities
    include acquisition and disposition of other working interest
    and royalty interest gas and the movement of gas from the
    wellhead to the tailgate of the respective plants for sale to
    the Power subsidiary or third

Proved reserves

•

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves
    (Rule

4-10(a)

of
    Regulation

S-X)

as
    the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural
    gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate
    with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from
    known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
    conditions. Our proved reserves consist of two categories,
    proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves.
    Proved developed reserves are currently producing wells and
    wells awaiting minor sales connection expenditure, recompletion,
    additional perforations or borehole stimulation treatments.
    Proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves which are
    expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or
    from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
    required for recompletion. Proved reserves on undrilled acreage
    are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units
    that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where
    it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity
    of production from the existing productive formation.

•

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.73 pounds per square
    inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil reserves are
    insignificant and have been included in the proved reserves on a
    basis of billion cubic feet equivalents (Bcfe).

Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
relating to proved oil and gas reserves

The following is based on the estimated quantities of proved
reserves and the year-end prices and costs. The average year end
natural gas prices used in the following estimates were $6.95,
$5.08, and $5.28 per mmcfe at December 31, 2005, 2004,
and 2003, respectively. Future income tax expenses have been
computed



THE WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS
DISCLOSURES — (Continued)

(Unaudited)

considering available carry forwards and credits and the
appropriate statutory tax rates. The discount rate of
10 percent is as prescribed by SFAS No. 69.
Continuation of year-end economic conditions also is assumed.
The calculation is based on estimates of proved reserves, which
are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are
not considered. The calculation also requires assumptions as to
the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the
timing and amount of future development and production costs. Of
the $2,258 million of future development costs,
$661 million, $727 million and $610 million are
estimated to be spent in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating volumes and
the value of proved reserves and in projecting future production
rates and timing of development expenditures. Such reserve
estimates are subject to change as additional information
becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the
timing of production may be substantially different from the
reserve estimates.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of the
Securities Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) was performed as
of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation
was performed under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable
assurance level.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls
will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, within the company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the control. The design of any system of controls also is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure
Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this
regard is that the Disclosure Controls will be modified as
systems change and conditions warrant.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

See “Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting” set forth in Item 8, Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.

Fourth Quarter 2005 Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

On October 1, 2005, we completed the final phase of system
implementations which are part of an enterprise initiative to
move to common enterprise accounting systems. This phase
impacted our Exploration & Production business segment and
represented a replacement of the primary accounting systems used
to process, accumulate and summarize accounting information. In
addition, the systems implemented also replaced previous systems
used to manage land lease records and division order interests.
As a result, some processes and related controls were modified
to address any changes resulting from the system implementation.

Other than as described above, there have been no changes in our
internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth
quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
