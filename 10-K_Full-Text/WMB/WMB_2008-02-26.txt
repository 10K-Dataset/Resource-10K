GENERAL

We are a natural gas company originally incorporated under the
    laws of the state of Nevada in 1949 and reincorporated under the
    laws of the state of Delaware in 1987. We were founded in 1908
    when two Williams brothers began a construction company in
    Fort Smith, Arkansas. Today, we primarily find, produce,
    gather, process and transport natural gas. Our operations are
    concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Gulf
    Coast, and the Eastern Seaboard.

We continue to use Economic Value
    Added

®

(EVA

®

)


as the basis for disciplined decision making around the use of
    capital.
    EVA

®

is a tool that considers both financial earnings and a cost of
    capital in measuring performance. It is based on the idea that
    earning profits from an economic perspective requires that a
    company cover not only all of its operating expenses but also
    all of its capital costs. The two main components of
    EVA

®

are net operating profit after taxes and a charge for the
    opportunity cost of capital. We derive these amounts by making
    various adjustments to our reported results and financial
    position, and by applying a cost of capital. We look for
    opportunities to improve
    EVA

®

because we believe there is a strong correlation between
    EVA

®

improvement and creation of shareholder value.

Our goal is to create superior sustainable growth in
    EVA

®

and shareholder value. In early 2006, we set some ambitious
    three-year goals referred to as our game plan for growth. Our
    success in achieving the game plan for growth contributed to our
    significant accomplishments in 2007 designed to increase
    shareholder value, including:

•

As a result of the sale of substantially all of our power assets
    to Bear Energy LP, a unit of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.
    (NYSE: BSC) and strong business performance, our credit ratings
    were raised to investment grade.

•

Continuing to increase our natural gas production through
    organic growth — natural gas production increased by
    21 percent for the year.

    HIGHLIGHTS

During third-quarter 2007, we formed Williams Pipeline Partners
    L.P. (WMZ) to own and operate natural gas transportation and
    storage assets. In January 2008, WMZ completed its initial
    public offering of 16.25 million common units at a price of
    $20.00 per unit. The underwriters also exercised their option to
    purchase an additional 1.65 million common units at the
    same price.

In December 2007, Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ) acquired certain
    of our membership interests in Wamsutter LLC, the limited
    liability company that owns the Wamsutter system, from us for
    $750 million.

In December 2007, we repurchased $213 million of
    7.125 percent notes due September 2011 and $22 million
    of 8.125 percent notes due March 2012.

On November 28, 2007, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
    Corporation (Transco) filed a formal stipulation and agreement
    with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) resolving
    all substantive issues in Transco’s pending 2006 rate case.
    Final resolution of the rate case is subject to approval by the
    FERC.

On November 9, 2007, we closed on the sale of substantially
    all of our power business to Bear Energy, LP, a unit of The Bear
    Stearns Companies, Inc., for $496 million, subject to
    post-closing adjustments. The assets sold included tolling
    contracts, full requirements contracts, tolling resales, heat
    rate options, related hedges and other related assets including
    certain property and software. This sale reduces the risk and
    complexity of our overall business.

In November 2007, our credit ratings were raised to investment
    grade based on improvements in our credit outlook. As we
    continue to invest and grow our natural gas businesses, our
    improved credit rating is expected to provide greater access to
    capital and more favorable loan terms. See additional discussion
    of credit ratings in

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition

.

In July 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
    of up to $1 billion of our common stock. We intend to
    purchase shares of our stock from time to time in open-market
    transactions or through privately negotiated or structured
    transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and
    other factors. This stock-repurchase program does not have an
    expiration date. During 2007, we repurchased approximately
    16 million shares for $526 million (including
    transaction costs) at an average cost of $33.08 per share.

In April 2007, our Board of Directors approved a regular
    quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, which reflects an
    increase of 11 percent compared to the 9 cents per share
    that we paid in each of the four prior quarters and marks the
    fourth increase in our dividend since late 2004.

On March 30, 2007, the FERC approved the stipulation and
    settlement agreement with respect to the rate case for Northwest
    Pipeline GP (Northwest Pipeline), formerly Northwest Pipeline
    Corporation.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Substantially all our operations are conducted through our
    subsidiaries. To achieve organizational and operating
    efficiencies, our activities are primarily operated through the
    following business segments:

•

Exploration & Production

— produces,
    develops and manages natural gas reserves primarily located in
    the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States and is comprised of several wholly owned and partially
    owned subsidiaries including Williams Production Company LLC and
    Williams Production RMT Company.

•

Gas Pipeline

— includes our interstate natural
    gas pipelines and pipeline joint venture investments organized
    under our wholly owned subsidiary, Williams Gas Pipeline
    Company, LLC. Gas Pipeline also includes WMZ, our master limited
    partnership formed in 2007.

•

Midstream Gas & Liquids

— includes
    our natural gas gathering, treating and processing business and
    is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned
    subsidiaries including Williams Field Services Group LLC and
    Williams Natural Gas Liquids, Inc. Midstream also includes WPZ,
    our master limited partnership formed in 2005.

•

Gas Marketing Services

— manages our natural gas
    commodity risk through purchases, sales and other related
    transactions, under our wholly owned subsidiary Williams Gas
    Marketing, Inc.

•

Other

— primarily consists of corporate
    operations.  Other also includes our interest in
    Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn).

This report is organized to reflect this structure.

Detailed discussion of each of our business segments follows.

Exploration &
    Production

Our Exploration & Production segment, which is
    comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned
    subsidiaries, including Williams Production Company LLC and
    Williams Production RMT Company (RMT), produces, develops, and
    manages natural gas reserves primarily located in the Rocky
    Mountain (primarily New Mexico, Wyoming and Colorado) and
    Mid-Continent (Oklahoma and Texas) regions of the United States.
    We specialize in natural gas production from tight-sands and
    shale formations and coal bed methane reserves in the Piceance,
    San Juan, Powder River, Arkoma, Green River and
    Fort Worth basins. Over 99 percent of
    Exploration & Production’s domestic reserves are
    natural gas. Our Exploration & Production segment also
    has international oil and gas interests, which include a
    69 percent equity interest in Apco Argentina Inc. (Apco
    Argentina), an oil and gas exploration and production company
    with operations in Argentina, and a four percent equity interest
    in Petrowayu S.A., a Venezuelan corporation that is the operator
    of a 100 percent interest in the La Concepcion block
    located in Western Venezuela.

Exploration & Production’s primary strategy is to
    utilize its expertise in the development of tight-sands, shale,
    and coal bed methane reserves. Exploration &
    Production’s current proved undeveloped and probable
    reserves provide us with strong capital investment opportunities
    for several years into the future. Exploration &
    Production’s goal is to drill its existing proved
    undeveloped reserves, which comprise approximately
    46 percent of proved reserves and to drill in areas of
    probable reserves. In addition, Exploration &
    Production provides a significant amount of equity production
    that is gathered

and/or

processed by our Midstream facilities in the San Juan basin.

Information for our Exploration & Production segment
    relates only to domestic activity unless otherwise noted. We use
    the terms “gross” to refer to all wells or acreage in
    which we have at least a partial working interest and
    “net” to refer to our ownership represented by that
    working interest.



Gas
    reserves and wells

The following table summarizes our U.S. natural gas
    reserves as of December 31 (using market prices on December 31
    held constant) for the year indicated:




(Bcfe)

Proved developed natural gas reserves

Proved undeveloped natural gas reserves

1,756

1,739

Total proved natural gas reserves

4,143

3,701

3,382

No major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has
    caused a significant change in estimated gas reserves since
    year-end 2007. We have not filed on a recurring basis estimates
    of our total proved net oil and gas reserves with any
    U.S. regulatory authority or agency other than the
    Department of Energy (DOE) and the SEC. The estimates furnished
    to the DOE have been consistent with those furnished to the SEC,
    although Exploration & Production has not yet filed
    any information with respect to its estimated total reserves at
    December 31, 2007, with the DOE. Certain estimates filed
    with the DOE may not necessarily be directly comparable due to
    special DOE reporting requirements, such as the requirement to
    report gross operated reserves only. In 2006 and 2005 the
    underlying estimated reserves for the DOE did not differ by more
    than five percent from the underlying estimated reserves
    utilized in preparing the estimated reserves reported to the SEC.

Approximately 98 percent of our year-end 2007 United States
    proved reserves estimates were audited in each separate basin by
    Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI). When
    compared on a

well-by-well

basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than
    the estimates of NSAI. However, in the opinion of NSAI, the
    estimates of our proved reserves are in the aggregate reasonable
    by basin and have been prepared in accordance with generally
    accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. These
    principles are set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the
    Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserve Information
    promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. NSAI is
    satisfied with our methods and procedures in preparing the
    December 31, 2007 reserve estimates and saw nothing of an
    unusual nature that would cause NSAI to take exception with the
    estimates, in the aggregate, as prepared by us. Reserve
    estimates related to properties underlying the Williams Coal
    Seam Gas Royalty Trust, which comprise approximately two percent
    of our total U.S. proved reserves, were prepared by Miller
    and Lents, LTD.

On December 12, 2007, the SEC issued a “Concept
    Release” to obtain information about the extent and nature
    of the public’s interest in revising oil and gas reserves
    disclosure requirements which exist in their current form in

Regulation S-K

and

Regulation S-X

under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
    of 1934. The Commission adopted the current oil and gas reserves
    disclosure requirement between 1978 and 1982. The Concept
    Release is intended to address significant changes in the oil
    and gas industry. Some commentators have expressed concern that
    the Commission’s rules have not adapted to current
    practices and may not provide investors with the most useful
    picture of oil and gas reserves public companies hold. Comments
    were due to the Commission on February 19, 2008. At this
    time it is not possible to determine what effect changes the SEC
    may make, if any, will have on our reserve estimates and
    disclosures.

Piceance
    basin

The Piceance basin is located in northwestern Colorado and is
    our largest area of concentrated development. During 2007 we
    operated an average of 25 drilling rigs in the basin. As of
    December 2007, 14 of these rigs were the new high efficiency
    rigs designed to drill up to 22 wells from one location.
    This area has approximately 1,760 undrilled proved locations in
    inventory. Within this basin we own and operate natural gas
    gathering facilities including some 280 miles of gathering
    lines and associated field compression. Approximately 88% of the
    gas gathered is our own equity production. The gathering system
    also includes six processing plants and associated treating
    facilities with a total capacity of 900,000 Mcfd. During
    2007, these plants recovered approximately 54 million
    gallons of natural gas liquids (NGL’s) which were marketed
    separately from the residue natural gas.

San Juan
    basin

The San Juan basin is located in northwest New Mexico and
    southwest Colorado.

Powder
    River basin

The Powder River basin is located in northeast Wyoming. The
    Powder River basin includes large areas with multiple coal seam
    potential, targeting thick coal bed methane formations at
    shallow depths. We have a significant inventory of undrilled
    locations, providing long-term drilling opportunities.

Mid-Continent
    properties

The Mid-Continent properties are located in the southeastern
    Oklahoma portion of the Arkoma basin and the Barnett Shale in
    the Fort Worth basin of Texas.

Other
    properties

Other properties are primarily comprised of interests in the
    Green River basin in southwestern Wyoming. Also included is
    exploration activity and other miscellaneous activity.

Operating
    statistics

We focus on lower-risk development drilling. Our drilling
    success rate was 99 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The
    following tables summarize domestic drilling activity by number
    and type of well for the periods indicated:

Because we currently have a low-risk drilling program in proven
    basins, the main component of risk that we manage is price risk.
    In February 2007, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks in order to reduce margin
    requirements related to our hedging activities as well as lower
    transaction fees. Margin requirements, if any, under this new
    facility are dependent on the level of hedging with the banks
    and on natural gas reserves value. Exploration &
    Production natural gas hedges for 2008 domestic natural gas
    production consist of NYMEX fixed price contracts of 70 MMcf/d
    (whole year) and approximately 397 MMcf/d in regional collars
    (whole year). Our natural gas production hedges in 2007
    consisted of 172 MMcf/d in NYMEX fixed price hedges and an
    additional 271 MMcf/d in NYMEX and basin level collars. A collar
    is an option contract that sets a gas price floor and ceiling
    for a certain volume of natural gas. Hedging decisions are made
    considering the overall Williams commodity risk exposure and are
    not executed independently by Exploration &
    Production; there are expected future gas purchases for other
    Williams entities which when taken as a net position may offset
    price risk related to Exploration & Production’s
    expected future gas sales.

Acquisitions &
    divestitures

Through transactions totaling approximately $77 million,
    Exploration & Production expanded its acreage position
    and purchased producing properties in the Fort Worth basin
    in north-central Texas and also expanded its acreage position in
    the Highlands area of the Piceance basin.

In January 2008, we sold a contractual right to a production
    payment on certain future international hydrocarbon production
    in Peru for approximately $148 million. We have received
    $118 million in cash and $29 million has been placed
    in escrow subject to certain post-closing conditions and
    adjustments. We will recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately
    $118 million in the first quarter of 2008 related to the
    initial cash received. As a result of the contract termination,
    we have no further interests associated with the crude oil
    concession. We had obtained these interests through our
    acquisition of Barrett Resources Corporation in 2001.



Other
    information

In 1993, Exploration & Production conveyed a net
    profits interest in certain of its properties to the Williams
    Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust. Substantially all of the production
    attributable to the properties conveyed to the trust was from
    the Fruitland coal formation and constituted coal seam gas. We
    subsequently sold trust units to the public in an underwritten
    public offering and retained 3,568,791 trust units then
    representing 36.8 percent of outstanding trust units. We
    have previously sold trust units on the open market, with our
    last sales in June 2005. As of February 1, 2008, we own
    789,291 trust units.

International
    exploration and production interests

We also have investments in international oil and gas interests.
    If combined with our domestic proved reserves, our international
    interests would make up approximately 3.6 percent of our
    total proved reserves.

Gas
    Pipeline

We own and operate, through Williams Gas Pipeline Company, LLC
    (WMZ) and its subsidiaries, a combined total of approximately
    14,200 miles of pipelines with a total annual throughput of
    approximately 2,700 trillion British Thermal Units of natural
    gas and

peak-day

delivery capacity of approximately 12 MMdt of gas. Gas
    Pipeline consists of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation
    and Northwest Pipeline GP. Gas Pipeline also holds interests in
    joint venture interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline
    systems including a 50 percent interest in Gulfstream
    Natural Gas System, L.L.C. Gas Pipeline also includes our new
    master limited partnership, Williams Pipeline Partners, L.P.

Transcontinental
    Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco)

Transco is an interstate natural gas transportation company that
    owns and operates a 10,300-mile natural gas pipeline system
    extending from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the offshore
    Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North
    Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to
    the New York City metropolitan area. The system serves customers
    in Texas and 11 southeast and Atlantic seaboard states,
    including major metropolitan areas in Georgia, North Carolina,
    New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2007, Transco’s system had a mainline
    delivery capacity of approximately 4.7 MMdt of natural gas
    per day from its production areas to its primary markets. Using
    its Leidy Line along with market-area storage and transportation
    capacity, Transco can deliver an additional 3.7 MMdt of
    natural gas per day for a system-wide delivery capacity total of
    approximately 8.4 MMdt of natural gas per day.
    Transco’s system includes 45 compressor stations, five
    underground storage fields, two liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    storage facilities. Compression facilities at a sea level-rated
    capacity total approximately 1.5 million horsepower.

Transco’s major natural gas transportation customers are
    public utilities and municipalities that provide service to
    residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation end
    users. Shippers on Transco’s system include public
    utilities, municipalities, intrastate pipelines, direct
    industrial users, electrical generators, gas marketers and
    producers. One customer accounted for approximately
    12 percent of Transco’s total revenues in 2007.
    Transco’s firm transportation agreements are generally
    long-term agreements with various expiration dates and account
    for the major portion of Transco’s business. Additionally,
    Transco offers storage services and interruptible transportation
    services under short-term agreements.

Transco has natural gas storage capacity in five underground
    storage fields located on or near its pipeline system or market
    areas and operates three of these storage fields. Transco also
    has storage capacity in an LNG storage facility and operates the
    facility. The total usable gas storage capacity available to
    Transco and its customers in such underground storage fields and
    LNG storage facility and through storage service contracts is
    approximately 216 billion cubic feet of gas. In addition,
    wholly owned subsidiaries of Transco operate and hold a
    35 percent ownership interest in Pine Needle LNG Company,
    LLC, an LNG storage facility with 4 billion cubic feet of
    storage



capacity. Storage capacity permits Transco’s customers to
    inject gas into storage during the summer and off-peak periods
    for delivery during peak winter demand periods.

    in the market area. Long-haul transportation involves gas that
    Transco receives in one of the production-area



zones and delivers to a market-area zone. Market-area
    transportation involves gas that Transco both receives and
    delivers within the market-area zones. Production-area
    transportation involves gas that Transco both receives and
    delivers within the production-area zones.

Northwest
    Pipeline GP (Northwest Pipeline)

Northwest Pipeline is an interstate natural gas transportation
    company that owns and operates a natural gas pipeline system
    extending from the San Juan basin in northwestern New
    Mexico and southwestern Colorado through Colorado, Utah,
    Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington to a point on the Canadian
    border near Sumas, Washington. Northwest Pipeline provides
    services for markets in California, Arizona, New Mexico,
    Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington
    directly or indirectly through interconnections with other
    pipelines.

Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2007, Northwest Pipeline’s system,
    having long-term firm transportation agreements with peaking
    capacity of approximately 3.4 MMdt of natural gas per day,
    was composed of approximately 3,900 miles of mainline and
    lateral transmission pipelines and 41 transmission compressor
    stations having a combined sea level-rated capacity of
    approximately 473,000 horsepower.

Northwest implemented new rates effective January 1, 2007
    that were approved by FERC. The rate case settlement established
    that general system firm transportation rates on
    Northwest’s system increased from $0.30760 to $0.40984 per
    Dth.

In 2007, Northwest Pipeline served a total of 132 transportation
    and storage customers. Transportation customers include
    distribution companies, municipalities, interstate and
    intrastate pipelines, gas marketers and direct industrial users.
    The two largest customers of Northwest Pipeline in 2007
    accounted for approximately 20 percent and
    11.5 percent, of its total operating revenues. No other
    customer accounted for more than 10 percent of Northwest
    Pipeline’s total operating revenues in 2007. Northwest
    Pipeline’s firm transportation agreements are generally
    long-term agreements with various expiration dates and account
    for the major portion of Northwest Pipeline’s business.
    Additionally, Northwest Pipeline offers interruptible and
    short-term firm transportation service.

As a part of its transportation services, Northwest Pipeline
    utilizes underground storage facilities in Utah and Washington
    enabling it to balance daily receipts and deliveries. Northwest
    Pipeline also owns and operates an LNG storage facility in
    Washington that provides service for customers during a few days
    of extreme demands. These storage facilities have an aggregate
    firm delivery capacity of approximately 600 million cubic
    feet of gas per day.

Northwest
    Pipeline expansion projects

The pipeline projects listed below were completed during 2007 or
    are future pipeline projects for which we have customer
    commitments.

Jackson
    Prairie Underground Expansion

The Jackson Prairie Storage Project, connected to
    Northwest’s transmission system near Chehalis, Washington,
    is operated by Puget Sound Energy and is jointly owned by
    Northwest, Puget Sound Energy and Avista Corporation. A phased
    capacity expansion is currently underway and a deliverability
    expansion is planned for 2008. Northwest’s one-third
    interest in the project includes 104 MMcf per day of
    planned 2008 deliverability expansion and approximately
    1.2 Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity to be
    developed over approximately a four year period from 2007
    through 2010. Northwest’s one-third share of the cost of
    the deliverability expansion is estimated to be
    $16 million. Northwest’s estimated capital cost for
    the capacity expansion component of the new storage service is
    $6.1 million, primarily for base natural gas.

Colorado
    Hub Connection Project

Northwest has proposed installing a new lateral to connect the
    White River Hub near Meeker, Colorado to Northwest’s
    mainline near Sand Springs, Colorado. This project is referred
    to as the Colorado Hub



Connection, or CHC Project. It is estimated that the
    construction of the CHC Project would cost up to
    $53 million and could begin service as early as November
    2009.

Parachute
    Lateral

Northwest placed its Parachute Lateral facilities in service on
    May 16, 2007, and began collecting revenues of
    approximately $0.87 million per month. The expansion
    increased capacity by 450 Mdt/d at a cost of approximately
    $86 million.

On August 24, 2007, Northwest filed an application with
    FERC to amend its certificate of public convenience and
    necessity issued for the Parachute Lateral to allow the transfer
    of the ownership of its Parachute Lateral facilities to a newly
    created entity, Parachute Pipeline LLC (Parachute), which is
    owned by Midstream through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries
    Williams Field Services Company, LLC (Williams Field Services).
    This application was approved by FERC on November 15, 2007,
    and Northwest sold the Parachute on December 31, 2007. The
    Parachute Lateral facilities are located in Rio Blanco and
    Garfield counties, Colorado.

As contemplated in the application for amendment, Parachute has
    leased the facilities back to Northwest, and as a result of the
    sale has become a Midstream subsidiary. Northwest will continue
    to operate the facilities under the FERC certificate. When
    Midstream completes its Willow Creek Processing Plant, the lease
    (subject to further regulatory approval) will terminate, and
    Parachute will assume full operational control and
    responsibility for the Parachute Lateral.

    does not involve the construction of additional mainline
    capacity.

Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C.
    (Gulfstream)

Gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system extending from the
    Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in Florida. Gas Pipeline
    and Spectra Energy (formerly known as Duke Energy), through
    their respective subsidiaries, each holds a 50 percent
    ownership interest in Gulfstream and provides operating services
    for Gulfstream. At December 31, 2007, our equity investment
    in Gulfstream was $439 million.

Gulfstream
    expansion projects

Gulfstream has entered into a precedent agreement and a related
    firm transportation service agreement pursuant to which, subject
    to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and other
    conditions precedent therein, Gulfstream intends to extend the
    pipeline system into South Florida and fully subscribe the
    remaining 345 Mdt/d of firm capacity on the existing pipeline
    system on a long-term basis. The estimated capital cost of this
    project is anticipated to be up to approximately
    $130 million, with Gas Pipeline’s share being
    50 percent of such costs. Gulfstream also has executed a
    precedent agreement and a related firm transportation service
    agreement pursuant to which, subject to the receipt of all
    necessary regulatory approvals and other conditions precedent
    therein, it intends to construct and fully subscribe on a
    long-term basis the first incremental expansion of



Gulfstream’s mainline capacity, increasing the current
    mainline capacity of 1.1 MMdt/d to 1.255 MMdt/d. The
    estimated capital cost of this expansion is anticipated to be up
    to approximately $153 million, with Gas Pipeline’s
    share being 50 percent of such costs. No significant
    increase in operations personnel is expected as a result of
    these two projects.

Williams
    Pipeline Partners L.P

WMZ was formed to own and operate natural gas transportation and
    storage assets. We currently own approximately 45.7 percent
    limited partnership interest and a 2 percent general
    partner interest in WMZ. WMZ provides us with lower cost of
    capital that is expected to enable growth of our Gas Pipeline
    business. WMZ also creates a vehicle to monetize our qualifying
    assets. Such transactions, which are subject to approval by the
    boards of directors of Williams and WMZ’s general partner,
    allow us to retain control of the assets through our ownership
    interest in WMZ. A subsidiary of ours serves as the general
    partner of WMZ. The initial asset of WMZ is a 35 percent
    interest in Northwest Pipeline.

Midstream
    Gas & Liquids

Our Midstream segment, one of the nation’s largest natural
    gas gatherers and processors, has primary service areas
    concentrated in the major producing basins in Colorado, New
    Mexico, Wyoming, the Gulf of Mexico, Venezuela and western
    Canada. Midstream’s primary businesses — natural
    gas gathering, treating, and processing; NGL fractionation,
    storage and transportation; and oil transportation —
    fall within the middle of the process of taking natural gas and
    crude oil from the wellhead to the consumer. NGLs, ethylene and
    propylene are extracted/produced at our plants, including our
    Canadian and Gulf Coast olefins plants. These products are used
    primarily for the manufacture of plastics, home heating and
    refinery feedstock.

Although most of our gas services are performed for a
    volumetric-based fee, a portion of our gas processing contracts
    are commodity-based and include two distinct types of commodity
    exposure. The first type includes “Keep Whole”
    processing contracts whereby we own the rights to the value from
    NGLs recovered at our plants and have the obligation to replace
    the lost heating value with natural gas. Under these contracts,
    we are exposed to the spread between NGLs and natural gas
    prices. The second type consists of “Percent of
    Liquids” contracts whereby we receive a portion of the
    extracted liquids with no direct exposure to the price of
    natural gas. Under these contracts, we are only exposed to NGL
    price movements.

Our Canadian and Gulf Liquids olefin facilities have commodity
    price exposure. In Canada, we are exposed to the spread between
    the price for natural gas and the olefinic products we produce.
    In the Gulf Coast, our feedstock for the ethane cracker is
    ethane and propane; as a result, we are exposed to the price
    spread between ethane and propane and ethylene and propylene. In
    the Gulf Coast, we also purchase refinery grade propylene and
    fractionate it into polymer grade propylene and propane; as a
    result we are exposed to the price spread between those
    commodities.

Key variables for our business will continue to be:

•

retaining and attracting customers by continuing to provide
    reliable services;

•

revenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either
    completed or currently under construction;

•

disciplined growth in our core service areas;

•

prices impacting our commodity-based processing and olefin
    activities.

Gathering
    and processing

We own

and/or

operate domestic gas gathering and processing assets primarily
    within the western states of Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico,
    and the onshore and offshore shelf and deepwater areas in and
    around the Gulf Coast states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi
    and Alabama. These assets consist of approximately
    8,700 miles of gathering pipelines, nine processing plants
    (one partially owned) and five natural gas treating plants with
    a combined daily inlet capacity of nearly 6.5 billion cubic
    feet per day. Some of these assets are owned through our
    interest in WPZ (see William Partners L.P. section below).



Geographically, our Midstream natural gas assets are positioned
    to maximize commercial and operational synergies with our other
    assets. For example, most of our offshore gathering and
    processing assets attach and process or condition natural gas
    supplies delivered to the Transco pipeline. Also, our gathering
    and processing facilities in the San Juan Basin handle
    about 85 percent of our Exploration & Production
    group’s wellhead production in this basin. Both our
    San Juan Basin and Southwest Wyoming systems deliver gas
    volumes into Northwest Pipeline’s interstate system in
    addition to third party interstate systems.

Included in the natural gas assets listed above are the assets
    of Discovery Producer Services LLC and its subsidiary Discovery
    Gas Transmission Services LLC (Discovery). WPZ owns a partial
    interest in Discovery and we operate its facilities.
    Discovery’s assets include a cryogenic natural gas
    processing plant near Larose, Louisiana, a natural gas liquids
    fractionator plant near Paradis, Louisiana and an offshore
    natural gas gathering and transportation system in the Gulf of
    Mexico.

In addition to these natural gas assets, we own and operate
    three crude oil pipelines totaling approximately 310 miles
    with a capacity of more than 300,000 barrels per day. This
    includes our Mountaineer, Alpine and BANJO crude oil pipeline
    systems in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

The BANJO oil pipeline and Seahawk gas pipeline run parallel and
    deliver production across two producer-owned spar-type floating
    production systems from the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
    (Anadarko) operated Boomvang and Nansen field areas in the
    western Gulf of Mexico. These pipelines were placed in service
    in 2002.

Our 18 inch oil pipeline, Alpine, which became operational
    in 2003, is our second western gulf crude oil pipeline. The
    pipeline extends 96 miles from Garden Banks Block 668
    in the central Gulf of Mexico to our

shallow-water

platform at Galveston Area Block A244. From this platform, the
    oil is delivered onshore through ExxonMobil’s Hoover
    Offshore Oil Pipeline System under a joint tariff agreement.
    This production is coming from the Gunnison field, which is
    located in 3,150 feet of water and operated by Anadarko.

Our Devils Tower floating production system and associated
    pipelines were placed in service in 2004. Initially built to
    serve the Devils Tower field, the floating production system is
    located in Mississippi Canyon Block 773, approximately
    150 miles south-southwest of Mobile, Alabama. During the
    fourth quarter of 2005, the platform’s service expanded to
    include tie-backs of production from the Triton and Goldfinger
    fields in addition to the host Devils Tower field. Construction
    is currently underway to add topside capacity for the recently
    dedicated Bass Lite gas discovery. Full field production from
    Bass Lite is expected mid-year 2008. Located in 5,610 feet
    of water, it is the world’s deepest dry tree spar. The
    platform, which is operated by ENI Petroleum on our behalf, is
    capable of producing

60 MMcf/d

of natural gas and 60 Mbbls/d of oil.

The Devils Tower project includes gas and oil pipelines. The

139-mile

Canyon Chief gas pipeline consists of

18-inch

diameter pipe. The

155-mile

Mountaineer oil pipeline is a combination of 18- and

20-inch

diameter pipe. The gas is delivered into Transco’s
    pipeline, and processed at our Mobile Bay plant to recover the
    NGLs. The oil is transported to ChevronTexaco’s Empire
    Terminal in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. These associated
    pipelines are significantly oversized relative to the Devils
    Tower spar top-side capacity.

Gulf
    Coast petrochemical and olefins

We own a 10/12 interest in and are the operator for an ethane
    cracker at Geismar, Louisiana, with a total production capacity
    of 1.3 billion pounds per year of ethylene. In July 2007,
    we exercised our right of first refusal to acquire BASF’s
    5/12

th

ownership
    interest in the Geismar olefins facility bringing our ownership
    position up to the current 10/12 interest. We also own an ethane
    pipeline system and a propylene splitter and its related
    pipeline system in Louisiana.

Canada

Our Canadian operations include an olefin liquids extraction
    plant located near Ft. McMurray, Alberta and an olefin
    fractionation facility near Edmonton, Alberta. Our facilities
    extract olefinic liquids from the off-gas produced from third
    party oil sands bitumen upgrading and then fractionate, treat,
    store, terminal and sell the propane, propylene, butane and
    condensate recovered from this process. We continue to be the
    only olefins fractionator in Western Canada and the only
    treater-processor of oil sands upgrader off-gas. These
    operations extract valuable



petrochemical feedstocks from upgrader off-gas streams allowing
    the upgraders to burn cleaner natural gas streams and reduce
    overall air emissions. The extraction plant has processing
    capacity in excess of

100 MMcf/d

with the ability to recover in excess of 15 Mbbls/d of
    olefin and NGL products.

Venezuela

Our Venezuelan investments involve gas compression and gas
    processing and natural gas liquids fractionation operations. We
    own controlling interests and operate three gas compressor
    facilities which provide roughly 70 percent of the gas
    injections in eastern Venezuela. These facilities help stabilize
    the reservoir and enhance the recovery of crude oil by
    re-injecting natural gas at high pressures. We also own a
    49.25 percent interest in two

400 MMcf/d

natural gas liquids extraction plants, a 50,000 barrels per
    day natural gas liquids fractionation plant and associated
    storage and refrigeration facilities.

Other

We own interests in

and/or

operate NGL fractionation and storage assets. These assets
    include two partially owned NGL fractionation facilities near
    Conway, Kansas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana that have a combined
    capacity in excess of 167,000 barrels per day. We also own
    approximately 20 million barrels of NGL storage capacity in
    central Kansas. Some of these assets are owned through our
    interest in WPZ.

We also own a 14.6% interest in Aux Sable Liquid Products and
    its Channahon, Illinois gas processing and NGL fractionation
    facility near Chicago. The facility is capable of processing up
    to 2.1 Bcf/d of natural gas from the Alliance Pipeline
    system and fractionating approximately 87,000 barrels per
    day of extracted liquids into NGL products.

Williams
    Partners L.P (WPZ)

WPZ was formed to engage in the business of gathering,
    transporting and processing natural gas and fractionating and
    storing NGLs. We currently own approximately a 21.6 percent
    limited partnership interest and a 2 percent general
    partner interest in WPZ. WPZ provides us with lower cost of
    capital that is expected to enable growth of our Midstream
    business. WPZ also creates a vehicle to monetize our qualifying
    assets. Such transactions, which are subject to approval by the
    boards of directors of both Williams and WPZ’s general
    partner, allow us to retain control of the assets through our
    ownership interest in WPZ.

WPZ’s asset portfolio at its initial public offering in
    2005 consisted of a 40 percent interest in Discovery, the
    Carbonate Trend gathering pipeline, three integrated NGL storage
    facilities near Conway, Kansas and a 50 percent interest in
    an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas.

During 2006, WPZ acquired Williams Four Corners, LLC which owns
    a 3,500-mile natural gas gathering system in the San Juan
    Basin in New Mexico and Colorado with capacity of nearly
    2 Bcf/d; the Ignacio natural gas processing plant in
    Colorado and the Kutz and Lybrook natural gas processing plants
    in New Mexico, which have a combined processing capacity of
    760 MMcf/d; and the Milagro and Esperanza natural gas
    treating plants in New Mexico, which are designed to remove
    carbon dioxide from up to 750 MMcf of natural gas per day.

In June 2007, WPZ acquired an additional 20 percent
    interest in Discovery. WPZ now owns a 60 percent interest
    in the Discovery gathering, transportation, processing and NGL
    fractionation system, the remainder of which is owned by third
    parties.

In December 2007, WPZ acquired certain ownership interests in
    Wamsutter LLC from us for $750 million. Wamsutter LLC owns
    a 1,700 mile natural gas gathering system in the Washakie
    Basin in south-central Wyoming and the Echo Springs natural gas
    processing plant in Sweetwater County, Wyoming.

Expansion
    projects

Gathering
    and processing — west

During the first quarter of 2007, we completed construction at
    our existing gas processing complex located near Opal, Wyoming,
    to add a fifth cryogenic gas processing train capable of
    processing up to 350 MMcf/d,



bringing total Opal capacity to approximately 1.5 Bcf/d.
    This plant expansion increased Opal’s processing capacity
    by more than 30 percent and became operational during the
    first quarter.

In the first quarter of 2007, we also announced plans to
    construct and operate the Willow Creek facility a
    450 MMcf/d natural gas processing plant in the Piceance
    Basin of western Colorado, where Exploration and Production has
    its most significant volume of natural gas production, reserves
    and development activity. Exploration and Production’s
    existing Piceance Basin processing plants are primarily designed
    to condition the natural gas to meet quality specifications for
    pipeline transmission, not to maximize the extraction of NGLs.
    We expect the new Willow Creek facility to recover
    25,000 barrels per day of NGLs at startup, which is
    expected to be in the third quarter of 2009.

In December 2007, Midstream purchased the Parachute Lateral
    system from Gas Pipeline. The system is a 37.6-mile expansion,
    originally placed in service by Gas Pipelines in May 2007, and
    provides capacity of 450 Mdt/d through a 30-inch diameter line,
    transporting residue gas from the Piceance basin to the
    Greasewood Hub in northwest Colorado. The Willow Creek facility
    will straddle the Parachute Lateral pipeline and will process
    gas flowing through the pipeline. In an arrangement approved by
    the FERC, Midstream will lease the pipeline to Gas Pipeline, who
    will continue to operate the pipeline until completion of a
    planned FERC abandonment filing.

In addition, Midstream acquired an existing natural gas pipeline
    from Gas Pipeline, and has begun the process of converting it
    from natural gas to NGL service and constructing additional
    pipeline to create a pipeline alternative for NGLs currently
    being transported by truck from Exploration &
    Production’s existing Piceance basin processing plants to a
    major NGL transportation pipeline system.

In 2006, we entered into an agreement to develop new pipeline
    capacity for transporting NGLs from production areas in
    southwestern Wyoming to central Kansas. The other party to the
    agreement reimbursed us for the development costs we had
    incurred for the proposed pipeline and acquired 99 percent
    of the pipeline, known as Overland Pass Pipeline Company, LLC.
    We retained a 1 percent interest and have the option to
    increase our ownership to 50 percent and become the
    operator within two years of the pipeline becoming operational.

Start-up

is
    planned for mid-2008. Additionally, we have agreed to dedicate
    our equity NGL volumes from our two Wyoming plants and the new
    Willow Creek facility for transport under a long-term shipping
    agreement. The terms represent significant savings compared with
    the existing tariff and other alternatives considered.

Gathering
    and processing — deepwater projects

The deepwater Gulf continues to be an attractive growth area for
    our Midstream business. Since 1997, we have invested almost
    $1.3 billion in new midstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico.
    These facilities provide both onshore and offshore services
    through pipelines, platforms and processing plants. The new
    facilities could also attract incremental gas volumes to
    Transco’s pipeline system in the southeastern United States.

During 2007, we have continued construction activities on the
    Perdido Norte project which includes oil and gas lines that
    would expand the scale of our existing infrastructure in the
    western deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we
    completed agreements with certain producers to provide
    gathering, processing and transportation services over the life
    of the reserves. We also intend to expand our onshore Markham
    gas processing facility to adequately serve this new gas
    production. The scale of the project has increased to include
    additional pipeline and more efficient processing capacity and
    is now estimated to cost approximately $560 million and to
    be in service in the third quarter of 2009.

Chevron and Anadarko are dedicating to us the transport of
    production from their current and future ownership in a defined
    area surrounding the Blind Faith discovery in the deepwater Gulf
    of Mexico. To accommodate production from the Blind Faith
    acreage and the surrounding blocks, we have agreed to extend our
    Canyon Chief and Mountaineer pipelines to the producer-owned
    floating production facility. We expect to have the extensions
    ready for service in the second quarter of 2008. The
    approximately $250 million project will facilitate a

37-mile

extension of each pipeline. The agreement also creates
    opportunities for us to move natural gas from the Blind Faith
    discovery through our Mobile Bay, Alabama, processing plant and
    our Transco and Gulfstream interstate pipeline systems.
    Recovered NGLs from Blind Faith also could be fractionated at
    our facilities in Baton Rouge or Paradis, Louisiana.



Customers
    and operations

Our domestic gas gathering and processing customers are
    generally natural gas producers who have proved

and/or

producing natural gas fields in the areas surrounding our
    infrastructure. During 2007, these operations gathered and
    processed gas for approximately 215 gas gathering and processing
    customers. Our top three gathering and processing customers
    accounted for about 45 percent of our domestic gathering
    and processing revenue. Our gathering and processing agreements
    are generally long-term agreements.

In addition to our gathering and processing operations, we
    market NGLs and petrochemical products to a wide range of users
    in the energy and petrochemical industries. We provide these
    products to third parties from the production at our domestic
    facilities. The majority of domestic sales are based on supply
    contracts of less than one year in duration. The production from
    our Canadian facilities is marketed in Canada and in the United
    States.

Our Venezuelan assets were constructed and are currently
    operated for the exclusive benefit of Petróleos de
    Venezuela S.A under long-term contracts. These significant
    contracts have a remaining term between 10 and 14 years and
    our revenues are based on a combination of fixed capital
    payments, throughput volumes, and, in the case of one of the gas
    compression facilities, a minimum throughput guarantee. The
    Venezuelan government has continued its public criticism of
    U.S. economic and political policy, has implemented
    unilateral changes to existing energy related contracts, and
    continues to publicly declare that additional energy contracts
    will be unilaterally amended and privately held assets will be
    expropriated, escalating our concern regarding political risk in
    Venezuela.

Gas
    Marketing Services

Gas Marketing Services primarily supports our natural gas
    businesses by providing marketing and risk management services,
    which include marketing and hedging the gas produced by
    Exploration & Production, and procuring fuel and
    shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids sales for Midstream.
    In addition, Gas Marketing manages various natural gas-related
    contracts such as transportation, storage, and related hedges,
    and provides services to third-parties, such as producers.

Gas Marketing Services’ natural gas sales volumes,
    including sales volumes to other segments, were 2.3 Bcf/d, 2.1
    Bcf/d and 2.1 Bcf/d for the years ending December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Gas Marketing Services’
    natural gas purchase volumes, including purchases from other
    segments, were 2.4 Bcf/d, 2.3 Bcf/d and 2.2 Bcf/d for the same
    periods.

As of December 31, 2007, Gas Marketing Services has
    approximately 159 customers compared with approximately 163
    customers at the end of 2006.

Our Exploration and Production and Midstream segments may
    execute commodity hedges with Gas Marketing Services. In turn,
    Gas Marketing Services may execute offsetting derivative
    contracts with unrelated third parties.



As a result of the sale of a substantial portion of our Power
    business in the fourth quarter of 2007, Gas Marketing Services
    also is responsible for certain remaining legacy natural gas
    contracts and positions. We intend to liquidate a substantial
    portion of these legacy contracts. During 2007, we substantially
    reduced the overall legacy positions remaining. Until such
    legacy positions are liquidated, segment results may experience
    mark- to-market volatility from commodity-based derivatives that
    represent economic hedges but are not designated as hedges for
    accounting purposes or do not qualify for hedge accounting.
    However, this

mark-to-market

volatility is expected to be significantly reduced compared to
    previous levels.

Other

At December 31, 2007, we owned approximately
    99.3 percent of the Class B Interests in Longhorn
    Partners Pipeline LP (Longhorn), which owned a refined petroleum
    products pipeline from Houston, Texas to El Paso, Texas.
    The Class B Interests are preferred interests but
    subordinate to other preferred interests, and the common
    interests are subordinate to both. It is uncertain whether we
    will ever receive any payments related to our Class B
    Interests or our common interests, however any such amounts
    related to these interests were fully impaired in 2005, and will
    only be recognized as income when received.

We continue to receive payments associated with the 2005
    transfer of the First Amended and Restated Pipeline Operating
    Services Agreement to a third party. The management of Longhorn
    completed an installment sale of the pipeline during the third
    quarter of 2006. The sale of the pipeline did not impact these
    ongoing payments which are recognized as income when received.

Additional
    Business Segment Information

Our ongoing business segments are accounted for as continuing
    operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes to
    financial statements included in Part II.

Operations related to certain assets in “Discontinued
    Operations” have been reclassified from their traditional
    business segment to “Discontinued Operations” in the
    accompanying financial statements and notes to financial
    statements included in Part II.

Our corporate parent company performs certain management, legal,
    financial, tax, consultative, information technology,
    administrative and other services for our subsidiaries.

Our corporate parent company’s principal sources of cash
    are from external financings, dividends and advances from our
    subsidiaries, investments, payments by subsidiaries for services
    rendered, sales of master partnership units to the public,
    interest payments from subsidiaries on cash advances and net
    proceeds from asset sales. The amount of dividends available to
    us from subsidiaries largely depends upon each subsidiary’s
    earnings and operating capital requirements. The terms of
    certain of our subsidiaries’ borrowing arrangements limit
    the transfer of funds to our corporate parent.

We believe that we have adequate sources and availability of raw
    materials and commodities for existing and anticipated business
    needs. In support of our energy commodity activities, primarily
    conducted through Gas Marketing Services, our counterparties
    require us to provide various forms of credit support such as
    margin, adequate assurance amounts and pre-payments for gas
    supplies. Our pipeline systems are all regulated in various ways
    resulting in the financial return on the investments made in the
    systems being limited to standards permitted by the regulatory
    agencies. Each of the pipeline systems has ongoing capital
    requirements for efficiency and mandatory improvements, with
    expansion opportunities also necessitating periodic capital
    outlays.

REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Exploration & Production.

Our
    Exploration & Production business is subject to
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations on
    taxation and payment of royalties, and the development,
    production and marketing of oil and gas, and environmental and
    safety matters. Many laws and regulations require drilling
    permits and govern the spacing of wells, rates of production,
    water discharge, prevention of waste and other matters. Such
    laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning,
    designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning our
    oil



and gas wells and other facilities. In addition, these laws and
    regulations, and any others that are passed by the jurisdictions
    where we have production, could limit the total number of wells
    drilled or the allowable production from successful wells, which
    could limit our reserves.

Gas Pipeline.

Gas Pipeline’s interstate
    transmission and storage activities are subject to FERC
    regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and under the
    Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as such, its rates and
    charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate
    commerce, its accounting, and the extension, enlargement or
    abandonment of its jurisdictional facilities, among other
    things, are subject to regulation. Each gas pipeline company
    holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by
    the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines,
    facilities and properties for which certificates are required
    under the NGA. Each gas pipeline company is also subject to the
    Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which
    regulates safety requirements in the design, construction,
    operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission
    facilities. FERC Standards of Conduct govern how our interstate
    pipelines communicate and do business with their marketing
    affiliates. Among other things, the Standards of Conduct require
    that interstate pipelines not operate their systems to
    preferentially benefit their marketing affiliates.

Each of our interstate natural gas pipeline companies
    establishes its rates primarily through the FERC’s
    ratemaking process. Key determinants in the ratemaking process
    are:

•

costs of providing service, including depreciation expense;

•

allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the
    capital structure and related income taxes;

•

volume throughput assumptions.

The allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate
    design and the allocation of costs between the demand and
    commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these
    proceedings, certain revenues previously collected may be
    subject to refund.

Midstream.

For our Midstream segment, onshore
    gathering is subject to regulation by states in which we operate
    and offshore gathering is subject to the Outer Continental Shelf
    Lands Act (OCSLA). Of the states where Midstream gathers gas,
    currently only Texas actively regulates gathering activities.
    Texas regulates gathering primarily through complaint mechanisms
    under which the state commission may resolve disputes involving
    an individual gathering arrangement. Although gathering
    facilities located offshore are not subject to the NGA (although
    offshore transmission pipelines may be), some controversy exists
    as to how the FERC should determine whether offshore facilities
    function as gathering. These issues are currently before the
    FERC. Most gathering facilities offshore are subject to the
    OCSLA, which provides in part that outer continental shelf
    pipelines “must provide open and nondiscriminatory access
    to both owner and non-owner shippers.”

Midstream also owns interests in and operates two offshore
    transmission pipelines that are regulated by the FERC because
    they are deemed to transport gas in interstate commerce. Black
    Marlin Pipeline Company provides transportation service for
    offshore Texas production in the High Island area and redelivers
    that gas to intrastate pipeline interconnects near Texas City.
    Discovery provides transportation service for offshore Louisiana
    production from the South Timbalier, Grand Isle, Ewing Bank and
    Green Canyon (deepwater) areas to an onshore processing facility
    and downstream interconnect points with major interstate
    pipelines. FERC regulation requires all terms and conditions of
    service, including the rates charged, to be filed with and
    approved by the FERC before any changes can go into effect. In
    2007, Black Marlin filed and settled a major rate change
    application before the FERC resulting in increased rates for
    service. In November 2007, Discovery filed a settlement in lieu
    of a rate change filing that if approved would increase its
    rates for service.

Our remaining Midstream Canadian assets are regulated by the
    Alberta Energy & Utilities Board (AEUB) and Alberta
    Environment. The regulatory system for the Alberta oil and gas
    industry incorporates a large measure of self-regulation,
    providing that licensed operators are held responsible for
    ensuring that their operations are conducted in accordance with
    all provincial regulatory requirements. For situations in which
    non-compliance with the applicable regulations is at issue, the
    AEUB and Alberta Environment have implemented an enforcement
    process with escalating consequences.



Gas Marketing Services.

Our Gas Marketing
    business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations at the
    local, state and federal levels, including the FERC and the
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations. In addition,
    natural gas markets continue to be subject to numerous and
    wide-ranging federal and state regulatory proceedings and
    investigations. We are also subject to various federal and state
    actions and investigations regarding, among other things, market
    structure, behavior of market participants, market prices, and
    reporting to trade publications. We may be liable for refunds
    and other damages and penalties as a result of ongoing actions
    and investigations. The outcome of these matters could affect
    our creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual
    obligations as well as other market participants’
    creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual obligations
    to us.

See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further details on our regulatory matters.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Our generation facilities, processing facilities, natural gas
    pipelines, and exploration and production operations are subject
    to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the
    state and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We could incur liability to
    governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil,
    gas or other pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as
    liability for clean up costs. Materials could be released into
    the environment in several ways including, but not limited to:

•

from a well or drilling equipment at a drill site;

•

leakage from gathering systems, pipelines, transportation
    facilities and storage tanks;

•

damage to oil and gas wells resulting from accidents during
    normal operations;

•

blowouts, cratering and explosions.

Because the requirements imposed by environmental laws and
    regulations are frequently changed, we cannot assure you that
    laws and regulations enacted in the future, including changes to
    existing laws and regulations, will not adversely affect our
    business. In addition we may be liable for environmental damage
    caused by former operators of our properties.

We believe compliance with environmental laws and regulations
    will not have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures,
    earnings or competitive position. However, environmental laws
    and regulations could affect our business in various ways from
    time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance
    expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek
    relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of
    certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance
    expenses.

For a discussion of specific environmental issues, see
    “Environmental” under Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
    “Environmental Matters” in Note 15 of our Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.

COMPETITION

Exploration & Production.

Our
    Exploration & Production segment competes with other
    oil and gas concerns, including major and independent oil and
    gas companies in the development, production and marketing of
    natural gas. We compete in areas such as acquisition of oil and
    gas properties and obtaining necessary equipment, supplies and
    services. We also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled
    employees.

Gas Pipeline.

The natural gas industry has
    undergone significant change over the past two decades. A
    highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and
    increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services,
    including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity,
    have developed. As a result, pipeline capacity is being used
    more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are
    increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity.

Local distribution company (LDC) and electric industry
    restructuring by states have affected pipeline markets. Pipeline
    operators are increasingly challenged to accommodate the
    flexibility demanded by customers and allowed



under tariffs, but the changes implemented at the state level
    have not required renegotiation of LDC contracts. The state
    plans have in some cases discouraged LDCs from signing long-term
    contracts for new capacity.

Several states are considering re-regulation and extending price
    caps because many regulators and legislators believe that
    deregulation has not worked. States are in the process of
    developing new energy plans that may require utilities to
    encourage energy saving measures and diversify their energy
    supplies to include renewable sources. This could lower the
    growth of gas demand.

These factors have increased the risk that customers will reduce
    their contractual commitments for pipeline capacity. Future
    utilization of pipeline capacity will also depend on competition
    from LNG imported into markets and new pipelines from the
    Rockies and other new producing areas, many of which are
    utilizing master limited partnership structures with a lower
    cost of capital, and on growth of natural gas demand.

Midstream.

In our Midstream segment, we face
    regional competition with varying competitive factors in each
    basin. Our gathering and processing business competes with other
    midstream companies, interstate and intrastate pipelines,
    producers and independent gatherers and processors. We primarily
    compete with five to ten companies across all basins in which we
    provide services. Numerous factors impact any given
    customer’s choice of a gathering or processing services
    provider, including rate, location, term, timeliness of services
    to be provided, pressure obligations and contract structure. We
    also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled employees. In
    2005 we formed WPZ to help compete against other master limited
    partnerships for midstream projects. By virtue of the master
    limited partnership structure, WPZ provides us with an
    alternative and low-cost source of capital. We expect the
    alternative, low-cost capital will allow WPZ to compete
    favorably from a cost of capital perspective with other MLPs
    when pursuing acquisition opportunities of gathering and
    processing assets.

Gas Marketing Services.

In our Gas Marketing
    Services segment, we compete directly with large independent
    energy marketers, marketing affiliates of regulated pipelines
    and utilities, and natural gas producers. We also compete with
    brokerage houses, energy hedge funds and other energy-based
    companies offering similar services.

EMPLOYEES

At February 1, 2008, we had approximately
    4,319 full-time employees including 898 at the corporate
    level, 681 at Exploration & Production, 1,732 at Gas
    Pipeline, 984 at Midstream, and 24 at Gas Marketing Services.
    None of our employees are represented by unions or covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.

Risk
    Factors

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS/RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

FOR PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain matters contained in this report include
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
    section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended. These statements discuss our expected future results
    based on current and pending business operations. We make those
    forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor
    protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995.



All statements, other than statements of historical facts,
    included in this report which address activities, events or
    developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or
    may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements.
    Forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of
    words such as “anticipates,” “believes,”
    “could,” “may,” “should,”
    “continues,” “estimates,”
    “expects,” “forecasts,” “might,”
    “planned,” “potential,”
    “projects,” “scheduled” or similar
    expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among
    others, statements regarding:

•

amounts and nature of future capital expenditures;

•

expansion and growth of our business and operations;

•

business strategy;

•

estimates of proved gas and oil reserves;

•

reserve potential;

•

development drilling potential;

•

cash flow from operations or results of operations;

•

seasonality of certain business segments;

•

natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and demand.

Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions,
    uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or
    results to be materially different from those stated or implied
    in this document. Many of the factors that will determine these
    results are beyond our ability to control or project. Specific
    factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in
    the forward-looking statements include:

•

availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent
    in assessing and estimating future natural gas reserves), market
    demand, volatility of prices, and increased costs of capital;

•

inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and
    general economic conditions;

•

the strength and financial resources of our competitors;

•

development of alternative energy sources;

•

the impact of operational and development hazards;

•

costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government
    regulations including proposed climate change legislation,
    environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings;

•

changes in the current geopolitical situation;

•

risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions
    stemming from our debt agreements and future changes in our
    credit ratings;

•

risks associated with future weather conditions;

•

acts of terrorism.

Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
    forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly
    rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any
    obligations to and do not intend to update the above list to
    announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the
    forward-looking statements to reflect future events or
    developments.

In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors
    listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to
    change from those statements of intention set forth in this
    report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our
    results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and
    without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our
    assumptions, or otherwise.



Because forward-looking statements involve risks and
    uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in
    addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to
    differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
    statements. These factors include the following:

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in
    addition to the other information in this report. Each of these
    factors could adversely affect our business, operating results,
    and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of
    an investment in our securities.

Risks
    Inherent to our Industry and Business

The
    long-term financial condition of our natural gas transportation
    and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued
    availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that
    we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets,
    and market demand for natural gas.

The development of the additional natural gas reserves that are
    essential for our gas transportation and midstream businesses to
    thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for
    exploration and development drilling and the installation of
    production, gathering, storage, transportation and other
    facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered
    to our pipeline systems. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory
    limitations, or the lack of available capital for these projects
    could adversely affect the development and production of
    additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline
    transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies,
    adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our
    gathering, transportation and processing facilities.
    Additionally, in some cases, new LNG import facilities built
    near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering
    and transportation facilities.

Estimating
    reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties.
    Negative revisions to reserve estimates and oil and gas price
    declines may lead to decreased earnings, losses or impairment of
    oil and gas assets, including related goodwill.

Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating
    underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured
    in an exact manner. Reserves that are “proved
    reserves” are those estimated quantities of crude oil,
    natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and
    engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered
    as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects.

The process relies on interpretations of available geological,
    geophysical, engineering and production data. There are numerous
    uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved
    reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing
    of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the
    control of the producer. The reserve data included in this
    report represent estimates. In addition, the estimates of future
    net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of
    such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future
    production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be
    correct over time.

Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic
    conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Changes
    to oil and gas prices in the markets for such commodities may
    have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain
    fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable
    reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve
    estimates.

If negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing
    the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the
    affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in
    losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense. The revisions may also be sufficient to trigger
    impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a
    further non-cash charge to earnings. The revisions could also
    possibly affect the evaluation of Exploration &
    Production’s goodwill for impairment purposes.



Our
    past success rate for drilling projects and the historic
    performance of our exploration and production business is no
    predictor of future performance.

Our past success rate for drilling projects in 2007 should not
    be considered a predictor of future performance.

Performance of our exploration and production business is
    affected in part by factors beyond our control (any of which
    could cause the results of this business to decrease
    materially), such as:

•

regulations and regulatory approvals;

•

availability of capital for drilling projects which may be
    affected by other risk factors discussed in this report;

•

cost-effective availability of drilling rigs and necessary
    equipment;

•

availability of skilled labor;

•

availability of cost-effective transportation for products;

•

market risks (including price risks and competition) discussed
    in this report.

Our
    drilling, production, gathering, processing and transporting
    activities involve numerous risks that might result in
    accidents, and other operating risks and hazards.

Our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards
    typically associated with the development and exploration for,
    and the production and transportation of oil and gas. These
    operating risks include, but are not limited to:

•

blowouts, cratering and explosions;

•

uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;

•

fires;

•

formations with abnormal pressures;

•

pollution and other environmental risks;

•

natural disasters.

In addition, there are inherent in our gas gathering, processing
    and transporting properties a variety of hazards and operating
    risks, such as leaks, spills, explosions and mechanical problems
    that could cause substantial financial losses. In addition,
    these risks could result in loss of human life, significant
    damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our
    operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with
    customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some,
    but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we
    believe to be appropriate. The location of certain segments of
    our pipelines in or near populated areas, including residential
    areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could
    increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. In
    spite of our precautions, an event could cause considerable harm
    to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition, particularly if the event is not
    fully covered by insurance. Accidents or other operating risks
    could further result in loss of service available to our
    customers. Such circumstances could materially impact our
    ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers,
    with a resulting impact on our results of operations.

Costs
    of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and
    future environmental regulations could exceed our current
    expectations.

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
    pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and
    municipal laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations
    impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and
    obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use,
    storage, extraction, transportation, treatment and disposal of
    hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills,
    releases and emissions of



various substances into the environment, and in connection with
    the operation, maintenance, abandonment and reclamation of our
    facilities.

Compliance with environmental laws requires significant
    expenditures, including for clean up costs and damages arising
    out of contaminated properties. In addition, the possible
    failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations might
    result in the imposition of fines and penalties. We are
    generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the
    environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether
    acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose
    and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with
    certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be
    required to provide indemnification against, environmental
    liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may
    not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be
    required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance
    could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to
    shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities,
    which might cause us to incur losses. Although we do not expect
    that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
    results of operations, no assurance can be given that the costs
    of complying with environmental laws in the future will not have
    such an effect.

Changes in federal laws or regulations could reduce the
    availability or increase the cost of our interstate pipeline
    capacity or gas supply, and thereby reduce our earnings.
    Congress and certain states have for some time been considering
    various forms of legislation related to greenhouse gas
    emissions. There is a possibility that, when and if enacted, the
    final form of such legislation could increase our costs of
    compliance with environmental laws.

We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible
    expenditures related to environmental conditions based on
    current laws and regulations and current interpretations of
    those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or
    regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our
    assumptions may change. Our regulatory rate structure and our
    contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to
    recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new
    environmental regulations. Also, we might not be able to obtain
    or maintain from time to time all required environmental
    regulatory approvals for certain development projects. If there
    is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory
    approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the
    operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject
    to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse
    consequences to our results of operations.

Our
    operating results for certain segments of our business might
    fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.

Revenues from certain segments of our business can have seasonal
    characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for
    natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a
    result, our overall operating results in the future might
    fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural
    gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our
    expectations depending on the nature and location of our
    facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas
    transportation arrangements relative to demand created by
    unusual weather patterns. Additionally, changes in the price of
    natural gas could benefit one of our business units, but
    disadvantage another. For example, our Exploration &
    Production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices,
    and Midstream, which uses gas as a feedstock, may not.

Risks
    Related to the Current Geopolitical Situation

Our
    investments and projects located outside of the United States
    expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and
    the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates,
    political conditions and policies of foreign governments. These
    risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our
    international projects.

We currently own and might acquire

and/or

dispose of material energy-related investments and projects
    outside the United States. The economic and political conditions
    in certain countries where we have interests or in which we
    might explore development, acquisition or investment
    opportunities present risks of delays in construction and
    interruption of business, as well as risks of war,
    expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions
    or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax
    policy, that are greater than in the United States. The
    uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign
    countries in which we develop or acquire



projects or make investments could make it more difficult to
    obtain non-recourse project financing or other financing on
    suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain
    customers to honor their obligations with respect to such
    projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce
    our rights under agreements relating to such projects or
    investments. Recent events in certain South American countries,
    particularly the continued threat of nationalization of certain
    energy-related assets in Venezuela, could have a material
    negative impact on our results of operations. We may not receive
    adequate compensation, or any compensation, if our assets in
    Venezuela are nationalized.

Operations and investments in foreign countries also can present
    currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and
    repatriation risk. In certain situations under which we develop
    or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary
    conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert
    to U.S. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign
    currencies. In addition, risk from fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or
    borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in
    another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can
    reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service
    obligations. We may or may not put contracts in place designed
    to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. We have some
    exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses
    or volatility in our results of operations.

Risks
    Related to Strategy and Financing

Our
    debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely
    affect our ability to operate our business.

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict
    or limit among other things, our ability to create liens, sell
    assets, make certain distributions, repurchase equity and incur
    additional debt. In addition, our debt agreements contain, and
    those we enter into in the future may contain, financial
    covenants and other limitations with which we will need to
    comply. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be
    affected by many events beyond our control, and we cannot assure
    you that our future operating results will be sufficient to
    comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under
    any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default.

Our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements
    and other related transactional documents could result in events
    of default. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the
    lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a
    particular facility to be immediately due and payable and
    terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. An
    event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement
    could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another
    debt agreement. Such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could
    have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise
    from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If
    an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements
    cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt
    agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt
    outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay
    amounts outstanding under such debt agreements.

A
    downgrade of our current credit ratings could impact our costs
    of doing business in certain ways and maintaining current credit
    ratings is within the control of independent third
    parties.

A downgrade of our credit rating might increase our cost of
    borrowing. Our ability to access capital markets could also be
    limited by a downgrade of our credit rating and other
    disruptions. Such disruptions could include:

•

economic downturns;

•

deteriorating capital market conditions generally;

•

declining market prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and
    other commodities;

•

terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or
    those of other energy companies;

•

the overall health of the energy industry, including the
    bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies.

Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when
    assigning credit ratings. Given the significant changes in
    capital markets and the energy industry over the last few years,
    credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for
    attaining investment grade ratings and make changes to those
    criteria from time to time. Our corporate family credit rating
    and the credit ratings of Transco and Northwest Pipeline were
    raised to investment



grade in 2007 by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s
    Corporation, and Fitch Ratings, Ltd., and our senior unsecured
    debt ratings were raised to investment grade by Moody’s and
    Fitch. No assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies
    will assign us investment grade ratings even if we meet or
    exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios or that our
    senior unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade
    by all of the credit rating agencies.

Prices
    for natural gas liquids, natural gas and other commodities are
    volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our
    financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to
    maintain existing businesses.

Our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the
    value of certain segments of our businesses depend primarily
    upon the prices we receive for natural gas liquids, natural gas,
    or other commodities, and the differences between prices of
    these commodities. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow
    available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow
    money or raise additional capital.

The markets for natural gas liquids, natural gas and other
    commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide
    fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor
    changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities,
    market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our
    control, including:

•

worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas,
    natural gas liquids, petroleum, and related commodities;

•

turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions;

•

the activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
    Countries;

•

terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets;

•

weather conditions;

•

the level of consumer demand;

•

the price and availability of other types of fuels;

•

the availability of pipeline capacity;

•

supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation
    disruptions;

•

the price and level of foreign imports;

•

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;

•

volatility in the natural gas markets;

•

the overall economic environment;

•

the credit of participants in the markets where products are
    bought and sold;

•

the adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate
    change.

We
    might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated
    with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy
    markets.

Our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts consists
    of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including
    contracts for natural gas, natural gas liquids and other
    commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or
    cash throughout the United States. If the values of these
    contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not
    anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our
    results of operations. In the past, certain marketing and
    trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due
    to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. In certain
    instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to
    deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under
    contract. If such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our
    contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of
    amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from,
    counterparties. In addition, in our businesses, we often extend
    credit to our counterparties. Despite performing credit analysis
    prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we
    might not be able to collect amounts



owed to us. If the counterparty to such a transaction fails to
    perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty’s
    obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss.

If we are unable to perform under our energy agreements, we
    could be required to pay damages. These damages generally would
    be based on the difference between the market price to acquire
    replacement energy or energy services and the relevant contract
    price. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy
    markets, such damages could be significant.

Risks
    Related to Regulations that Affect our Industry

Our
    natural gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are
    subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that
    could have an adverse impact on our results of
    operations.

Our interstate natural gas sales, transportation, and storage
    operations conducted through our Gas Pipelines business are
    subject to the FERC’s rules and regulations in accordance
    with the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act
    of 1978. The FERC’s regulatory authority extends to:

•

transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate
    commerce;

•

rates and charges;

•

construction;

•

acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;

•

accounts and records;

•

depreciation and amortization policies;

•

operating terms and conditions of service.

Regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in
    many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues,
    decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and
    otherwise altering the profitability of our business. Regulatory
    decisions could also affect our costs for compression,
    processing and dehydration of natural gas, which could have a
    negative effect on our results of operations.

The FERC has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces
    in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased
    competition throughout the industry. In a number of key markets,
    interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from
    other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution
    companies and end users to choose a transportation provider
    based on considerations other than location.

Competition
    in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our
    results of operations.

We have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses,
    and additional competitors may enter our markets. Other
    companies with which we compete may be able to respond more
    quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or
    to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their facilities than we can. In addition,
    current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions
    or have greater financial resources than we do, which could
    affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. There
    can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully
    against current and future competitors and any failure to do so
    could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and
    results of operations.

Expiration
    of firm transportation agreements.

A substantial portion of the operating revenues of our Gas
    Pipelines are generated through firm transportation agreements
    that expire periodically and must be renegotiated and extended
    or replaced. We cannot give any assurance as to whether any of
    these agreements will be extended or replaced or that the terms
    of any renegotiated agreements will be as favorable as the
    existing agreements. Upon the expiration of these agreements,
    should customers turn back or substantially reduce their
    commitments, we could experience a negative effect to our
    results of operations.



Our
    revenues might decrease if we are unable to gain adequate,
    reliable and affordable access to transportation and
    distribution assets.

We depend on transportation and distribution facilities owned
    and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver
    the commodities we buy and sell in the wholesale market. If
    transportation is disrupted, if capacity is inadequate, or if
    credit requirements or rates of such utilities or energy
    companies are increased, our ability to sell and deliver
    products might be hindered. Further, although there are laws and
    regulations designed to encourage competition in wholesale
    market transactions, some companies may fail to provide fair and
    equal access to their transportation systems or may not provide
    sufficient transportation capacity for other market participants.

Our
    businesses are subject to complex government regulations. The
    operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by
    changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or
    implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations
    applicable to our businesses or our customers.

Existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws
    and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our
    facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and
    regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business.
    Over the past few years, certain restructured energy markets
    have experienced supply problems and price volatility. In some
    of these markets, proposals have been made by governmental
    agencies and other interested parties to re-regulate areas of
    these markets which have previously been deregulated. Various
    forms of market controls and limitations including price caps
    and bid caps have already been implemented and new controls and
    market restructuring proposals are in various stages of
    development, consideration and implementation. We cannot assure
    you that changes in market structure and regulation will not
    adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also
    cannot assure you that other proposals to re-regulate will not
    be made or that legislative or other attention to these
    restructured energy markets will not cause the deregulation
    process to be delayed or reversed or otherwise adversely affect
    our business and results of operations.

The
    outcome of a pending rate case to set the rates we can charge
    customers on Transco’s pipeline might result in rates that
    do not provide an adequate return on the capital we have
    invested in the Transco pipeline.

We have a pending rate case with the FERC to request changes to
    the rates we charge on Transco. We have sought FERC approval of
    a settlement of the significant issues in the rate case but
    until FERC approves the settlement, the outcome of the rate case
    remains uncertain. There is a risk that rates set by the FERC
    will lower our return on the capital we have invested in our
    assets or might not be adequate to recover increases in
    operating costs. There is also the risk that higher rates will
    cause our customers to look for alternative ways to transport
    their natural gas.

Legal
    and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the
    energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our
    business and may continue to do so.

Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the
    capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being
    either proposed or implemented. Such scrutiny has also resulted
    in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in
    which we are a named defendant. Both the shippers on our
    pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we
    charge under certain circumstances. Any successful challenge
    could materially affect our results of operations.

Certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are
    ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a
    whole. We might see these adverse effects continue as a result
    of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings,
    or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state
    regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we
    cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether
    these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings
    against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other
    regulatory action, including legislation, which might be
    materially adverse to the operation of our business and our
    revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other
    ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters against us
    arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including
    environmental matters, disputes over gas measurement, royalty
    payments, shareholder class action suits, regulatory appeals and
    similar matters might result in adverse decisions



against us. The result of such adverse decisions, either
    individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not
    be covered fully or at all by insurance.

Risks
    Related to Accounting Standards

Potential
    changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our
    financial results and disclosures in the future, which might
    change the way analysts measure our business or financial
    performance.

Regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at
    accounting practices, financial disclosures, companies’
    relationships with their independent registered public
    accounting firms, and retirement plan practices. We cannot
    predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting
    regulations or practices in general with respect to public
    companies or the energy industry or in our operations
    specifically.

In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or
    the SEC could enact new accounting standards that might impact
    how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets,
    liabilities and equity.

Risks
    Related to Market Volatility and Risk Measurement and Hedging
    Activities

Our
    risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective
    and could increase the volatility of our results.

Although we have systems in place that use various methodologies
    to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses,
    these systems might not always be followed or might not always
    be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage
    risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse
    changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse
    correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets,
    changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this
    report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and
    balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks
    have been identified.

In an effort to manage our financial exposure related to
    commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into
    contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and
    operations. In these hedging activities, we have used
    fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts,
    futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the
    over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no
    single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks
    present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract
    that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility
    risks would not hedge the contract’s counterparty credit or
    performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue
    to exist. While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk
    within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not
    be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such,
    future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by
    counterparty default.

Our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to
    reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity
    markets could result in increased volatility of our reported
    results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of
    derivatives that qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” (SFAS 133) to the extent that such
    hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the
    value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair
    value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been
    designated as hedges under SFAS 133, must be recorded in
    our income. This creates the risk of volatility in earnings even
    if no economic impact to the Company has occurred during the
    applicable period.

The impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the
    average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the
    level of our hedging strategies. These hedging arrangements may
    limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas
    were to rise substantially over the price established by the
    hedge. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the
    risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including
    instances in which:

•

production is less than expected;

•

the hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating
    the risk being hedged;

•

the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor
    their financial commitments.



Risks
    Related to Employees, Outsourcing of Non-Core Support
    Activities, and Technology

Institutional
    knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement
    eligibility might not be adequately preserved.

In certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge
    resides with employees who have many years of service. As these
    employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace
    them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. In
    addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other
    qualified individuals and our efforts at knowledge transfer
    could be inadequate. If knowledge transfer, recruiting and
    retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts
    of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become
    unavailable to us.

Failure
    of or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might
    negatively impact our ability to conduct our
    business.

Some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing
    relationships. Although we have taken steps to build a
    cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our
    outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance,
    a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services
    performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or
    part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional
    knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be
    able to conduct our business.

Certain of our accounting, information technology, application
    development, and help desk services are currently provided by an
    outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the United
    States. The economic and political conditions in certain
    countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide
    services to us present similar risks of business operations
    located outside of the United States previously discussed,
    including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation,
    nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification
    of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are
    greater than in the United States.

Risks
    Related to Weather, other Natural Phenomena and Business
    Disruption

Our
    assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and
    other natural phenomena.

Our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can
    be adversely affected by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and
    other natural phenomena and weather conditions including extreme
    temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the
    historic rates of return associated with these assets and
    operations.

Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be
    targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business
    or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or
    partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport
    or distribute natural gas, natural gas liquids or other
    commodities. Acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in
    response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause
    environmental repercussions that could result in a significant
    decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or
    remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Properties

We own property in 30 states plus the District of Columbia
    in the United States and in Argentina, Canada and Venezuela.

Gas Marketing’s primary assets are its term contracts,
    related systems and technological support. In our Gas Pipeline
    and Midstream segments, we generally own our facilities,
    although a substantial portion of our pipeline and gathering
    facilities is constructed and maintained pursuant to
    rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or



consents on and across properties owned by others. In our
    Exploration & Production segment, the majority of our
    ownership interest in exploration and production properties is
    held as working interests in oil and gas leaseholds.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

General

We are primarily a natural gas company, engaged in finding,
    producing, gathering, processing, and transporting natural gas.
    Our operations are located principally in the United States and
    are organized into the following reporting segments:
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream
    Gas & Liquids (Midstream), and Gas Marketing Services.
    (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further discussion of reporting segments.)

Unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion of critical
    accounting estimates, discussion and analysis of results of
    operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our
    current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction
    with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
    included in Part II Item 8 of this document.

Overview
    of 2007

Our plan for 2007 was focused on continued disciplined growth.
    Objectives and highlights of this plan included:

Objectives

Highlights

Continuing to improve both
    EVA

®

and segment profit.

2007 segment profit of almost $2.2 billion contributed to
    improving our
    EVA

®

.

Investing in our businesses in a way that improves
    EVA

®

,
    meets customer needs, and enhances our competitive position.

Total capital expenditures were approximately $2.8 billion, of
    which approximately $1.7 billion was invested in Exploration
    & Production.

Continuing to increase natural gas production and reserves in a
    responsible and efficient manner.

Exploration & Production increased its average daily
    domestic production by approximately 21 percent over last
    year while adding 776 billion cubic feet equivalent in net
    reserves during 2007. Total year-end 2007 proved domestic
    natural gas reserves are 4.14 trillion cubic feet equivalent, up
    12 percent from year-end 2006 reserves. Additionally, we
    received 2007 industry awards, including the Bureau of Land
    Management’s Best Management Practice Award.

Increasing the scale of our gathering and processing business in
    key growth basins.

We invested approximately $587 million in capital expenditures
    in Midstream, including Deepwater Gulf expansion projects and
    completion of our Opal gas processing facility expansion.

Successfully resolving rate cases to enable our Gas Pipeline
    segment to create additional value.

Increased rates were effective, subject to refund, on January 1,
    2007, for Northwest Pipeline and on March 1, 2007, for Transco.
    In March, the FERC approved Northwest Pipeline’s new rates.
    In November, Transco filed a stipulation and settlement
    agreement with the FERC, which is subject to final approval.

Our 2007

income from continuing operations

increased to
    $847 million, as compared to $347 million in 2006. Our

net cash provided by operating activities

was
    $2.2 billion in 2007 compared to $1.9 billion in 2006.
    These comparative results reflect:

•

Increased operating income at Midstream due primarily to
    increased natural gas liquid (NGL) margins;



•

Increased operating income at Exploration & Production
    associated with increased production volumes and higher net
    realized average prices;

•

Increased operating income at Gas Pipeline due primarily to new
    rates effective in the first quarter of 2007;

•

The absence of 2006 litigation expense associated with
    shareholder lawsuits and Gulf Liquids litigation.

Natural gas prices in the Rocky Mountain areas (Rockies) trended
    lower throughout 2007 due to strong drilling activities
    increasing third-party supplies while constrained by limited
    pipeline capacity. This trend has benefited Midstream as the
    lower regional gas prices contributed to increased NGL margins
    in the West region. Exploration & Production utilizes
    firm transportation contracts, which allow a substantial portion
    of their Rockies production to be sold at more advantageous
    market points, and basin-level collars and fixed-price hedges to
    reduce exposure to this trend.

See additional discussion in Results of Operations.

Recent
    Events

During third-quarter 2007, we formed Williams Pipeline Partners
    L.P. (WMZ) to own and operate natural gas transportation and
    storage assets. In January 2008, WMZ completed its initial
    public offering of 16.25 million common units at a price of
    $20.00 per unit. In February 2008, the underwriters also
    exercised their right to purchase an additional
    1.65 million common units at the same price. A subsidiary
    of ours serves as the general partner of WMZ. The initial asset
    of the partnership is a 35 percent interest in Northwest
    Pipeline GP, formerly Northwest Pipeline Corporation. Upon
    completion of the transaction, we hold approximately
    47.7 percent of the interests in WMZ, including the
    interests of the general partner.

In December 2007, Williams Partners L.P. acquired certain of our
    membership interests in Wamsutter LLC, the limited liability
    company that owns the Wamsutter system, from us for
    $750 million. Williams Partners L.P. completed the
    transaction after successfully closing a public equity offering
    of 9.25 million common units that yielded net proceeds of
    approximately $335 million. The partnership financed the
    remainder of the purchase price primarily through utilizing
    $250 million of term loan borrowings and issuing
    approximately $157 million of common units to us. Since
    Williams Partners L.P. is consolidated within our consolidated
    financial statements, the debt and equity issued by Williams
    Partners L.P. is reported as a component of our consolidated
    debt balance and minority interest balance, respectively. (See
    Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In December 2007, we repurchased $213 million of
    7.125 percent notes due September 2011 and $22 million
    of 8.125 percent notes due March 2012. In conjunction with
    these early retirements, we paid premiums of approximately
    $19 million. These premiums, as well as related fees and
    expenses are recorded as

early debt retirement costs

in
    the Consolidated Statement of Income.

On November 9, 2007, we closed on the sale of substantially
    all of our power business to Bear Energy, LP, a unit of The Bear
    Stearns Companies, Inc., for $496 million, subject to
    post-closing adjustments. The assets sold included tolling
    contracts, full requirements contracts, tolling resales, heat
    rate options, related hedges and other related assets including
    certain property and software. This sale reduces the risk and
    complexity of our overall business model.

In November 2007, our credit ratings were raised to investment
    grade based on improvements in our credit outlook. As we
    continue to invest and grow our natural gas businesses, our
    improved credit rating is expected to provide greater access to
    capital and more favorable loan terms. See additional discussion
    of credit ratings in

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition

.

On November 28, 2007, Transco filed a formal stipulation
    and agreement with the FERC resolving all substantive issues in
    Transco’s pending 2006 rate case. Final resolution of the
    rate case is subject to approval by the FERC.

In July 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
    of up to $1 billion of our common stock. We intend to
    purchase shares of our stock from time to time in open-market
    transactions or through privately negotiated



or structured transactions at our discretion, subject to market
    conditions and other factors. This stock-repurchase program does
    not have an expiration date. During 2007, we repurchased
    approximately 16 million shares for $526 million at an
    average cost of $33.08 per share. We are funding this program
    with cash on hand.

In April 2007, our Board of Directors approved a regular
    quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, which reflected an
    increase of 11 percent compared to the 9 cents per share
    that we paid in each of the four prior quarters and marked the
    fourth increase in our dividend since late 2004.

On March 30, 2007, the FERC approved the stipulation and
    settlement agreement with respect to the rate case for Northwest
    Pipeline. The settlement establishes an increase in general
    system firm transportation rates on Northwest Pipeline’s
    system from $0.30760 to $0.40984 per Dth (dekatherm), effective
    January 1, 2007.

Outlook
    for 2008

Our plan for 2008 is focused on continued disciplined growth.
    Objectives of this plan include:

•

Continue to improve both
    EVA

®

and segment profit.

•

Invest in our businesses in a way that improves
    EVA

®

,
    meets customer needs, and enhances our competitive position.

•

Continue to increase natural gas production and reserves.

•

Increase the scale of our gathering and processing business in
    key growth basins.

Potential risks

and/or

obstacles that could prevent us from achieving these objectives
    include:

•

Volatility of commodity prices;

•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations;

•

Decreased drilling success at Exploration & Production;

•

Decreased drilling success by third parties served by Midstream
    and Gas Pipeline;

•

Exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and
    litigation issues (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements);

•

General economic and industry downturn.

We continue to address these risks through utilization of
    commodity hedging strategies, focused efforts to resolve
    regulatory issues and litigation claims, disciplined investment
    strategies, and maintaining our desired level of at least
    $1 billion in liquidity from cash and cash equivalents and
    unused revolving credit facilities.

New
    Accounting Standards and Emerging Issues

Accounting standards that have been issued and are not yet
    effective may have an effect on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the future. These include:

•

SFAS No. 141(R) “Business Combinations”
    (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) is effective
    for business combinations with an acquisition date in fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008.

•

SFAS No. 160 “Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (SFAS
    No. 160). SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008.

See

Recent Accounting Standards

in Note 1 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
    these and other recently issued accounting standards.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    therein. We have discussed the



following accounting estimates and assumptions as well as
    related disclosures with our Audit Committee. We believe that
    the nature of these estimates and assumptions is material due to
    the subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility
    of such matters to change, and the impact of these on our
    financial condition or results of operations.

Revenue
    Recognition — Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

We hold a portfolio of energy trading and nontrading contracts.
    We review these contracts to determine whether they are
    nonderivatives or derivatives. If they are derivatives, we
    further assess whether the contracts qualify for either cash
    flow hedge accounting or the normal purchases and normal sales
    exception.

The determination of whether a derivative contract qualifies as
    a cash flow hedge includes an analysis of historical market
    price information to assess whether the derivative is expected
    to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows
    attributed to the hedged risk. We also assess whether the hedged
    forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. This assessment
    requires us to exercise judgment and consider a wide variety of
    factors in addition to our intent, including internal and
    external forecasts, historical experience, changing market and
    business conditions, our financial and operational ability to
    carry out the forecasted transaction, the length of time until
    the forecasted transaction is projected to occur, and the
    quantity of the forecasted transaction. In addition, we compare
    actual cash flows to those that were expected from the
    underlying risk. If a hedged forecasted transaction is not
    probable of occurring, or if the derivative contract is not
    expected to be highly effective, the derivative does not qualify
    for hedge accounting.

For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, we do
    not reflect the effective portion of changes in their fair value
    in earnings until the associated hedged item affects earnings.
    For those that have not been designated as hedges or do not
    qualify for hedge accounting, we recognize the net change in
    their fair value in income currently (marked to market).

For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, we
    prospectively discontinue hedge accounting and recognize future
    changes in fair value directly in earnings if we no longer
    expect the hedge to be highly effective, or if we believe that
    the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of
    occurring. If the forecasted transaction becomes probable of not
    occurring, we reclass amounts previously recorded in other
    comprehensive income into earnings in addition to prospectively
    discontinuing hedge accounting. If the effectiveness of the
    derivative improves and is again expected to be highly effective
    in offsetting cash flows attributed to the hedged risk, or if
    the forecasted transaction again becomes probable, we may
    prospectively re-designate the derivative as a hedge of the
    underlying risk.

Derivatives for which the normal purchases and normal sales
    exception has been elected are accounted for on an accrual
    basis. In determining whether a derivative is eligible for this
    exception, we assess whether the contract provides for the
    purchase or sale of a commodity that will be physically
    delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold over a
    reasonable period in the normal course of business. In making
    this assessment, we consider numerous factors, including the
    quantities provided under the contract in relation to our
    business needs, delivery locations per the contract in relation
    to our operating locations, duration of time between entering
    the contract and delivery, past trends and expected future
    demand, and our past practices and customs with regard to such
    contracts. Additionally, we assess whether it is probable that
    the contract will result in physical delivery of the commodity
    and not net financial settlement.

The fair value of derivative contracts is determined based on
    the nature of the transaction and the market in which
    transactions are executed. We also incorporate assumptions and
    judgments about counterparty performance and credit
    considerations in our determination of their fair value.
    Contracts are executed in the following environments:

•

Organized commodity exchange or over-the-counter markets with
    quoted prices;

•

Organized commodity exchange or over-the-counter markets with
    quoted market prices but limited price transparency, requiring
    increased judgment to determine fair value;

•

Markets without quoted market prices.



The number of transactions executed without quoted market prices
    is limited. We estimate the fair value of these contracts by
    using readily available price quotes in similar markets and
    other market analyses. The fair value of all derivative
    contracts is continually subject to change as the underlying
    commodity market changes and our assumptions and judgments
    change.

Additional discussion of the accounting for energy contracts at
    fair value is included in Energy Trading Activities within
    Item 7 and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Oil-
    and Gas-Producing Activities

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil-
    and gas-producing activities. Estimated natural gas and oil
    reserves and forward market prices for oil and gas are a
    significant part of our financial calculations. Following are
    examples of how these estimates affect financial results:

•

An increase (decrease) in estimated proved oil and gas reserves
    can reduce (increase) our unit-of-production depreciation,
    depletion and amortization rates.

•

Changes in oil and gas reserves and forward market prices both
    impact projected future cash flows from our oil and gas
    properties. This, in turn, can impact our periodic impairment
    analyses, including that for goodwill.

The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very
    complex, requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all
    available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic
    data. After being estimated internally, 99 percent of our
    reserve estimates are either audited or prepared by independent
    experts. (See Part I Item 1 for further discussion.)
    The data may change substantially over time as a result of
    numerous factors, including additional development activity,
    evolving production history, and a continual reassessment of the
    viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a
    result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates could
    occur from time to time. A revision of our reserve estimates
    within reasonably likely parameters is not expected to result in
    an impairment of our oil and gas properties or goodwill.
    However, reserve estimate revisions would impact our
    depreciation and depletion expense prospectively. For example, a
    change of approximately 10 percent in oil and gas reserves
    for each basin would change our annual

depreciation,
    depletion and amortization

expense between approximately
    $33 million and $41 million. The actual impact would
    depend on the specific basins impacted and whether the change
    resulted from proved developed, proved undeveloped or a
    combination of these reserve categories.

Forward market prices, which are utilized in our impairment
    analyses, include estimates of prices for periods that extend
    beyond those with quoted market prices. This forward market
    price information is consistent with that generally used in
    evaluating our drilling decisions and acquisition plans. These
    market prices for future periods impact the production economics
    underlying oil and gas reserve estimates. The prices of natural
    gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period, thus
    impacting our estimates. An unfavorable change in the forward
    price curve within reasonably likely parameters is not expected
    to result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties or
    goodwill.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies,
    including environmental matters, when we assess that a loss is
    probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
    Revisions to contingent liabilities are generally reflected in
    income in the period in which new or different facts or
    information become known or circumstances change that affect the
    previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of
    loss. Liabilities for contingent losses are based upon our
    assumptions and estimates and upon advice of legal counsel,
    engineers, or other third parties regarding the probable
    outcomes of the matter. As new developments occur or more
    information becomes available, our assumptions and estimates of
    these liabilities may change. Changes in our assumptions and
    estimates or outcomes different from our current assumptions and
    estimates could materially affect future results of operations
    for any particular quarterly or annual period. See Note 15
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Valuation
    of Deferred Tax Assets and Tax Contingencies

We have deferred tax assets resulting from certain investments
    and businesses that have a tax basis in excess of the book basis
    and from tax carry-forwards generated in the current and prior
    years. We must evaluate whether we will ultimately realize these
    tax benefits and establish a valuation allowance for those that
    may not be realizable. This evaluation considers tax planning
    strategies, including assumptions about the availability and
    character of future taxable income. At December 31, 2007,
    we have $717 million of deferred tax assets for which a
    $57 million valuation allowance has been established. When
    assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we considered
    forecasts of future company performance, the estimated impact of
    potential asset dispositions and our ability and intent to
    execute tax planning strategies to utilize tax carryovers. We do
    not expect to be able to utilize $57 million of foreign
    deferred tax assets primarily related to carryovers. The
    ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be
    materially different from those recorded, as influenced by
    potential changes in jurisdictional income tax laws and the
    circumstances surrounding the actual realization of related tax
    assets.

We regularly face challenges from domestic and foreign tax
    authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges
    include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions
    and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
    Beginning January 1, 2007, we evaluate the liability
    associated with our various filing positions by applying the two
    step process of recognition and measurement as required by
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
    an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (FIN 48). The ultimate disposition of these contingencies
    could have a significant impact on net cash flows. To the extent
    we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been
    established or were required to pay amounts in excess of our
    accrued liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial
    statement period may be materially impacted.

See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information regarding FIN 48 and tax
    carryovers.

Pension
    and Postretirement Obligations

We have employee benefit plans that include pension and other
    postretirement benefits. Net periodic benefit expense and
    obligations are impacted by various estimates and assumptions.
    These estimates and assumptions include the expected long-term
    rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, expected rate of
    compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, and
    employee demographics, including retirement age and mortality.
    These assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made
    as needed. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and the
    benefit obligations are shown in Note 7 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table presents
    the estimated increase (decrease) in net periodic benefit
    expense and obligations resulting from a one-percentage-point
    change in the specified assumption.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are
    determined by combining a review of historical returns realized
    within the portfolio, the investment strategy included in the
    plans’ Investment Policy Statement, and capital market
    projections for the asset classifications in which the portfolio
    is invested as well as the target



weightings of each asset classification. These rates are
    impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because
    they are long-term in nature, short-term market swings do not
    significantly impact the rates. Changes to our target asset
    allocation would also impact these rates. Our expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets used for our pension plans is
    7.75 percent for 2007. This rate was 7.75 percent in
    2006 and 8.5 percent from

2002-2005.

Over the past ten years, our actual average return on plan
    assets for our pension plans has been approximately
    7.7 percent.

The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations
    of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The
    objective of the discount rates is to determine the amount, if
    invested at the December 31 measurement date in a portfolio of
    high-quality debt securities, that will provide the necessary
    cash flows when benefit payments are due. Increases in the
    discount rates decrease the obligation and, generally, decrease
    the related expense. The discount rates for our pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans were determined separately
    based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective
    expected benefit cash flows as described in Note 7 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our discount rate
    assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and
    market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term
    high-quality debt securities as well as the duration of our
    plans’ liabilities.

The expected rate of compensation increase represents average
    long-term salary increases. An increase in this rate causes
    pension obligation and expense to increase.

The assumed health care cost trend rates are based on our actual
    historical cost rates that are adjusted for expected changes in
    the health care industry. An increase in this rate causes other
    postretirement benefit obligation and expense to increase.

2007 vs.

The increase in

revenues

is due primarily to higher
    Midstream revenues associated with increased natural gas liquid
    (NGL) and olefins marketing revenues and increased production of
    olefins and NGLs. Exploration & Production experienced
    higher revenues also due to increases in production volumes and
    net realized average prices. Additionally, Gas Pipeline revenues
    increased primarily due to increased rates in effect since the
    first quarter of 2007. These increases are partially offset by a
    mark-to-market loss recognized at Gas Marketing Services on a
    legacy derivative natural gas sales contract that we expect to
    assign to another party in 2008 under an asset transfer
    agreement that we executed in December 2007.



The increase in

costs and operating expenses

is due
    primarily to increased NGL and olefins marketing purchases and
    increased costs associated with our olefins production business
    at Midstream. Additionally, Exploration & Production
    experienced higher depreciation, depletion and amortization and
    lease operating expenses due primarily to higher production
    volumes.

The increase in

selling, general and administrative expenses
    (SG&A)

is primarily due to increased staffing in
    support of increased drilling and operational activity at
    Exploration & Production, the absence of a
    $25 million gain in 2006 related to the sale of certain
    receivables at Gas Marketing Services, and a $9 million
    charge related to certain international receivables at Midstream.

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income

in 2007 includes:

•

Income of $18 million associated with payments received for
    a terminated firm transportation agreement on Northwest
    Pipeline’s Grays Harbor lateral;

•

Income of $17 million associated with a change in estimate
    related to a regulatory liability at Northwest Pipeline;

•

Income of $12 million related to a favorable litigation
    outcome at Midstream;

•

Income of $8 million due to the reversal of a planned major
    maintenance accrual at Midstream;

•

Expense of $20 million related to an accrual for litigation
    contingencies at Gas Marketing Services;

•

Expense of $10 million related to an impairment of the
    Carbonate Trend pipeline at Midstream.

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income

in 2006 includes:

•

A $73 million accrual for a Gulf Liquids litigation
    contingency;

•

Income of $9 million due to a settlement of an
    international contract dispute at Midstream.

The increase in

general corporate expenses

is
    attributable to various factors, including higher
    employee-related costs, increased levels of charitable
    contributions and information technology expenses. The higher
    employee-related costs are primarily the result of higher stock
    compensation expense. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

The

securities litigation settlement and related costs

is
    primarily the result of our 2006 settlement related to

class-action

securities litigation filed on behalf of purchasers of our
    securities between July 24, 2000 and July 22, 2002.
    (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The increase in

operating income

reflects record high NGL
    margins at Midstream, continued strong natural gas production
    growth at Exploration & Production, the positive
    effect of new rates at Gas Pipeline, and the absence of 2006
    litigation expenses associated with shareholder lawsuits and
    Gulf Liquids litigation.

Interest accrued — net

includes a decrease of
    $19 million in interest expense associated with our Gulf
    Liquids litigation contingency, offset by changes in our debt
    portfolio, most significantly the issuance of new debt in
    December 2006 by Williams Partners L.P.

The increase in

investing income

is due to:

•

An approximate $27 million increase in interest income
    primarily associated with larger cash and cash equivalent
    balances combined with slightly higher rates of return in 2007
    compared to 2006;

•

Increased equity earnings of $38 million due largely to
    increased earnings of our Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C.
    (Gulfstream), Discovery Producer Services LLC (Discovery) and
    Aux Sable Liquid Products, L.P. (Aux Sable) investments;

•

The absence of a $16 million impairment in 2006 of a
    Venezuelan cost-based investment at Exploration &
    Production;

•

Approximately $14 million of gains from sales of cost-based
    investments in 2007.



These increases are partially offset by the absence of an
    approximately $7 million gain on the sale of an
    international investment in 2006.

Early debt retirement costs

in 2007 includes
    $19 million of premiums and fees related to the December
    2007 repurchase of senior unsecured notes. (See Note 11 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Early debt
    retirement costs

in 2006 includes $27 million in
    premiums and fees related to the January 2006 debt conversion
    and $4 million of accelerated amortization of debt expenses
    related to the retirement of the debt secured by assets of
    Williams Production RMT Company.

Minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries

increased primarily due to the growth in the minority
    interest holdings of Williams Partners L.P.

Provision for income taxes

was significantly higher in
    2007 due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings. The effective
    income tax rate for 2007 is slightly higher than the federal
    statutory rate primarily due to the effect of taxes on foreign
    operations and an accrual for income tax contingencies,
    partially offset by the utilization of charitable contribution
    carryovers not previously benefited. The effective income tax
    rate for 2006 is slightly higher than the federal statutory rate
    primarily due to state income taxes, the effect of taxes on
    foreign operations, nondeductible convertible debenture expenses
    and an accrual for income tax contingencies, partially offset by
    the favorable resolution of federal income tax litigation and
    the utilization of charitable contribution carryovers not
    previously benefited. The 2006 effective income tax rate has
    been increased by an adjustment to increase overall deferred
    income tax liabilities. (See Note 5 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Income (loss) from discontinued operations

in 2007
    primarily includes the operating results of substantially all of
    our power business and the sale of that business, which was
    completed in November 2007. (See Note 2 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.) These results include the
    following pre-tax items:

•

A $429 million gain associated with the reclassification of
    deferred net hedge gains from

accumulated other comprehensive
    income,

partially offset by unrealized mark-to-market losses
    of approximately $23 million;

•

A $111 million impairment charge related to the carrying
    value of certain derivative contracts for which we had
    previously elected the normal purchases and normal sales
    exception under SFAS 133 and, accordingly, were no longer
    recording at fair value;

•

A $37 million loss on the sale of substantially all of our
    power business;

•

A $14 million impairment charge for our Hazelton power
    generation facility.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations

in 2006
    includes:

•

A $14 million net-of-tax loss related to our discontinued
    power business (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements);

•

A $12 million net-of-tax litigation settlement related to
    our former chemical fertilizer business;

•

A $4 million net-of-tax charge associated with the
    settlement of a loss contingency related to a former exploration
    business;

•

A $9 million net-of-tax charge associated with an oil
    purchase contract related to our former Alaska refinery.

2006 vs.

The decrease in

revenues

is primarily due to lower
    natural gas realized revenues at Gas Marketing Services
    associated with lower natural gas sales prices. Additionally,
    the effect of a change in forward prices on legacy natural gas
    derivative contracts not designated as cash flow hedges had an
    unfavorable impact on revenues. Partially



offsetting these decreases are increased crude, olefin and NGL
    marketing revenues, higher NGL production revenue at Midstream
    and increased production revenue at Exploration &
    Production.

The decrease in

costs and operating expenses

is largely
    due to reduced natural gas purchase prices at Gas Marketing
    Services. Partially offsetting these decreases are increased
    crude, olefin and NGL marketing purchases and operating expenses
    at Midstream and increased depreciation, depletion and
    amortization and lease operating expense at
    Exploration & Production.

The increase in

SG&A expenses

is primarily due to
    increased personnel costs, insurance expense, higher information
    systems support costs and the absence of a $17 million
    reduction of pension expense at Gas Pipeline in 2005.
    Additionally, Exploration & Production experienced
    higher costs due to increased staffing in support of increased
    drilling and operational activity.

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income

in 2005 includes:

•

An $82 million accrual for litigation contingencies at Gas
    Marketing Services, associated primarily with agreements reached
    to substantially resolve exposure related to certain natural gas
    price and volume reporting issues;

•

Gains totaling $30 million on the sale of certain natural
    gas properties at Exploration & Production;

•

A gain of $9 million on a sale of land in our Other segment.

General corporate expenses

decreased primarily due to the
    absence of $14 million of insurance settlement charges in
    2005 associated with certain insurance coverage allocation
    issues.

The decrease in

operating income

primarily reflects the
    negative effect of a change in forward prices on natural gas
    derivative contracts at Gas Marketing Services, higher operating
    and administrative costs at Gas Pipeline and 2006 litigation
    expenses associated with shareholder lawsuits and Gulf Liquids
    litigation. These decreases are partially offset by higher
    margins at Midstream and the absence a 2005 accrual for
    estimated litigation contingencies associated primarily with
    agreements reached to substantially resolve exposure related to
    natural gas price and volume reporting issues.

Interest accrued — net

in 2006 includes
    $22 million in interest expense associated with our Gulf
    Liquids litigation contingency.

The increase in

investing income

is due to:

•

The absence of an $87 million impairment in 2005 on our
    investment in Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn);

•

The absence of a $23 million impairment in 2005 of our Aux
    Sable equity investment;

•

An approximate $30 million increase in interest income
    primarily associated with increased earnings on cash and cash
    equivalent balances associated with higher rates of return;

•

Increased equity earnings of $33 million due largely to the
    absence of equity losses in 2006 on Longhorn and increased
    earnings of our Discovery and Aux Sable investments.

These increases are partially offset by:

•

A $16 million impairment of a Venezuelan cost-based
    investment at Exploration & Production in 2006;

•

The absence of a $9 million gain on sale of our remaining

Mid-America

Pipeline (MAPL) and Seminole Pipeline (Seminole) investments at
    Midstream in 2005.

The increase in

minority interest in income of consolidated
    subsidiaries

is primarily due to the growth of Williams
    Partners L.P.



Provision for income taxes

was significantly lower in
    2006 due primarily to lower pre-tax earnings. The effective
    income tax rate for 2006 is slightly higher than the federal
    statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, the effect
    of taxes on foreign operations, nondeductible convertible
    debenture expenses and an accrual for income tax contingencies,
    partially offset by the favorable resolution of federal income
    tax litigation and the utilization of charitable contribution
    carryovers not previously benefited. The 2006 effective income
    tax rate has been increased by an adjustment to increase overall
    deferred income tax liabilities. The effective income tax rate
    for 2005 is higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily
    to state income taxes, nondeductible expenses and the inability
    to utilize charitable contribution carryovers. The 2005
    effective income tax rate was reduced by an adjustment to reduce
    overall deferred income tax liabilities and favorable
    settlements on federal and state income tax matters. (See
    Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Income (loss) from discontinued operations

in 2005
    includes a $155 million net-of-tax loss related to our
    discontinued power business. (See Note 2 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

in
    2005 is due to the implementation of FIN 47.



Results
    of Operations — Segments

We are currently organized into the following segments:
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream, Gas
    Marketing Services, and Other. Other primarily consists of
    corporate operations. Our management currently evaluates
    performance based on segment profit (loss) from operations. (See
    Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Exploration &
    Production

Overview
    of 2007

In 2007, we continued our strategy of a rapid execution of our
    development drilling program in our growth basins. Accordingly,
    we:

•

Increased average daily domestic production levels by
    approximately 21 percent compared to last year. The average
    daily domestic production was approximately 913 million
    cubic feet of gas equivalent (MMcfe) in 2007 compared to
    752 MMcfe in 2006. The increased production is primarily
    due to increased development within the Piceance, Powder River,
    and Fort Worth basins.

2007 vs
    2006 Domestic Production

Average
    daily domestic production grew 21 percent or 161 MMcfe per
    day

•

Benefited from increased domestic net realized average prices,
    which increased by approximately 15 percent compared to
    last year. The domestic net realized average price was $5.08 per
    thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent (Mcfe) in 2007 compared to
    $4.40 per Mcfe in 2006. Net realized average prices include
    market prices, net of fuel and shrink and hedge positions, less
    gathering and transportation expenses.

•

Utilized firm transportation contracts which allowed a
    substantial portion of our Rockies production to be sold at more
    advantageous market points outside of the Rocky Mountain
    markets. Basin-level collars and fixed-price hedges also reduced
    our exposure to natural gas prices in the Rockies.

•

Continued our aggressive development drilling program, drilling
    1,590 gross wells in 2007 with a success rate of over
    99 percent. This contributed to total net additions of
    776 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) in net
    reserves — a replacement rate for our domestic
    production of 232 percent in 2007 compared to
    216 percent in 2006. Capital expenditures for domestic
    drilling, development, and acquisition activity in 2007 were
    approximately $1.7 billion compared to approximately
    $1.4 billion in 2006.



The benefits of higher production volumes and higher net
    realized average prices were partially offset by increased
    operating costs. The increase in operating costs was primarily
    due to increased production volumes and higher well service and
    industry costs. In addition, higher production volumes increased
    depletion, depreciation and amortization expense.

Significant
    events

In February 2007, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks in order to reduce margin
    requirements related to our hedging activities as well as lower
    transaction fees. Margin requirements, if any, under this new
    facility are dependent on the level of hedging and on natural
    gas reserves value. (See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.) We may also execute hedges with the Gas
    Marketing Services segment, which, in turn, executes offsetting
    derivative contracts with unrelated third parties. In this
    situation, Gas Marketing Services, generally, bears the
    counterparty performance risks associated with unrelated third
    parties. Hedging decisions primarily are made considering our
    overall commodity risk exposure and are not executed
    independently by Exploration & Production.

In May and July 2007, we increased our position in the
    Fort Worth basin by acquiring producing properties and
    leasehold acreage for approximately $41 million. These
    acquisitions are consistent with our growth strategy of
    leveraging our horizontal drilling expertise by acquiring and
    developing low-risk properties in the Barnett Shale formation.
    In July 2007, we increased our position in the Piceance basin by
    acquiring additional undeveloped leasehold acreage for
    approximately $36 million.

Outlook
    for 2008

Our expectations and objectives for 2008 include:

•

Maintaining our development drilling program in our key basins
    of Piceance, Powder River, San Juan, Arkoma, and
    Fort Worth through our planned capital expenditures
    projected between $1.45 billion and $1.65 billion.

•

Continuing to grow our average daily domestic production level
    with a goal of approximately 10 to 15 percent annual growth.

Natural gas prices in the Rocky Mountain areas trended lower
    throughout 2007 due to strong drilling activities increasing
    supplies while constrained by limited pipeline capacity.
    However, we will continue to utilize firm transportation
    contracts which allow a substantial portion of our Rockies
    production to be sold at more advantageous market points. Our
    continued use of basin-level collars and fixed-price hedges
    should also reduce our exposure to this trend. The construction
    of a new third-party pipeline that began transporting gas from
    the Rocky Mountain areas in the beginning of 2008 should lessen
    pipeline transportation capacity constraints and provided an
    additional alternative market for the sale of production.

Approximately 70 MMcf of our forecasted 2008 daily domestic
    production is hedged by NYMEX and basis fixed-price contracts at
    prices that average $3.97 per Mcf at a basin level. In addition,
    we have the following collar agreements for our forecasted 2008
    daily domestic production, shown at basin-level weighted-average
    prices and weighted-average volumes:

Risks to achieving our expectations include unfavorable natural
    gas market price movements which are impacted by numerous
    factors including weather conditions and domestic natural gas
    production and consumption. Also, achievement of expectations
    can be affected by costs of services associated with drilling.



In January 2008, we sold a contractual right to a production
    payment on certain future international hydrocarbon production
    for approximately $148 million. We have received
    $118 million in cash and $29 million has been placed
    in escrow subject to certain post-closing conditions and
    adjustments. We will recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately
    $118 million in the first quarter of 2008 related to the
    initial cash received. As a result of the contract termination,
    we have no further interests associated with the crude oil
    concession, which is located in Peru. We had obtained these
    interests through our acquisition of Barrett Resources
    Corporation in 2001.

$487 million, or 39 percent, increase in domestic
    production revenues reflecting $264 million associated with
    a 21 percent increase in production volumes sold and
    $223 million associated with a 15 percent increase in
    net realized average prices. The increase in production volumes
    reflects an increase in the number of producing wells primarily
    from the Piceance and Powder River basins. The impact of hedge
    positions on increased net realized average prices includes both
    the expiration of a portion of fixed-price hedges that are lower
    than the current market prices and higher than current market
    prices related to basin-specific collars entered into during the
    period. Production revenues in 2007 include approximately
    $53 million related to natural gas liquids. In 2006,
    approximately $29 million of similar revenues were
    classified within other revenues;

•

$139 million increase in revenues for gas management
    activities related to gas sold on behalf of certain outside
    parties which is offset by a similar increase in

segment
    costs and expenses

;

These increases were partially offset by a $30 million
    decrease relating to hedge ineffectiveness. In 2006, there were
    $14 million in net unrealized gains from hedge
    ineffectiveness as compared to $16 million in net
    unrealized losses in 2007.

To manage the commodity price risk and volatility of owning
    producing gas properties, we enter into derivative forward sales
    contracts that fix the sales price relating to a portion of our
    future production. Approximately 19 percent of domestic
    production in 2007 was hedged by NYMEX and basis fixed-price
    contracts at a weighted-average price of $3.90 per Mcf at a
    basin level compared to 40 percent hedged at a
    weighted-average price of $3.82 per Mcf for 2006. Also,
    approximately 30 percent and 15 percent of 2007 and
    2006 domestic production was



hedged in the following collar agreements shown at basin-level

Total

segment costs and expenses

increased
    $404 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$173 million higher depreciation, depletion and
    amortization expense primarily due to higher production volumes
    and increased capitalized drilling costs;

•

$139 million increase in expenses for gas management
    activities related to gas purchased on behalf of certain outside
    parties which is offset by a similar increase in

segment
    revenues

;

•

$46 million higher lease operating expenses from the
    increased number of producing wells primarily within the
    Piceance, Powder River, and Fort Worth basins in
    combination with higher well service expenses, facility
    expenses, equipment rentals, maintenance and repair services,
    and salt water disposal expenses;

•

$36 million higher

SG&A expenses

primarily due
    to increased staffing in support of increased drilling and
    operational activity, including higher compensation. In
    addition, we incurred higher insurance and information
    technology support costs related to the increased activity.
    First quarter 2007 also includes approximately $5 million
    of expenses associated with a correction of costs incorrectly
    capitalized in prior periods.

The $204 million increase in s

egment profit

is
    primarily due to the 21 percent increase in domestic
    production volumes sold as well as the 15 percent increase
    in net realized average prices, partially offset by the increase
    in

segment costs and expenses

.

2006 vs.

Total

segment revenues

increased $219 million, or
    17 percent, primarily due to the following:

•

$165 million, or 15 percent, increase in domestic
    production revenues reflecting $245 million primarily
    associated with a 23 percent increase in natural gas
    production volumes sold, offset by a decrease of
    $80 million associated with a 6 percent decrease in
    net realized average prices. The increase in production volumes
    is primarily from the Piceance and Powder River basins and the
    decrease in prices reflects the downward trending of market
    prices in the latter part of 2006.

•

$10 million increase in production revenues from our
    international operations primarily due to increases in net
    realized average prices for crude oil production volumes sold.

•

$14 million of net unrealized gains in 2006 from hedge
    ineffectiveness and forward mark-to-market gains on certain
    basis swaps not designated as hedges as compared to
    $10 million in net unrealized losses attributable to hedge
    ineffectiveness from NYMEX collars in 2005.

In 2005, approximately 47 percent of domestic production
    was hedged by NYMEX and basis fixed-price contracts at a
    weighted-average price of $3.99 per Mcf. Approximately
    10 percent of domestic production was hedged by a NYMEX
    collar agreement for approximately 50 MMcf per day at a
    floor price of $7.50 per Mcf and a



ceiling price of $10.49 per Mcf in the first quarter and at a
    floor price of $6.75 per Mcf and a ceiling price of $8.50 per
    Mcf in the second, third, and fourth quarters, and a Northwest
    Pipeline/Rockies collar agreement for approximately 50 MMcf
    per day in the fourth quarter at a floor price of $6.10 per Mcf
    and a ceiling price of $7.70 per Mcf.

Total

segment costs and expenses

increased
    $257 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$107 million higher depreciation, depletion and
    amortization expense primarily due to higher production volumes
    and increased capitalized drilling costs;

•

$54 million higher lease operating expense primarily due to
    the increased number of producing wells and higher well service
    and industry costs due to increased demand and approximately
    $6 million for out-of-period expenses related to 2005;

•

$33 million higher selling, general and administrative
    expenses primarily due to higher compensation for additional
    staffing in support of increased drilling and operational
    activity. In addition, we incurred higher legal, insurance, and
    information technology support costs related to the increased
    activity;

•

$19 million higher operating taxes primarily due to higher
    production volumes sold and increased tax rates;

•

The absence in 2006 of $30 million of gains on the sales of
    properties in 2005.

The $35 million decrease in

segment profit

is
    primarily due to lower net realized average prices and higher

segment costs and expenses

as discussed previously, and
    the absence in 2006 of $30 million of gains on the sales of
    properties in 2005. Partially offsetting these decreases are a
    23 percent increase in domestic production volumes sold and
    increase in income from ineffectiveness and forward
    mark-to-market gains.

Segment profit

also includes an
    $8 million increase in our international operations
    primarily due to higher revenue and equity earnings as a result
    of increases in net realized average prices for crude oil
    production volumes sold.

Gas
    Pipeline

Overview

Our strategy to create value for our shareholders focuses on
    maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing
    high quality, low cost transportation of natural gas to large
    and growing markets.

Gas Pipeline’s interstate transmission and storage
    activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such,
    our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in
    interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment
    of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things,
    are subject to regulation. The rates are established through the
    FERC’s ratemaking process. Changes in commodity prices and
    volumes transported have little impact on revenues because the
    majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity
    reservation charges in transportation rates.

Significant events of 2007 include:

Gas
    Pipeline master limited partnership

During third-quarter 2007, we formed Williams Pipeline Partners
    L.P. (WMZ) to own and operate natural gas transportation and
    storage assets. In January 2008, WMZ completed its initial
    public offering of 16.25 million common units at a price of
    $20.00 per unit. In February 2008, the underwriters also
    exercised their right to purchase an additional
    1.65 million common units at the same price. A subsidiary
    of ours serves as the general partner of WMZ. The initial asset
    of the partnership is a 35 percent interest in Northwest
    Pipeline GP, formerly Northwest Pipeline Corporation. Upon
    completion of the transaction, we hold approximately
    47.7 percent of the interests in WMZ, including the
    interests of the general partner.



Status of
    rate cases

During 2006, Northwest Pipeline and Transco each filed general
    rate cases with the FERC for increases in rates. The new rates
    were effective, subject to refund, on January 1, 2007, for
    Northwest Pipeline and on March 1, 2007, for Transco.

On March 30, 2007, the FERC approved the stipulation and
    settlement agreement with respect to the rate case for Northwest
    Pipeline. The settlement establishes an increase in general
    system firm transportation rates on Northwest Pipeline’s
    system from $0.30760 to $0.40984 per Dth (dekatherm), effective
    January 1, 2007.

On November 28, 2007, Transco filed a formal stipulation
    and agreement with the FERC resolving all substantive issues in
    Transco’s pending 2006 rate case. Final resolution of the
    rate case is subject to approval by the FERC.

Parachute
    Lateral project

In May 2007, we placed into service a 37.6-mile expansion of

30-inch

diameter line in northwest Colorado. The expansion increased
    capacity by 450 Mdt/d at a cost of approximately
    $86 million. In December 2007, this asset was purchased by
    Midstream. In an arrangement approved by the FERC, Midstream
    will lease the pipeline to Gas Pipeline, who will continue to
    operate the pipeline until completion of a planned FERC
    abandonment filing.

Leidy to
    Long Island expansion project

In December 2007, we placed into service an expansion of certain
    existing pipeline facilities in the northeast United States. The
    project increased firm transportation capacity by 100 Mdt/d at
    an approximate cost of $169 million.

Potomac
    expansion project

In November 2007, we placed into service 16.5 miles of

42-inch

pipeline in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The
    second phase of the project involving installation of certain
    facilities will be completed in the fall of 2008. The project
    provides 165 Mdt/d of incremental firm capacity at an
    approximate total cost of $88 million.

Outlook
    for 2008

Gulfstream

In June 2007, our equity method investee, Gulfstream, received
    FERC approval to extend its existing pipeline approximately
    34 miles within Florida. The extension will fully subscribe
    the remaining 345 Mdt/d of firm capacity on the existing
    pipeline. Construction began in January 2008. The estimated cost
    of this project is approximately $130 million and is
    expected to be placed into service in July 2008.

In September 2007, Gulfstream received FERC approval to
    construct 17.5 miles of

20-inch

pipeline and to install a new compressor facility. Construction
    began in December 2007. The pipeline expansion will increase
    capacity by 155 Mdt/d and is expected to be placed into service
    in September 2008. The compressor facility is expected to be
    placed into service in January 2009. The estimated cost of this
    project is approximately $153 million.

Sentinel
    expansion project

In December 2007, we filed an application with the FERC to
    construct an expansion in the northeast United States. The
    estimated cost of the project is approximately
    $169 million. The expansion will increase capacity by 142
    Mdt/d and is expected to be placed into service in two phases,
    occurring in November 2008 and November 2009.

Jackson
    Prairie expansion project

We own a one-third interest in the Jackson Prairie underground
    storage facility located in Washington, with the remaining
    interests owned by two of our distribution customers. In
    February 2007, we received FERC approval to



expand the Jackson Prairie facility. The expansion will increase
    our one-third share of the capacity by 104 Mdt/d and is expected
    to be placed into service in November 2008.

2007 vs.

Revenues

increased $262 million, or 19 percent,
    due primarily to a $173 million increase in transportation
    revenue and a $25 million increase in storage revenue
    resulting primarily from new rates effective in the first
    quarter of 2007. In addition, revenues increased
    $59 million due to the sale of excess inventory gas.

Costs and operating expenses

increased $86 million,
    or 11 percent, due primarily to:

•

An increase of $59 million associated with the sale of
    excess inventory gas, which includes a $19 million deferred
    gain, half of which will be payable to customers, pending FERC
    approval;

•

An increase in depreciation expense of $30 million due to
    property additions;

•

An increase in personnel costs of $10 million due primarily
    to higher compensation as well as an increase in number of
    employees;

•

The absence of a $3 million credit to expense recorded in
    2006 related to corrections of the carrying value of certain
    liabilities.

Partially offsetting these increases is a decrease of
    $12 million in contract and outside service costs and a
    decrease of $7 million in materials and supplies expense.

Other (income) expense — net

changed favorably
    by $15 million due primarily to $18 million of income
    associated with payments received for a terminated firm
    transportation agreement on Northwest Pipeline’s Grays
    Harbor lateral. Also included in the favorable change is
    $17 million of income recorded in the second quarter of
    2007 for a change in estimate related to a regulatory liability
    at Northwest Pipeline, partially offset by $18 million of
    expense related to higher asset retirement obligations.

Equity earnings increased $14 million due primarily to a
    $14 million increase in equity earnings from Gulfstream.
    Gulfstream’s higher earnings were primarily due to a
    decrease in property taxes from a favorable litigation outcome
    as well as improved operating results.

The $206 million, or 44 percent, increase in

segment profit

is due primarily to $262 million
    higher revenues, $14 million higher equity earnings and
    $15 million favorable

other (income) expense —
    net

as previously discussed. Partially offsetting these
    increases are higher

costs and operating expenses

as
    previously discussed.

2006 vs.

Significant
    2005 adjustments

Operating results for 2005 included:

•

Adjustments of $18 million reflected as a $12 million
    reduction of

costs and operating expenses

and a
    $6 million reduction of

SG&A expenses

. These
    cost reductions were corrections of the carrying value of
    certain liabilities that were recorded in prior periods. Based
    on a review by management, these liabilities were no longer
    required.

•

Pension expense reduction of $17 million in the second
    quarter of 2005 to reflect the cumulative impact of a correction
    of an error attributable to 2003 and 2004. The error was
    associated with the actuarial



computation of annual net periodic pension expense and resulted
    from the identification of errors in certain Transco participant
    data involving annuity contract information utilized for 2003
    and 2004.

•

Adjustments of $37 million reflected as increases in

costs and operating expenses

related to $32 million
    of prior period accounting and valuation corrections for certain
    inventory items and an accrual of $5 million for contingent
    refund obligations.

Revenues

decreased $65 million, or 5 percent,
    due primarily to $75 million lower revenues associated with
    exchange imbalance settlements (offset in

costs and operating
    expenses

). Partially offsetting this decrease is a
    $9 million increase in revenue due to an adjustment for the
    recovery of state income tax rate changes (offset in

provision for income taxes

).

Costs and operating expenses

decreased $17 million,
    or 2 percent, due primarily to:

•

A decrease in costs of $75 million associated with exchange
    imbalance settlements (offset in

revenues

);

•

A decrease in costs of $37 million related to the absence
    of $32 million of 2005 prior period accounting and
    valuation corrections for certain inventory items and an accrual
    of $5 million for contingent refund obligations.

Partially offsetting these decreases are:

•

An increase in contract and outside service costs of
    $23 million due primarily to higher pipeline assessment and
    repair costs;

•

An increase in depreciation expense of $15 million due to
    property additions;

•

An increase in operating and maintenance expenses of
    $15 million;

•

An increase in operating taxes of $10 million;

•

The absence of $14 million of income in 2005 associated
    with the resolution of litigation;

•

The absence of $12 million of expense reductions during
    2005 related to the carrying value of certain liabilities.

SG&A expenses

increased $77 million, or
    92 percent, due primarily to:

•

An increase in personnel costs of $18 million;

•

The absence of a 2005 $17 million reduction in pension
    costs to correct an error in prior periods;

•

An increase in information systems support costs of
    $16 million;

•

An increase in property insurance expenses of $14 million;

•

The absence of $6 million of cost reductions in 2005 that
    related to correcting the carrying value of certain liabilities.

The $119 million, or 20 percent, decrease in

segment profit

is due primarily to the absence of
    significant 2005 adjustments as previously discussed, increases
    in

costs and operating expenses

and

SG&A expenses

as previously discussed, and the absence of a
    $5 million construction completion fee recognized in 2005
    related to our investment in Gulfstream.

Midstream
    Gas & Liquids

Overview
    of 2007

Midstream’s ongoing strategy is to safely and reliably
    operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets
    can be fully utilized and drive low

per-unit

costs. Our business is focused on consistently attracting new
    business by providing highly reliable service to our customers.



Significant events during 2007 include the following:

Continued
    favorable commodity price margins

The average realized natural gas liquid (NGL) per unit margins
    at our processing plants during 2007 was a record high 55 cents
    per gallon. NGL margins exceeded Midstream’s rolling
    five-year average for the last seven quarters. The geographic
    diversification of Midstream assets contributed significantly to
    our realized unit margins resulting in margins generally greater
    than that of the industry benchmarks for gas processed in the
    Henry Hub area and fractionated and sold at Mont Belvieu. The
    largest impact was realized at our western United States gas
    processing plants, which benefited from lower regional market
    natural gas prices.

Domestic
    Gathering and Processing Per Unit NGL Margin with Production
    and

Sales Volumes by Quarter

(excludes partially owned plants)

Expansion
    efforts in growth areas

Consistent with our strategy, we continued to expand our
    midstream operations where we have large-scale assets in growth
    basins.

During the first quarter of 2007, we completed construction at
    our existing gas processing complex located near Opal, Wyoming,
    to add a fifth cryogenic gas processing train capable of
    processing up to

350 MMcf/d,

bringing total Opal capacity to approximately

1,450 MMcf/d.

This plant expansion became operational during the first
    quarter. We also have several expansion projects ongoing in the
    West region to lower field pressures and increase production
    volumes for our customers who continue robust drilling
    activities in the region.

We continue construction of

37-mile

extensions of both of our oil and gas pipelines from our Devils
    Tower spar to the Blind Faith prospect located in Mississippi
    Canyon. These extensions, estimated to cost approximately
    $250 million, are expected to be ready for service by the
    second quarter of 2008.

During 2007, we have continued construction activities on the
    Perdido Norte project which includes oil and gas lines that
    would expand the scale of our existing infrastructure in the
    western deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we
    completed agreements with certain producers to provide
    gathering, processing and transportation services over the life
    of the reserves. We also intend to expand our Markham gas
    processing facility to adequately serve this new gas production.
    The scale of the project has increased to include additional
    pipeline and more



efficient processing capacity. The estimated cost is now
    approximately $560 million, and it is expected to be in
    service in the third quarter of 2009.

In July 2007, we exercised our right of first refusal to acquire
    BASF’s 5/12th ownership interest in the Geismar
    olefins facility for approximately $62 million. The
    acquisition increases our total ownership to 10/12th.

In March 2007, we announced plans to construct and operate the
    new Willow Creek facility, a

450 MMcf/d

natural gas processing plant in western Colorado’s Piceance
    basin, where Exploration & Production has its most
    significant volume of natural gas production, reserves and
    development activity. Exploration & Production’s
    existing Piceance basin processing plants are primarily designed
    to condition the natural gas to meet quality specifications for
    pipeline transmission, not to maximize the extraction of NGLs.
    We expect the new Willow Creek facility to recover
    25,000 barrels per day of NGLs at startup, which is
    expected to be in the third quarter of 2009.

In December 2007, we purchased the Parachute Lateral system from
    Gas Pipeline. The system is a 37.6-mile expansion, originally
    placed in service by Gas Pipeline in May 2007, and provides
    capacity of 450 Mdt/d through a

30-inch

diameter line, transporting residue gas from the Piceance basin
    to the Greasewood Hub in northwest Colorado. The Willow Creek
    facility will straddle the Parachute Lateral pipeline and will
    process gas flowing through the pipeline. In an arrangement
    approved by the FERC, Midstream will lease the pipeline to Gas
    Pipeline, who will continue to operate the pipeline until
    completion of a planned FERC abandonment filing.

In addition, we have acquired an existing natural gas pipeline
    from Gas Pipeline, and begun the process of converting it from
    natural gas to NGL service and constructing additional pipeline
    to create a pipeline alternative for NGLs currently being
    transported by truck from Exploration &
    Production’s existing Piceance basin processing plants to a
    major NGL transportation pipeline system.

We have also agreed to dedicate our equity NGL volumes from
    Willow Creek, along with our two Wyoming plants, for transport
    under a long-term shipping agreement with Overland Pass Pipeline
    Company, LLC. We currently have a 1 percent interest in
    Overland Pass Pipeline Company, LLC and have the option to
    increase our ownership to 50 percent and become the
    operator within two years of the pipeline becoming operational.

Start-up

is
    planned for mid-2008. The terms of the shipping agreement
    represent significant savings compared with agreements we are
    now utilizing.

Williams
    Partners L.P.

We currently own approximately 23.6 percent of Williams
    Partners L.P., including the interests of the general partner,
    which is wholly owned by us. Considering the control of the
    general partner in accordance with EITF Issue

No. 04-5,

Williams Partners L.P. is consolidated within the Midstream
    segment. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.) Midstream’s segment profit includes
    100 percent of Williams Partners L.P.’s segment
    profit, with the minority interest’s share deducted below
    segment profit. The debt and equity issued by Williams Partners
    L.P. to third parties is reported as a component of our
    consolidated debt balance and minority interest balance,
    respectively.

In June 2007, Williams Partners L.P. completed its acquisition
    of our 20 percent interest in Discovery Producer Services,
    LLC (Discovery). Williams Partners L.P. now owns a
    60 percent interest in Discovery.

In December 2007, Williams Partners L.P. acquired certain of our
    membership interests in Wamsutter LLC, the limited liability
    company that owns the Wamsutter system, from us for
    $750 million. Williams Partners L.P. completed the
    transaction after successfully closing a public equity offering
    of 9.25 million common units that yielded net proceeds of
    approximately $335 million. The partnership primarily
    financed the remainder of the purchase price through utilizing
    $250 million of term loan borrowings and issuing
    approximately $157 million of common units to us. The
    $250 million term loan is under Williams Partners
    L.P.’s new $450 million five-year senior unsecured
    credit facility that became effective simultaneous with the
    closing of the Wamsutter transaction. (See Note 11 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.)



Ignacio
    Gas Processing Plant Fire

On November 28, 2007, there was a fire at the Ignacio gas
    processing plant. This fire resulted in severe damage to the
    facility’s cooling tower, control room, adjacent warehouse
    buildings and control systems. The plant was shut down until
    January 18, 2008. There were no injuries as a result of
    this incident and the plant now has full cryogenic recovery
    capability available for operation. The impact of the fire was
    immaterial to our results of operations.

Outlook
    for 2008

The following factors could impact our business in 2008 and
    beyond.

•

As evidenced in recent years, natural gas and crude oil markets
    are highly volatile. NGL margins earned at our gas processing
    plants in the last seven quarters were above our rolling
    five-year average, due to global economics maintaining high
    crude prices which correlate to strong NGL prices in
    relationship to natural gas prices. Forecasted domestic demand
    for ethylene and propylene, along with political instability in
    many of the key oil producing countries, currently support NGL
    margins continuing to exceed our rolling five-year average.
    Natural gas prices in the Rocky Mountain areas have trended
    lower throughout 2007 due to strong drilling activities
    increasing supplies while third-party production volumes have
    been constrained by limited pipeline capacity. The construction
    of a new third-party pipeline that began transporting gas from
    the Rocky Mountain areas in the beginning of 2008 would indicate
    increasing natural gas prices, moderating our future NGL margins.

•

If the previously mentioned Overland Pass pipeline is not
    completed as scheduled, our NGL transportation costs will
    increase in the short-term over 2007 levels. When the pipeline
    is complete, the terms of our transportation agreement represent
    significant savings compared to 2007.

•

As part of our efforts to manage commodity price risks on an
    enterprise basis, during December 2007 and January and February
    2008, we entered into various financial contracts. Approximately
    28 percent of our forecasted domestic NGL sales for 2008
    are hedged with collar agreements or fixed-price swap contracts.
    Approximately 24 percent of our forecasted domestic NGL
    sales have been hedged with collar agreements at a weighted
    average sales price range of 9 percent to 22 percent
    above our average 2007 domestic NGL sales price and
    approximately 4 percent of our forecasted domestic NGL
    sales have been hedged with fixed-price swap contracts. The
    natural gas shrink requirements associated with the sales under
    the fixed-price swap contracts have also been hedged through Gas
    Marketing Services with physical gas purchase contracts, thus
    effectively hedging the margin on the volumes associated with
    fixed price swap contracts at a level about two times our
    rolling five-year average and approximating our 2007 average.

•

Margins in our olefins business are highly dependent upon
    continued economic growth within the United States and any
    significant slow down in the economy would reduce the demand for
    the petrochemical products we produce in both Canada and the
    United States. Based on our increased ownership in our Geismar
    facility, we anticipate results from our olefins business to be
    above 2007 levels.

•

Gathering and processing fee revenues in our West region in 2008
    are expected to be at or slightly above levels of previous years
    due to continued strong drilling activities in our core basins.

•

We expect fee revenues in our Gulf Coast region to increase in
    2008 as we expand our Devil’s Tower infrastructure to serve
    the Blind Faith and Bass Lite prospects. This increase is
    expected to be partially offset by lower volumes in other
    deepwater areas due to natural declines. Fee revenues include
    gathering, processing, production handling and transportation
    fees.

•

Revenues from deepwater production areas are often subject to
    risks associated with the interruption and timing of product
    flows which can be influenced by weather and other third-party
    operational issues.

•

The construction of deepwater pipelines is subject to the risk
    of pipe collapse from stresses during installation as well as
    from high hydrostatic pressure that could delay completion and
    increase costs. Our Perdido Norte project is located in the Gulf
    Coast region in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and subject to
    these risks.



•

We will continue to invest in facilities in the growth basins in
    which we provide services. We expect continued expansion of our
    gathering and processing systems in our Gulf Coast and West
    regions to keep pace with increased demand for our services. As
    we pursue these activities, our operating and general and
    administrative expenses are expected to increase.

•

We expect continued expansion in the deepwater areas of the Gulf
    of Mexico to contribute to our future segment revenues and
    segment profit. We expect these additional fee-based revenues to
    lower our proportionate exposure to commodity price risks.

•

The Venezuelan government continues its public criticism of
    U.S. economic and political policy, has implemented
    unilateral changes to existing energy related contracts, and has
    expropriated privately held assets within the energy and
    telecommunications sector, escalating our concern regarding
    political risk in Venezuela.

•

Our right of way agreement with the Jicarilla Apache Nation
    (JAN), which covered certain gathering system assets in Rio
    Arriba County of northern New Mexico, expired on
    December 31, 2006. We currently operate our gathering
    assets on the JAN lands pursuant to a special business license
    granted by the JAN which expires February 29, 2008. We are
    engaged in discussions with the JAN designed to result in the
    sale of our gathering assets which are located on or are
    isolated by the JAN lands. Provided the parties are able to
    reach an acceptable value on the sale of the subject gathering
    assets, our expectation is that we will nonetheless maintain
    partial revenues associated with gathering and processing
    downstream of the JAN lands and continue to operate the
    gathering assets on the JAN lands for an undetermined period of
    time beyond February 29, 2008. Based on current estimated
    gathering volumes and range of annual average commodity prices
    over the past five years, we estimate that gas produced on or
    isolated by the JAN lands represents approximately
    $20 million to $30 million of the West region’s
    annual gathering and processing revenue less related product
    costs.

In order to provide additional clarity, our management’s
    discussion and analysis of operating results separately reflects
    the portion of general and administrative expense not allocated
    to an asset group as

indirect general and administrative
    expense

. These charges represent any overhead cost not
    directly attributable to one of the specific asset groups noted
    in this discussion.

2007 vs.

The $1,021 million, or 25 percent, increase in

segment revenues

is largely due to:

•

A $528 million increase in revenues from the marketing of
    NGLs and olefins;

•

A $303 million increase in revenues from our olefins
    production business;

•

A $244 million increase in revenues associated with the
    production of NGLs.

These increases are partially offset by a $35 million
    decrease in fee revenues.



Segment costs and expenses

increased $645 million,
    or 18 percent, primarily as a result of:

•

A $491 million increase in NGL and olefin marketing
    purchases;

•

A $257 million increase in costs from our olefins
    production business;

•

A $37 million increase in operating expenses including
    higher depreciation, maintenance, gathering fuel expenses and
    operating taxes;

•

$24 million higher general and administrative expenses;

•

A $10 million loss on impairment of the Carbonate Trend
    pipeline and an $8 million loss on impairment of certain
    other assets;

•

The absence of $11 million of net gains on the sales of
    assets in 2006.

These increases are partially offset by;

•

The absence of a 2006 charge of $73 million related to our
    Gulf Liquids litigation (see Note 15 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements);

•

A $95 million decrease in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs due primarily to lower natural gas prices;

•

$12 million income in 2007 from a favorable litigation
    outcome.

The $397 million, or 59 percent, increase in
    Midstream’s

segment profit

reflects
    $339 million higher NGL margins and the absence of the
    previously mentioned $73 million Gulf Liquids litigation
    charge in 2006, as well as the other previously described
    changes in

segment revenues

and

segment costs and
    expenses.

A more detailed analysis of the segment profit of
    Midstream’s various operations is presented as follows.

Domestic
    gathering & processing

The $266 million increase in

domestic gathering and
    processing segment profit

includes a $308 million
    increase in the West region, partially offset by a
    $42 million decrease in the Gulf Coast region.

The $308 million increase in our West region’s

segment profit

primarily results from higher NGL margins,
    higher processing fee based revenues and income from a favorable
    litigation outcome, partially offset by higher operating
    expenses and lower gathering fee revenues. The significant
    components of this increase include the following:

•

NGL margins increased $326 million in 2007 compared to
    2006. This increase was driven by an increase in average per
    unit NGL prices, a decrease in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs reflecting lower natural gas prices and
    higher volumes due primarily to new capacity on the fifth
    cryogenic train at our Opal plant.

•

Processing fee revenues increased $12 million. Processing
    volumes are higher due to customers electing to take liquids and
    pay processing fees.

•

$12 million income in 2007 from a favorable litigation
    outcome.

•

Gathering fee revenues decreased $6 million due primarily
    to natural volume declines and the shutdown of the Ignacio plant
    in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of the fire.

•

Operating expenses increased $21 million including
    $9 million in higher depreciation, $9 million in
    higher treating plant and gathering fuel due primarily to the
    expiration of a favorable gas purchase contract, $5 million
    related to gas imbalance revaluation losses in the current year
    compared to gains in the prior year, $5 million higher
    leased compression costs and $4 million higher costs
    related to the Jicarilla lease arrangement. These were partially
    offset by the absence of a $7 million accounts payable
    accrual adjustment in 2006 and $5 million in lower system
    product losses.



The $42 million decrease in the Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

is primarily a result of lower volumes
    from our deepwater facilities, losses on impairments, and the
    absence of gains on assets in 2006, partially offset by higher
    NGL margins and higher other fee revenues. The significant
    components of this decrease include the following:

•

Fee revenues from our deepwater assets decreased
    $40 million due primarily to declines in producers’
    volumes.

•

A $10 million loss on impairment of the Carbonate Trend
    pipeline and a $6 million loss on impairment of certain
    other assets.

•

The absence of $8 million in gains on the sales of certain
    gathering assets and a processing plant in 2006 and
    $5 million lower involuntary conversion gains resulting
    from insurance proceeds used to rebuild the Cameron Meadows
    plant.

•

NGL margins increased $14 million driven by higher NGL
    prices, partially offset by lower NGL recoveries and an increase
    in costs associated with the production of NGLs.

•

Other fee revenues increased $8 million driven by higher
    water removal fees.

Venezuela

Segment profit

for our Venezuela assets decreased
    $9 million. The decrease is primarily due to the absence of
    a $9 million gain from the settlement of a contract dispute
    in 2006, $6 million lower fee revenues due primarily to the
    discontinuance in 2007 of revenue recognition related to labor
    escalation receivables, $7 million higher operating
    expenses, and $8 million higher bad debt expense related to
    labor escalation receivables, partially offset by
    $19 million of higher currency exchange gains and
    $1 million higher equity earnings.

Other

The significant components of the $158 million increase in

segment profit

of our other operations include the
    following:

•

The absence of the previously mentioned $73 million Gulf
    Liquids litigation charge in 2006;

•

$46 million in higher margins from our olefins production
    business due primarily to the increase in ownership of the
    Geismar olefins facility in July 2007 and higher prices of NGL
    products produced in our Canadian olefins operations;

•

$18 million in higher margins related to the marketing of
    olefins and $21 million in higher margins related to the
    marketing of NGLs due to more favorable changes in pricing while
    product was in transit during 2007 as compared to 2006;

•

An $8 million reversal of a maintenance accrual (see below);

•

$9 million higher Aux Sable equity earnings primarily due
    to favorable processing margins;

•

$11 million higher Discovery equity earnings primarily due
    to higher NGL margins and volumes.

These increases are partially offset by:

•

$19 million in higher foreign exchange losses related to
    the revaluation of current assets held in U.S. dollars
    within our Canadian operations;

•

The absence of a $4 million favorable transportation
    settlement in 2006.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Staff Position
    (FSP) No. AUG AIR-1,

Accounting for Planned Major
    Maintenance Activities.

As a result, we recognized as other
    income an $8 million reversal of an accrual for major
    maintenance on our Geismar ethane cracker. We did not apply the
    FSP retrospectively because the impact to our first quarter 2007
    and estimated full year 2007 earnings, as well as the impact to
    prior periods, is not material. We have adopted the deferral
    method for accounting for these costs going forward.



Indirect
    general and administrative expense

The $18 million, or 26 percent, increase in indirect
    general and administrative expense is due primarily to higher
    technical support services and other charges for various
    administrative support functions and higher employee expenses.

2006 vs.

The $868 million, or 26 percent, increase in

segment revenues

is largely due to:

•

A $561 million increase in crude marketing revenues, which
    is offset by a similar change in costs, resulting from
    additional deepwater production coming on-line in November 2005;

•

A $165 million increase in revenues associated with the
    production of NGLs, primarily due to higher NGL prices combined
    with higher volumes;

•

A $137 million increase in the marketing of NGLs and
    olefins, which is offset by a similar change in costs;

•

An $83 million increase in fee-based revenues including
    $52 million in higher production handling revenues;

•

A $44 million increase in revenues in our olefins unit due
    to higher volumes.

These increases were partially offset by an $84 million
    reduction in NGL revenues due to a change in classification of
    NGL transportation and fractionation expenses from costs of
    goods sold to net revenues (offset in costs and operating
    expenses).

Segment costs and expenses

increased $688 million,
    or 23 percent, primarily as a result of:

•

A $561 million increase in crude marketing purchases, which
    is offset by a similar change in revenues;

•

A $137 million increase in NGL and olefins marketing
    purchases, offset by a similar change in revenues;

•

An $82 million increase in operating expenses including an
    $11 million accounts payable accrual adjustment, higher
    system losses, depreciation, insurance expense, personnel and
    related benefit expenses, turbine overhauls, materials and
    supplies, compression and post-hurricane inspection and survey
    costs required by a government agency;

•

A $59 million increase in other expense including the
    $73 million charge related to the Gulf Liquids litigation,
    partially offset by a $9 million favorable settlement of a
    contract dispute;

•

A $20 million increase in costs associated with production
    in our olefins unit.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

An $84 million reduction in NGL transportation and
    fractionation expenses due to the above-noted change in
    classification (offset in revenues);

•

A $77 million decrease in plant fuel and costs associated
    with the production of NGLs due primarily to lower gas prices.

The $215 million, or 47 percent, increase in Midstream

segment profit

is primarily due to higher NGL margins,
    higher deepwater production handling revenues, higher gathering
    and processing revenues, higher margins from our olefins unit,
    and a settlement of an international contract dispute, and the
    absence of a $23 million impairment of our equity
    investment in Aux Sable Liquid Products L.P. (Aux Sable)
    recorded in 2005. These increases were largely offset by the
    $73 million charge related to the Gulf Liquids litigation
    contingency combined with higher operating costs and lower
    margins related to the marketing of olefins and NGLs. A more
    detailed analysis of the

segment profit

of
    Midstream’s various operations is presented as follows.



Domestic
    gathering & processing

The $242 million increase in

domestic gathering and
    processing segment profit

includes a $138 million
    increase in the West region and a $104 million increase in
    the Gulf Coast region.

The $138 million increase in our West region’s

segment profit

primarily results from higher product
    margins and higher gathering and processing revenues, partially
    offset by higher operating expenses. The significant components
    of this increase include the following:

•

NGL margins increased $166 million compared to 2005. This
    increase was driven by a decrease in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs, an increase in average per unit NGL prices
    and higher volumes resulting from lower NGL recoveries during
    the fourth quarter of 2005 caused by intermittent periods of
    uneconomical market commodity prices and a power outage and
    associated operational issues at our Opal, Wyoming facility. NGL
    margins are defined as NGL revenues less BTU replacement cost,
    plant fuel, and transportation and fractionation expense.

•

Gathering and processing fee revenues increased
    $26 million. Gathering fees are higher as a result of
    higher average

per-unit

gathering rates. Processing volumes are higher due to customers
    electing to take liquids and pay processing fees.

•

Operating expenses increased $51 million including
    $11 million in higher net system product losses as a result
    of system gains in 2005 compared to losses in 2006, a
    $7 million accounts payable accrual adjustment;
    $8 million in higher personnel and related benefit
    expenses; $6 million in higher materials and supplies;
    $6 million in higher gathering fuel, $4 million in
    higher leased compression costs; $4 million in higher
    turbine overhaul costs; and $4 million in higher
    depreciation.

The $104 million increase in the Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

is primarily a result of higher NGL
    margins, higher volumes from our deepwater facilities, partially
    offset by higher operating expenses. The significant components
    of this increase include the following:

•

NGL margins increased $77 million compared to 2005. This
    increase was driven by an increase in average per unit NGL
    prices and a decrease in costs associated with the production of
    NGLs.

•

Fee revenues from our deepwater assets increased
    $52 million as a result of $51 million in higher
    volumes flowing across the Devils Tower facility and
    $22 million in higher Devils Tower unit-of-production rates
    recognized as a result of a new reserve study. These increases
    are partially offset by a $21 million decline in other
    gathering and production handling revenues due to volume
    declines in other areas.

•

Operating expenses increased $25 million primarily as a
    result of $12 million in higher insurance costs,
    $4 million in higher depreciation expense on our deepwater
    assets, $3 million in higher net system product losses as a
    result of lower gain volumes in 2006, $2 million in
    post-hurricane inspection and survey costs required by a
    government agency, and a $1 million accounts payable
    accrual adjustment.

Venezuela

Segment profit

for our Venezuela assets increased
    $3 million and includes $9 million resulting from the
    settlement of a contract dispute and $1 million in higher
    revenues due to higher natural gas volumes and prices at our
    compression facility. These are partially offset by
    $4 million in higher expenses related to higher insurance,
    personnel and contract labor costs and a $2 million
    increase in the reserve for uncollectible accounts.

Other

The $26 million decrease in

segment profit

of our
    other operations is largely due to the $73 million of
    charges related to the Gulf Liquids litigation contingency
    combined with $13 million in lower margins related to the
    marketing of olefins. The decrease also reflects
    $12 million in lower margins related to the marketing of
    NGLs due to more favorable changes in pricing while product was
    in transit during 2005 as compared to 2006. These were partially
    offset by the absence of a $23 million impairment of our
    equity investment in Aux Sable in 2005, $24 million in
    higher margins in our olefins unit, $7 million in higher
    earnings from our equity investment in



Discovery Producer Services, L.L.C. (Discovery), $7 million
    in higher fractionation, storage and other fee revenues, and a
    $4 million favorable transportation settlement.

Gas
    Marketing Services

Gas Marketing Services (Gas Marketing) primarily supports our
    natural gas businesses by providing marketing and risk
    management services, which include marketing and hedging the gas
    produced by Exploration & Production, and procuring
    fuel and shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids sales for
    Midstream. In addition, Gas Marketing manages various natural
    gas-related contracts such as transportation, storage, and
    related hedges, including certain legacy natural gas contracts
    and positions, and provides services to third parties, such as
    producers.

Overview
    of 2007

Gas Marketing’s operating results for 2007 were primarily
    driven by a loss of approximately $166 million related to
    certain legacy derivative natural gas contracts that we expect
    to assign to another party in 2008 under an asset transfer
    agreement that we executed in December 2007. In addition, a
    decrease in forward natural gas basis prices against a net long
    legacy derivative position contributed to the losses as well.

Outlook
    for 2008

For 2008, Gas Marketing intends to focus on providing services
    that support our natural gas businesses. Certain legacy natural
    gas contracts and positions from our former Power segment remain
    in the Gas Marketing segment. Gas Marketing’s earnings may
    continue to reflect mark-to-market volatility from
    commodity-based derivatives that represent economic hedges but
    are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes or do not
    qualify for hedge accounting. However, this mark-to-market
    volatility is expected to be significantly reduced compared with
    previous levels.

2007 vs.

Realized revenues

represent (1) revenue from the
    sale of natural gas and (2) gains and losses from the net
    financial settlement of derivative contracts.

Realized
    revenues

decreased $237 million primarily due to a
    decrease in net financial settlements of derivative contracts.
    This is partially offset by an increase in physical natural gas
    revenue as a result of a 9 percent increase in natural gas
    sales volumes partially offset by a 6 percent decrease in
    average prices on physical natural gas sales.

Net forward unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses)

primarily represent changes in the fair values of certain
    legacy derivative contracts with a future settlement or delivery
    date that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes
    or do not qualify for hedge accounting. A $156 million loss
    related to a legacy derivative natural gas sales contract, that
    we expect to assign to another party in 2008 under an asset
    transfer agreement that we executed in



December 2007, primarily caused the unfavorable change in

net
    forward unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses)

. Prior to
    the execution of the asset transfer agreement, we accounted for
    this legacy contract on an accrual basis under the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception of SFAS 133. Due to
    the pending assignment of the legacy contract, we no longer
    consider the contract to be in the normal course of business.
    Therefore, we recognized a loss to reflect the current negative
    fair value of the contract. In addition, losses on gas purchase
    contracts caused by a decrease in forward natural gas prices
    were greater in 2007 than in 2006.

The $321 million decrease in Gas Marketing’s

costs
    and operating expenses

is primarily due to a 7 percent
    decrease in average prices on physical natural gas purchases,
    partially offset by a 4 percent increase in natural gas
    purchase volumes.

The unfavorable change in

selling, general and administrative
    (income) expense

is due primarily to the absence of a
    $25 million gain from the sale of certain receivables to a
    third party in 2006.

Other (income) expense — net

in 2007 includes a
    $20 million accrual for litigation contingencies.

The $142 million increase in

segment loss

is
    primarily due to the loss recognized on a legacy derivative
    sales contract previously treated as a normal purchase and
    normal sale, a $20 million accrual for litigation
    contingencies, and the absence of a $25 million gain from
    the sale of certain receivables as described above, partially
    offset by an improvement in accrual gross margin.

2006 vs.

Realized revenues

decreased $962 million primarily
    due to a 17 percent decrease in average prices on physical
    natural gas sales.

The effect of a change in forward prices on legacy natural gas
    derivative contracts primarily caused the $324 million
    unfavorable change in

net forward unrealized mark-to-market
    gains (losses)

. A decrease in forward natural gas prices
    during 2006 caused losses on legacy net forward gas fixed-price
    purchase contracts, while an increase in forward natural gas
    prices during 2005 caused gains on legacy net forward gas
    fixed-price purchase contracts.

The $980 million decrease in Gas Marketing’s

costs
    and operating expenses

is primarily due to an
    18 percent decrease in average prices on physical natural
    gas purchases.

The favorable change in

selling, general and administrative
    (income) expense

is due primarily to increased gains from
    the sale of certain receivables to a third party. Gas Marketing
    recognized a $25 million gain in 2006 compared to a
    $10 million gain in 2005.

Other (income) expense — net

in 2005 includes
    an $82 million accrual for estimated litigation
    contingencies, primarily associated with agreements reached to
    substantially resolve exposure related to natural gas price and
    volume reporting issues (see Note 15 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements) and a $5 million accrual
    for a regulatory settlement.

The $204 million change from a

segment profit

to a

segment loss

is primarily due to the effect of a change
    in forward prices on legacy natural gas derivative contracts,
    partially offset by favorable changes in

other (income)
    expense — net

described above.

    impairment charges, of which $38 million was recorded
    during the fourth quarter, related to our investment in
    Longhorn. In a related matter, we wrote off $4 million of
    capitalized project costs associated with Longhorn. We also
    recorded $24 million of equity losses associated with our
    investment in Longhorn. Partially offsetting these charges and
    losses was a $9 million fourth quarter gain on the sale of
    land.

Fair
    Value of Trading and Nontrading Derivatives

The chart below reflects the fair value of derivatives held for
    trading purposes as of December 31, 2007. We have presented
    the fair value of assets and liabilities by the period in which
    they would be realized under their contractual terms and not as
    a result of a sale. We have reported the fair value of a portion
    of these derivatives in assets and liabilities of discontinued
    operations. (See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.)

As the table above illustrates, we are not materially engaged in
    trading activities. However, we hold a substantial portfolio of
    nontrading derivative contracts. Nontrading derivative contracts
    are those that hedge or could possibly hedge forecasted
    transactions on an economic basis. We have designated certain of
    these contracts as cash flow hedges of Exploration &
    Production’s forecasted sales of natural gas production and
    Midstream’s forecasted sales of natural gas liquids under
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133). Of the
    total fair value of nontrading derivatives, SFAS 133 cash
    flow hedges had a net liability value of $268 million as of
    December 31, 2007. The chart below reflects the fair value
    of derivatives held for nontrading purposes as of
    December 31, 2007, for Gas Marketing Services,
    Exploration & Production, Midstream, and nontrading
    derivatives reported in assets and liabilities of discontinued
    operations.

Methods
    of Estimating Fair Value

Most of the derivatives we hold settle in active periods and
    markets in which quoted market prices are available. These
    include futures contracts, option contracts, swap agreements and
    physical commodity purchases and sales in the commodity markets
    in which we transact. While an active market may not exist for
    the entire period, quoted prices can generally be obtained for
    natural gas through 2012.

These prices reflect current economic and regulatory conditions
    and may change because of market conditions. The availability of
    quoted market prices in active markets varies between periods
    and commodities based



upon changes in market conditions. The ability to obtain quoted
    market prices also varies greatly from region to region. The
    time periods noted above are an estimation of aggregate
    availability of quoted prices. An immaterial portion of our
    total net derivative liability value of $368 million
    relates to periods in which active quotes cannot be obtained. We
    estimate energy commodity prices in these illiquid periods by
    incorporating information about commodity prices in actively
    quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets, and other
    market fundamental analysis. Modeling and other valuation
    techniques, however, are not used significantly in determining
    the fair value of our derivatives.

Counterparty
    Credit Considerations

We include an assessment of the risk of counterparty
    nonperformance in our estimate of fair value for all contracts.
    Such assessment considers (1) the credit rating of each
    counterparty as represented by public rating agencies such as
    Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors
    Service, (2) the inherent default probabilities within
    these ratings, (3) the regulatory environment that the
    contract is subject to and (4) the terms of each individual
    contract.

Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could
    ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows.
    We continually assess this risk. We have credit protection
    within various agreements to call on additional collateral
    support if necessary. At December 31, 2007, we held
    collateral support, including letters of credit, of
    $215 million.

We also enter into master netting agreements to mitigate
    counterparty performance and credit risk. During 2007 and 2006,
    we did not incur any significant losses due to recent
    counterparty bankruptcy filings.

The gross credit exposure from our derivative contracts, a
    portion of which is included in assets of discontinued
    operations (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements), as of December 31, 2007, is summarized below.

(a)

We determine investment grade primarily using publicly available
    credit ratings. We include counterparties with a minimum
    Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB— or
    Moody’s Investors Service rating of Baa3 in investment
    grade. We also classify counterparties that have provided
    sufficient collateral, such as cash, standby letters of credit,
    adequate parent company guarantees, and property interests, as
    investment grade.

Trading
    Policy

We have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk
    management activities. These policies cover authority and
    delegation thereof in addition to control requirements,
    authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations.

Value-at-risk

is limited in aggregate and calculated at a 95 percent
    confidence level.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

Outlook

We believe we have, or have access to, the financial resources
    and liquidity necessary to meet future requirements for working
    capital, capital and investment expenditures and debt payments
    while maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity to reasonably
    protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring the use of
    funds. We also expect to maintain our investment grade status.
    In 2008, we expect to maintain liquidity from cash and cash
    equivalents and unused revolving credit facilities of at least
    $1 billion. We maintain adequate liquidity to manage margin
    requirements related to significant movements in commodity
    prices, unplanned capital spending needs, near term scheduled
    debt payments, and litigation and other settlements. We expect
    to fund capital and investment expenditures, debt payments,
    dividends, stock repurchases and working capital requirements
    through cash flow from operations, which is currently estimated
    to be between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in 2008,
    proceeds from debt issuances and sales of units of Williams
    Partners L.P. and Williams Pipeline Partners L.P., as well as
    cash and cash equivalents on hand as needed.

We enter 2008 positioned for continued growth through
    disciplined investments in our natural gas businesses. Examples
    of this planned growth include:

•

Exploration & Production will continue to maintain its
    development drilling program in its key basins of Piceance,
    Powder River, San Juan, Arkoma, and Fort Worth.

•

Gas Pipeline will continue to expand its system to meet the
    demand of growth markets.

•

Midstream will continue to pursue significant deepwater
    production commitments and expand capacity in the western United
    States.

We estimate capital and investment expenditures will total
    approximately $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion in 2008. As
    a result of increasing our development drilling program,
    $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion of the total estimated
    2008 capital expenditures is related to Exploration &
    Production. Also within the total estimated expenditures for
    2008 is approximately $180 million to $260 million for
    compliance and maintenance-related projects at Gas Pipeline,
    including Clean Air Act compliance. Commitments for construction
    and acquisition of property, plant and equipment are
    approximately $484 million at December 31, 2007.

Potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity
    and the planned capital and investment expenditures discussed
    above include:

•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations due to
    commodity pricing volatility. To mitigate this exposure,
    Exploration & Production has fixed-price hedges for
    approximately 70 MMcfe per day of its expected 2008
    production. In addition, Exploration & Production has
    collar agreements for 2008 which hedge approximately
    397 MMcfe per day of expected 2008 production.

•

Sensitivity of margin requirements associated with our
    marginable commodity contracts. As of December 31, 2007, we
    estimate our exposure to additional margin requirements through
    2008 to be no more than $125 million, using a statistical
    analysis at a 99 percent confidence level.



•

Exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and
    litigation issues (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements).

•

The impact of a general economic downturn, including any
    associated volatility in the credit markets and our access to
    liquidity and the capital markets.

In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed
    into law. The Act makes significant changes to the requirements
    for employer-sponsored retirement plans, including revisions
    affecting the funding of defined benefit pension plans beginning
    in 2008. We have assessed the impact of the legislation on our
    future funding requirements and do not expect a significant
    increase in minimum funding requirements over current levels,
    assuming long-term rates of return on assets and current
    discount rates do not experience a significant decline.

Overview

In February 2007, Exploration & Production entered
    into a five-year unsecured credit agreement with certain banks
    in order to reduce margin requirements related to our hedging
    activities as well as lower transaction fees. Under the credit
    agreement, Exploration & Production is not required to
    post collateral as long as the value of its domestic natural gas
    reserves, as determined under the provisions of the agreement,
    exceeds by a specified amount certain of its obligations
    including any outstanding debt and the aggregate
    out-of-the-money positions on hedges entered into under the
    credit agreement. Exploration & Production is subject
    to additional covenants under the credit agreement including
    restrictions on hedge limits, the creation of liens, the
    incurrence of debt, the sale of assets and properties, and
    making certain payments, such as dividends, under certain
    circumstances.

On April 4, 2007, Northwest Pipeline retired
    $175 million of 8.125 percent senior notes due 2010.
    Northwest Pipeline paid premiums of approximately
    $7 million in conjunction with the early debt retirement.

On April 5, 2007, Northwest Pipeline issued
    $185 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.95 percent senior unsecured notes due 2017 to certain
    institutional investors in a private debt placement. Northwest
    Pipeline initiated an exchange offer on July 26, 2007,
    which expired on August 23, 2007. Northwest Pipeline
    received full participation in the exchange offer. (See
    Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In July 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
    of up to $1 billion of our common stock. We intend to
    purchase shares of our stock from time to time in open market
    transactions or through privately negotiated or structured
    transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and
    other factors. This stock-repurchase program does not have an
    expiration date. We plan to fund this program with cash on hand.
    In 2007, we purchased approximately 16 million shares for
    $526 million under the program at an average cost of $33.08
    per share.

During third-quarter 2007, we formed Williams Pipeline Partners
    L.P. (WMZ) to own and operate natural gas transportation and
    storage assets. In January 2008, WMZ completed its initial
    public offering of 16.25 million common units at a price of
    $20.00 per unit. In February 2008, the underwriters also
    exercised their right to purchase an additional
    1.65 million common units at the same price. A subsidiary
    of ours serves as the general partner of WMZ. The initial asset
    of the partnership is a 35 percent interest in Northwest
    Pipeline GP, formerly Northwest Pipeline Corporation. Upon
    completion of the transaction, we hold approximately
    47.7 percent of the interests in WMZ, including the
    interests of the general partner.

In December 2007, Williams Partners L.P. acquired certain of our
    membership interests in Wamsutter LLC, the limited liability
    company that owns the Wamsutter system, from us for
    $750 million. Williams Partners L.P. completed the
    transaction after successfully closing a public equity offering
    of 9.25 million common units that yielded net proceeds of
    approximately $335 million. The partnership financed the
    remainder of the purchase price primarily through utilizing
    $250 million of term loan borrowings and issuing
    approximately $157 million of common units to us. The
    $250 million term loan is under Williams Partners
    L.P.’s new $450 million five-year senior unsecured
    credit facility that became effective simultaneous with the
    closing of the Wamsutter transaction. The remaining
    $200 million of capacity under the new facility is
    available for revolving credit borrowings.

In December 2007, we repurchased $213 million of our
    7.125 percent senior unsecured notes due September 2011 and
    $22 million of our 8.125 percent senior unsecured
    notes due March 2012. In conjunction with these early



retirements, we paid premiums of approximately $19 million.
    These premiums, as well as related fees and expenses are
    recorded as

early debt retirement costs

in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income.

Credit
    ratings

On March 19, 2007, Standard & Poor’s raised
    our senior unsecured debt rating from a BB− to a BB with a
    stable ratings outlook. On May 21, 2007,
    Standard & Poor’s revised its ratings outlook to
    positive from stable. On November 9, 2007,
    Standard & Poor’s raised our senior unsecured
    debt rating from a BB to a BB+ and our corporate credit rating
    from a BB+ to a BBB− with a ratings outlook of stable.
    With respect to Standard & Poor’s, a rating of
    “BBB” or above indicates an investment grade rating. A
    rating below “BBB” indicates that the security has
    significant speculative characteristics. A “BB” rating
    indicates that Standard & Poor’s believes the
    issuer has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
    obligation, but adverse business conditions could lead to
    insufficient ability to meet financial commitments.
    Standard & Poor’s may modify its ratings with a
    “+” or a “− ” sign to show the
    obligor’s relative standing within a major rating category.

On May 21, 2007, Moody’s Investors Service placed our
    ratings under review for possible upgrade. On November 15,
    2007, Moody’s Investors Service raised our senior unsecured
    debt rating from a Ba2 to a Baa3 with a ratings outlook of
    stable. With respect to Moody’s, a rating of
    “Baa” or above indicates an investment grade rating. A
    rating below “Baa” is considered to have speculative
    elements. A “Ba” rating indicates an obligation that
    is judged to have speculative elements and is subject to
    substantial credit risk. The “1”, “2” and
    “3” modifiers show the relative standing within a
    major category. A “1” indicates that an obligation
    ranks in the higher end of the broad rating category,
    “2” indicates a mid-range ranking, and “3”
    ranking at the lower end of the category.

On May 21, 2007, Fitch Ratings revised its ratings outlook
    to positive from stable. On November 20, 2007, Fitch
    Ratings raised our senior unsecured debt rating from a BB+ to a
    BBB− with a ratings outlook of stable. With respect to
    Fitch, a rating of “BBB” or above indicates an
    investment grade rating. A rating below “BBB” is
    considered speculative grade. A “BB” rating from Fitch
    indicates that there is a possibility of credit risk developing,
    particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time;
    however, business or financial alternatives may be available to
    allow financial commitments to be met. Fitch may add a
    “+” or a “− ” sign to show the
    obligor’s relative standing within a major rating category.

Liquidity

Our internal and external sources of liquidity include cash
    generated from our operations, bank financings, and proceeds
    from the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities, and
    proceeds from asset sales. While most of our sources are
    available to us at the parent level, others are available to
    certain of our subsidiaries, including equity and debt issuances
    from Williams Partners L.P. and Williams Pipeline Partners L.P.
    Our ability to raise funds in the capital markets will be
    impacted by our financial condition, interest rates, market
    conditions, and industry conditions.

Northwest Pipeline and Transco each have access to
    $400 million under this facility to the extent not utilized
    by us. In 2007, Northwest Pipeline borrowed $250 million
    under this facility to retire matured notes, and in January
    2008, Transco borrowed $100 million.

In addition to the above, Northwest Pipeline and Transco have
    shelf registration statements available for the issuance of up
    to $350 million aggregate principal amount of debt
    securities. If the credit rating of Northwest Pipeline or
    Transco is below investment grade for all credit rating
    agencies, they can only use their shelf registration statements
    to issue debt if such debt is guaranteed by us.

Williams Partners L.P. has a shelf registration statement
    available for the issuance of approximately $1.2 billion
    aggregate principal amount of debt and limited partnership unit
    securities.

In addition, at the parent-company level, we have a shelf
    registration statement that allows us to issue publicly
    registered debt and equity securities as needed.

In February 2007, Exploration & Production entered
    into a five-year unsecured credit agreement with certain banks
    which serves to reduce our usage of cash and other credit
    facilities for margin requirements related to our hedging
    activities as well as lower transaction fees. (See Note 11
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

On May 9, 2007, we amended our $1.5 billion unsecured
    credit facility extending the maturity date from May 1,
    2009 to May 1, 2012. Applicable borrowing rates and
    commitment fees for investment grade credit ratings were also
    modified.

Operating
    Activities

Our

net cash provided by operating activities

in 2007
    increased from 2006 due primarily to the increase in our
    operating results and the absence of a $145 million
    securities litigation settlement payment in 2006. These
    increases are partially offset by increased income tax payments
    in 2007 and other changes in working capital.

Our

net cash provided by operating activities

in 2006
    increased from 2005 due largely to higher operating income at
    Midstream, partially offset by a $145 million securities
    litigation settlement payment in fourth quarter 2006.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes.” As of December 31, 2007, we have accrued
    approximately $76 million for unrecognized tax benefits. We
    cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of the
    future payments of these liabilities. Therefore, these
    liabilities have been excluded from the table above. See
    Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    information regarding our contingent tax liability reserves.

Effects
    of Inflation

Our operations have benefited from relatively low inflation
    rates. Approximately 42 percent of our gross property,
    plant and equipment is at Gas Pipeline and the remainder is at
    other operating units. Gas Pipeline is subject to regulation,
    which limits recovery to historical cost. While amounts in
    excess of historical cost are not recoverable under current FERC
    practices, we anticipate being allowed to recover and earn a
    return based on increased actual cost incurred to replace
    existing assets. Cost-based regulation, along with competition
    and other market factors, may limit our ability to recover such
    increased costs. For the other operating units, operating costs
    are influenced to a greater extent by both competition for
    specialized services and specific price changes in oil and
    natural gas and related commodities than by changes in general
    inflation. Crude, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices
    are particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels

and/or

the
    market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in
    the near future. However, our exposure to these price changes is
    reduced through the use of hedging instruments.

Environmental

We are a participant in certain environmental activities in
    various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations

and/or

remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently
    do not own. (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.) We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated
    effort with other potentially responsible parties, the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other
    governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable
    along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities
    and solely responsible in others. Current estimates of the most
    likely costs of such activities are approximately
    $46 million, all of which are recorded as liabilities on
    our balance sheet at December 31, 2007. We will seek
    recovery of approximately $13 million of the accrued costs
    through future natural gas transmission rates. The remainder of
    these costs will be funded from operations. During 2007, we paid
    approximately $14 million for cleanup

and/or

remediation and monitoring activities. We expect to pay
    approximately $15 million in 2008 for these activities.
    Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally
    based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of
    studies or our experience with other similar cleanup operations.
    At December 31, 2007, certain assessment studies were still
    in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield
    significantly different estimates of most likely costs.
    Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final
    amount, type and extent of contamination discovered at these
    sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other
    governmental authorities, and other factors.

We are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and to the federal
    Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which require the EPA to issue
    new regulations. We are also subject to regulation at the state
    and local level. In September 1998, the EPA promulgated rules
    designed to mitigate the migration of ground-level ozone in
    certain states. In March 2004 and June 2004, the EPA promulgated
    additional regulation regarding hazardous air pollutants, which
    may impose additional controls. Capital expenditures necessary
    to install emission control devices on our Transco gas pipeline
    system to comply with rules were approximately $3 million
    in 2007 and are estimated to be between $25 million and
    $30 million through 2010. The actual costs incurred will
    depend on the final implementation plans developed by each state
    to comply with these regulations. We consider these costs on our
    Transco system associated with compliance with these
    environmental laws and regulations to be prudent costs incurred
    in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, recoverable
    through its rates.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to
    our debt portfolio. The majority of our debt portfolio is
    comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of
    fluctuations in interest rates. The maturity of our long-term
    debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of
    our operating assets.

The tables below provide information about our interest rate
    risk-sensitive instruments as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006. Long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash
    flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest
    rates by expected maturity dates. The fair value of our publicly
    traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded
    bond market prices. Private debt is valued based on the prices
    of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price
    of natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as other market
    factors, such as market volatility and commodity price
    correlations. We are exposed to these risks in connection with
    our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related
    contracts and our proprietary trading activities. We manage the
    risks associated with these market fluctuations using various
    derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. The fair
    value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in
    energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of
    the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes
    in interest rates. We measure the risk in our portfolios using a

value-at-risk

methodology to estimate the potential

one-day

loss
    from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios.



Value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not
    necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that
    could be incurred from the portfolios. Our

value-at-risk

model uses a Monte Carlo method to simulate hypothetical
    movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result
    of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent
    probability that the

one-day

loss
    in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at
    risk. The simulation method uses historical correlations and
    market forward prices and volatilities. In applying the

value-at-risk

methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical
    movements affect the positions or would cause any potential
    liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio
    in response to market conditions could affect market prices and
    could take longer than a

one-day

holding period to execute. While a

one-day

holding period has historically been the industry standard, a
    longer holding period could more accurately represent the true
    market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and
    liquidity constraints.

We segregate our derivative contracts into trading and
    nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. We
    calculate value at risk separately for these two categories.
    Derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales
    under SFAS 133 and nonderivative energy contracts have been
    excluded from our estimation of value at risk.

Trading

Our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered
    into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity
    price-risk exposure. Our value at risk for contracts held for
    trading purposes was approximately $1 million at both
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, our value at risk for these contracts
    ranged from a high of $2 million to a low of
    $1 million.

Nontrading

Our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that
    hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from
    the following activities:

Segment

Commodity Price Risk Exposure

Exploration & Production

•   Natural gas sales

Midstream

•   Natural gas purchases

•   NGL sales

Gas Marketing Services

•   Natural gas purchases and sales

The value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading
    purposes was $24 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $12 million at December 31, 2006. During the year
    ended December 31, 2007, our value at risk for these
    contracts ranged from a high of $24 million to a low of
    $7 million. The increase in value at risk reflects the
    impact on our nontrading portfolio of the sale of substantially
    all of our power business in November 2007.

Certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes
    are accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133.
    Though these contracts are included in our

value-at-risk

calculation, any change in the fair value of these hedge
    contracts would generally not be reflected in earnings until the
    associated hedged item affects earnings.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

We have international investments that could affect our
    financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline
    in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates

and/or

the economic conditions in foreign countries.

International investments accounted for under the cost method
    totaled $24 million at December 31, 2007, and
    $42 million at December 31, 2006. These investments
    are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is
    not practicable to estimate fair value. We believe that we can
    realize the carrying value of these investments considering the
    status of the operations of the companies underlying these
    investments. If a 20 percent change



occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these
    investments against the U.S. dollar, the fair value at
    December 31, 2007, could change by approximately
    $5 million assuming a direct correlation between the
    currency fluctuation and the value of the investments.

Net assets of consolidated foreign operations, whose functional
    currency is the local currency, are located primarily in Canada
    and approximate 7 percent and 6 percent of our net
    assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These
    foreign operations do not have significant transactions or
    financial instruments denominated in other currencies. However,
    these investments do have the potential to impact our financial
    position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising
    from the process of re-measuring the local functional currency
    into the U.S. dollar. As an example, a 20 percent
    change in the respective functional currencies against the
    U.S. dollar could have changed

stockholders’ equity

by approximately $88 million at December 31, 2007.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

Williams’ management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and for the
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to
    provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of
    directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
    financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control
    over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
    that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorization of our management and board of directors; and
    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial
    statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
    respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of Williams’
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Management’s
    assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal
    control over financial reporting and testing of the operational
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
    Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31,
    2007, Williams’ internal control over financial reporting
    is effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial
    reporting, as stated in their report which is included in this
    Annual Report on Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited The Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    The Williams Companies, Inc.’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, The Williams Companies, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of The Williams Companies, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007 of The Williams Companies, Inc. and our
    report dated February 22, 2008 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    The Williams Companies, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of The Williams Companies, Inc. at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As explained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2007 the Company adopted
    FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

. Also, as explained in Note 1 to the
    consolidated financial statements, effective January 1,
    2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The
    Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Description
    of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Operations of our company are located principally in the United
    States and are organized into the following reporting segments:
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream
    Gas & Liquids (Midstream), and Gas Marketing Services
    (Gas Marketing).

Exploration & Production includes natural gas
    development, production and gas management activities primarily
    in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States and oil and natural gas interests in Argentina.

Gas Pipeline is comprised primarily of two interstate natural
    gas pipelines, as well as investments in natural gas
    pipeline-related companies. The Gas Pipeline operating segments
    have been aggregated for reporting purposes and include
    Northwest Pipeline GP (Northwest Pipeline), formerly Northwest
    Pipeline Corporation, which extends from the San Juan basin
    in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado to Oregon
    and Washington, and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation
    (Transco), which extends from the Gulf of Mexico region to the
    northeastern United States. In addition, we own a
    50 percent interest in Gulfstream Natural Gas System L.L.C.
    (Gulfstream). Gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system
    extending from the Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in
    Florida.

Midstream is comprised of natural gas gathering and processing
    and treating facilities in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast
    regions of the United States, oil gathering and transportation
    facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the United States,
    majority-owned natural gas compression facilities in Venezuela,
    and assets in Canada, consisting primarily of a natural gas
    liquids extraction facility and a fractionation plant.

Gas Marketing primarily supports our natural gas businesses by
    providing marketing and risk management services, which include
    marketing and hedging the gas produced by
    Exploration & Production, and procuring fuel and
    shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids sales for Midstream.
    In addition, Gas Marketing manages various natural gas-related
    contracts such as transportation, storage, and related hedges,
    and provides services to third parties, such as producers.

Basis
    of Presentation

In accordance with the provisions related to discontinued
    operations within Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS No. 144),
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes
    reflect the results of operations and financial position of our
    power business as discontinued operations. (See Note 2.)
    These operations include a 7,500-megawatt portfolio of
    power-related contracts that were sold to Bear Energy, LP, a
    unit of The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. and our natural
    gas-fired electric generating plant located in Hazleton,
    Pennsylvania (Hazleton), in addition to other power-related
    assets.

Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing
    operations.

Williams Partners L.P. is a limited partnership engaged in the
    business of gathering, transporting and processing natural gas
    and fractionating and storing natural gas liquids. We currently
    own approximately 23.6 percent of Williams Partners L.P.,
    including the interests of the general partner, which is wholly
    owned by us, and incentive distribution rights. Considering the
    presumption of control of the general partner in accordance with
    Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

No. 04-5,

“Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights,”
    Williams Partners L.P. is consolidated within our Midstream
    segment.

    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    our corporate parent and our majority-owned or controlled
    subsidiaries and investments. We apply the equity method of
    accounting for investments in unconsolidated companies in which
    we and our subsidiaries own 20 to 50 percent of the voting
    interest, or otherwise exercise significant influence over
    operating and financial policies of the company.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Significant estimates and assumptions include:

•

Impairment assessments of investments, long-lived assets and
    goodwill;

•

Litigation-related contingencies;

•

Valuations of derivatives;

•

Environmental remediation obligations;

•

Hedge accounting correlations and probability;

•

Realization of deferred income tax assets;

•

Valuation of Exploration & Production’s reserves;

•

Asset retirement obligations;

•

Pension and postretirement valuation variables.

These estimates are discussed further throughout these notes.

Cash and
    cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents

includes demand and time
    deposits, money market funds, and other marketable securities
    with maturities of three months or less when acquired.

Restricted
    cash

Restricted cash within

current assets

is included in

other current assets and deferred charges

in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet and consists primarily of collateral
    required by certain loan agreements for our Venezuelan
    operations, and escrow accounts established to fund payments
    required by our California settlement. (See Note 15).
    Restricted cash within noncurrent assets is included in

other
    assets and deferred charges

in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet and relates primarily to certain borrowings by our
    Venezuelan operations as previously mentioned and letters of
    credit. We do not expect this cash to be released within the
    next twelve months. The current and noncurrent restricted cash
    is primarily invested in short-term money market accounts with
    financial institutions.

The classification of restricted cash is determined based on the
    expected term of the collateral requirement and not necessarily
    the maturity date of the investment.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Auction
    rate securities

Auction rate securities are instruments with long-term
    underlying maturities, but for which an auction is conducted
    periodically, as specified, to reset the interest rate and allow
    investors to buy or sell the instruments. Because auctions
    generally occur more often than annually, and because we hold
    these investments in order to meet short-term liquidity needs,
    we classify auction rate securities as short-term and include
    them in

other current assets and deferred charges

on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our Consolidated Statement of Cash
    Flows reflects the gross amount of the

purchases of auction
    rate securities

and the

proceeds from sales of auction
    rate securities

.

Accounts
    receivable

Accounts receivable

are carried on a gross basis, with no
    discounting, less the allowance for doubtful accounts. We
    estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on existing
    economic conditions, the financial conditions of the customers
    and the amount and age of past due accounts. Receivables are
    considered past due if full payment is not received by the
    contractual due date. Interest income related to past due
    accounts receivable is generally recognized at the time full
    payment is received or collectibility is assured. Past due
    accounts are generally written off against the allowance for
    doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been
    exhausted.

Inventory
    valuation

All

inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or
    market. We determine the cost of certain natural gas inventories
    held by Transco using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) cost method. We determine the cost of the
    remaining inventories primarily using the average-cost method.

Property,
    plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment

is recorded at
    cost.  We base the carrying value of these assets on
    estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized
    costs, useful lives and salvage values.

As regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco provide
    for depreciation using the straight-line method at Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-prescribed rates.
    Depreciation rates used for major regulated gas plant facilities
    for all years presented, are as follows:

Category of Property

Depreciation Rates

Gathering facilities

.01% - 3.8%

Storage facilities

.15% - 3.3%

Onshore transmission facilities

.15% - 7.25%

Offshore transmission facilities

.01% - 1.5%

General plant

2.95% - 50%

Depreciation for nonregulated entities is provided primarily on
    the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, except as
    noted below for oil and gas exploration and production
    activities. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Estimated

Useful Lives

THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Gains or losses from the ordinary sale or retirement of
    property, plant and equipment for regulated pipelines are
    credited or charged to accumulated depreciation; other gains or
    losses are recorded in

other (income) expense — net

included in

operating income

.

Ordinary maintenance and repair costs are generally expensed as
    incurred. Costs of major renewals and replacements are
    capitalized as

property, plant, and equipment —
    net

.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted
    for under the successful efforts method. Costs incurred in
    connection with the drilling and equipping of exploratory wells,
    as applicable, are capitalized as incurred. If proved reserves
    are not found, such costs are charged to expense. Other
    exploration costs, including lease rentals, are expensed as
    incurred. All costs related to development wells, including
    related production equipment and lease acquisition costs, are
    capitalized when incurred.

Depreciation, depletion and
    amortization

is provided under the units of production
    method on a field basis.

Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition
    costs are assessed annually, or as conditions warrant, and any
    impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with
    acquisition costs that are not individually significant are
    aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be
    nonproductive, based on historical experience or other
    information, is amortized over the average holding period. If
    the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the
    appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas
    properties.

Proved properties, including developed and undeveloped, and
    costs associated with unproven reserves, are assessed for
    impairment using estimated future cash flows on a field basis.
    Estimating future cash flows involves the use of complex
    judgments such as estimation of the proved and unproven oil and
    gas reserve quantities, risk associated with the different
    categories of oil and gas reserves, timing of development and
    production, expected future commodity prices, capital
    expenditures, and production costs.

We record an asset and a liability upon incurrence equal to the
    present value of each expected future asset retirement
    obligation (ARO). The ARO asset is depreciated in a manner
    consistent with the depreciation of the underlying physical
    asset. We measure changes in the liability due to passage of
    time by applying an interest method of allocation. This amount
    is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the
    liability and as a corresponding accretion expense included in

other (income) expense — net

included in

operating income

, except for regulated entities, for
    which the liability is offset by a regulatory asset.

Goodwill

Goodwill

represents the excess of cost over fair value of
    the assets of businesses acquired. It is evaluated annually for
    impairment by first comparing our management’s estimate of
    the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value,
    including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
    exceeds its fair value, a computation of the implied fair value
    of the goodwill is compared with its related carrying value. If
    the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the
    implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
    recognized in the amount of the excess. We have

goodwill

of approximately $1 billion at December 31, 2007,
    and 2006, at our Exploration & Production segment.

When a reporting unit is sold or classified as held for sale,
    any goodwill of that reporting unit is included in its carrying
    value for purposes of determining any impairment or gain/loss on
    sale. If a portion of a reporting unit with goodwill is sold or
    classified as held for sale and that asset group represents a
    business, a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill is
    allocated to and included in the carrying value of that asset
    group. None of the operations sold during 2007 or 2005
    represented reporting units with goodwill or businesses within
    reporting units to which goodwill was required to be allocated.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
    estimate of undiscounted future cash flows used to determine the
    estimate of the reporting unit’s fair value. The use of
    alternate judgments

and/or

assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels
    of impairment charges in the financial statements.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Treasury
    stock

Treasury stock

purchases are accounted for under the cost
    method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded
    as treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance
    of shares are credited or charged to

capital in excess of par
    value

using the average-cost method.

Derivative
    instruments and hedging activities

We utilize derivatives to manage our commodity price risk. These
    instruments consist primarily of futures contracts, swap
    agreements, option contracts, and forward contracts involving
    short- and long-term purchases and sales of a physical energy
    commodity. We execute most of these transactions on an organized
    commodity exchange or in over-the-counter markets in which
    quoted prices exist for active periods. For contracts with terms
    that exceed the time period for which actively quoted prices are
    available, we determine fair value by estimating commodity
    prices during the illiquid periods utilizing internally
    developed valuations incorporating information obtained from
    commodity prices in actively quoted markets, quoted prices in
    less active markets, prices reflected in current transactions,
    and other market fundamental analysis.

We report the fair value of derivatives, except for those for
    which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has been
    elected, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in

derivative
    assets

and

derivative liabilities

as either current
    or noncurrent. We determine the current and noncurrent
    classification based on the timing of expected future cash flows
    of individual contracts.

The accounting for changes in the fair value of a commodity
    derivative is governed by SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” (SFAS No. 133), as amended and
    depends on whether the derivative has been designated in a
    hedging relationship and whether we have elected the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception. The accounting for the
    change in fair value can be summarized as follows:

Derivative Treatment

Accounting Method

Normal purchases and normal sales exception

Accrual accounting

Designated in a qualifying hedging relationship

Hedge accounting

All other derivatives

Mark-to-market accounting

We may elect the normal purchases and normal sales exception for
    certain short- and long-term purchases and sales of a physical
    energy commodity. Under accrual accounting, any change in the
    fair value of these derivatives is not reflected on the balance
    sheet after the initial election of the exception.

We have also designated a hedging relationship for certain
    commodity derivatives. For a derivative to qualify for
    designation in a hedging relationship, it must meet specific
    criteria and we must maintain appropriate documentation. We
    establish hedging relationships pursuant to our risk management
    policies. We evaluate the hedging relationships at the inception
    of the hedge and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the
    hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly
    effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash
    flows attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. We also
    regularly assess whether the hedged forecasted transaction is
    probable of occurring. If a derivative ceases to be or is no
    longer expected to be highly effective, or if we believe the
    likelihood of occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction is
    no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued
    prospectively, and future changes in the fair value of the
    derivative are recognized currently in

revenues

.

For commodity derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is reported in

other comprehensive income (loss)

and
    reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged
    item affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of the
    derivative’s change in fair value is recognized currently
    in

revenues

. Gains or losses deferred in

accumulated
    other comprehensive loss

associated with terminated
    derivatives, derivatives that cease to be highly effective
    hedges, derivatives for which the forecasted transaction is
    reasonably possible but no longer probable of occurring, and
    cash flow hedges that have been otherwise



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

discontinued remain in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

until the hedged item affects earnings. If it becomes
    probable that the forecasted transaction designated as the
    hedged item in a cash flow hedge will not occur, any gain or
    loss deferred in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

is
    recognized in

revenues

at that time. The change in
    likelihood is a judgmental decision that includes qualitative
    assessments made by management.

For commodity derivatives that are not designated in a hedging
    relationship, and for which we have not elected the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception, we report changes in fair
    value currently in

revenues

.

Certain gains and losses on derivative instruments included in
    the Consolidated Statement of Income are netted together to a
    single net gain or loss, while other gains and losses are
    reported on a gross basis. Gains and losses recorded on a net
    basis include:

•

Unrealized gains and losses on all derivatives that are not
    designated as hedges and for which we have not elected the
    normal purchases and normal sales exception;

•

The ineffective portion of unrealized gains and losses on
    derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges;

•

Realized gains and losses on all derivatives that settle
    financially;

•

Realized gains and losses on derivatives held for trading
    purposes;

•

Realized gains and losses on derivatives entered into as a
    pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement.

Realized gains and losses on derivatives that require physical
    delivery, and which are not held for trading purposes nor were
    entered into as a pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement, are
    recorded on a gross basis. In reaching our conclusions on this
    presentation, we evaluated the indicators in EITF Issue

No. 99-19

“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus as an
    Agent,” including whether we act as principal in the
    transaction; whether we have the risks and rewards of ownership,
    including credit risk; and whether we have latitude in
    establishing prices.

Gas
    Pipeline revenues

Revenues from the transportation of gas are recognized in the
    period the service is provided, and revenues for sales of
    products are recognized in the period of delivery. Gas Pipeline
    is subject to FERC regulations and, accordingly, certain
    revenues collected may be subject to possible refunds upon final
    orders in pending rate cases. Gas Pipeline records estimates of
    rate refund liabilities considering Gas Pipeline and other
    third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and
    estimated total exposure, as discounted and risk weighted, as
    well as collection and other risks.

Exploration &
    Production revenues

Revenues from the domestic production of natural gas in
    properties for which Exploration & Production has an
    interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual
    volumes sold during the period. Any differences between volumes
    sold and entitlement volumes, based on Exploration &
    Production’s net working interest, that are determined to
    be nonrecoverable through remaining production are recognized as
    accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate.
    Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement
    volumes are not significant.

All other
    revenues

Revenues generally are recorded when services are performed or
    products have been delivered.

Impairment
    of long-lived assets and investments

We evaluate the long-lived assets of identifiable business
    activities for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate, in our management’s judgment, that
    the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When
    an indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our
    management’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
    attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets
    to determine whether an impairment has occurred. We apply a
    probability-weighted approach to consider the likelihood of
    different cash flow assumptions and possible outcomes including
    selling in the near term or holding for the remaining estimated
    useful life. If an impairment of the carrying value has
    occurred, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized
    in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the
    assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying
    value exceeds the estimated fair value.

For assets identified to be disposed of in the future and
    considered held for sale in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, we compare the carrying value to the
    estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if
    recognition of an impairment is required. Until the assets are
    disposed of, the estimated fair value, which includes estimated
    cash flows from operations until the assumed date of sale, is
    recalculated when related events or circumstances change.

We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate, in our management’s
    judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have
    experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When
    evidence of loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate
    of fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the
    investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. If
    the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and we
    consider the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the
    excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized
    in the consolidated financial statements as an impairment.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
    estimate of undiscounted future cash flows and an asset’s
    fair value. Additionally, judgment is used to determine the
    probability of sale with respect to assets considered for
    disposal. The use of alternate judgments

and/or

assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels
    of impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements.

Capitalization
    of interest

We capitalize interest during construction on major projects
    with construction periods of at least three months and a total
    project cost in excess of $1 million. Interest is
    capitalized on borrowed funds and, where regulation by the FERC
    exists, on internally generated funds as a component of

other
    income — net

. The rates used by regulated
    companies are calculated in accordance with FERC rules. Rates
    used by unregulated companies are based on the average interest
    rate on debt. The benefit of interest capitalized on internally
    generated funds for regulated entities is reported in

other
    income — net

Employee
    stock-based awards

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based
    awards to employees and nonmanagement directors (see
    Note 13) under the recognition and measurement
    provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” and related interpretations, as permitted by
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation” (SFAS No. 123). Compensation cost
    for stock options was not recognized in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income for the years prior to 2006 as all options
    granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    underlying common stock on the date of the grant. Prior to
    January 1, 2006, compensation cost was recognized for
    restricted stock units. Effective January 1, 2006, we
    adopted the fair



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)),
    using the modified-prospective method. Under this method,
    compensation cost recognized in periods subsequent to
    December 31, 2005, includes: (1) compensation cost for
    all share-based payments granted through December 31, 2005,
    but for which the requisite service period had not been
    completed as of December 31, 2005, based on the grant date
    fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, and (2) compensation cost for most
    share-based payments granted subsequent to December 31,
    2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The
    performance targets for certain performance-based restricted
    stock units have not been established and therefore expense is
    not currently recognized. Expense associated with these
    performance-based awards will be recognized in future periods
    when performance targets are established. Results for prior
    periods have not been restated.

Total stock-based compensation expense for the years ending
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, was $70 million and
    $44 million, respectively, of which $9 million and
    $3 million, respectively, is included in

income (loss)
    from discontinued operations

. The 2006 amount reflects a
    reduction of $.3 million of previously recognized
    compensation cost for restricted stock units related to the
    estimated number of awards expected to be forfeited. This
    adjustment is not considered material for reporting as a
    cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Measured
    but unrecognized stock-based compensation expense at
    December 31, 2007, was approximately $62 million,
    which does not include the effect of estimated forfeitures of
    $3 million. This amount is comprised of approximately
    $7 million related to stock options and approximately
    $55 million related to restricted stock units. These
    amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of 1.9 years.

The following table illustrates the effect on

net income

and

earnings per common share

for the year ending
    December 31, 2005, if we had applied the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to options
    granted. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the value of
    the options was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model and amortized to expense over the vesting period of the
    options.

includes any dilutive effect of stock
    options, nonvested restricted stock units and, for applicable
    periods presented, convertible debt, unless otherwise noted.

Foreign
    currency translation

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries and equity method investees
    use their local currency as their functional currency. These
    foreign currencies include the Canadian dollar, British pound
    and Euro. Assets and liabilities of certain foreign subsidiaries
    and equity investees are translated at the spot rate in effect
    at the applicable reporting date, and the combined statements of
    operations and our share of the results of operations of our
    equity affiliates are translated into the U.S. dollar at
    the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable
    period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is
    recorded as a separate component of

other comprehensive
    income (loss)

.

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
    currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such
    transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result
    in transaction gains and losses which are reflected in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income.

Issuance
    of equity of consolidated subsidiary

Sales of residual equity interests in a consolidated subsidiary
    are accounted for as capital transactions. No adjustments to
    capital are made for sales of preferential interests in a
    subsidiary. No gain or loss is recognized on these transactions.

Recent
    Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157).
    This Statement establishes a framework for fair value
    measurements in the financial statements by providing a
    definition of fair value, provides guidance on the methods used
    to estimate fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008,
    the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)

No. FAS 157-2,

permitting entities to delay application of
    SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed
    at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis
    (at least annually). SFAS No. 157 requires two
    distinct transition approaches; (i) cumulative-effect
    adjustment to beginning retained earnings for certain financial
    instrument transactions and (ii) prospectively as of the
    date of adoption through earnings or other comprehensive income,
    as applicable. On January 1, 2008, we partially applied
    SFAS No. 157 through a prospective transition for our
    assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis, primarily our commodity derivatives, with no
    material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We did
    not have financial instrument transactions that required a
    cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings upon
    the adoption of SFAS No. 157. Beginning
    January 1, 2009, we will apply SFAS No. 157 fair value
    requirements to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
    that are not recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis.
    SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures about assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
    effective beginning with first-quarter 2008 reporting.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159).
    SFAS No. 159 establishes a fair value option
    permitting entities to elect to measure eligible financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair

    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair
    value option has been elected will be reported in earnings. The
    fair value option may be applied on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis, is irrevocable and is applied to the entire instrument.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of the
    first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007, and
    should not be applied retrospectively to fiscal years beginning
    prior to the effective date. On the adoption date, an entity may
    elect the fair value option for eligible items existing at that
    date and the adjustment for the initial remeasurement of those
    items to fair value should be reported as a cumulative effect
    adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
    Subsequent to January 1, 2008, the fair value option can
    only be elected when a financial instrument or certain other
    item is entered into. On January 1, 2008, we did not elect
    the fair value option for any existing eligible financial
    instruments or certain other items.

In April 2007, the FASB issued an FSP on a previously issued
    FASB Interpretation (FIN), FSP

FIN 39-1,

“Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39.” FSP

FIN 39-1

amends FIN 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to
    Certain Contracts (as amended)” by requiring the offsetting
    of fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim or
    obligation to return cash collateral if the related derivative
    instruments have been offset pursuant to a master netting
    arrangement. The FSP requires disclosure of the accounting
    policy related to offsetting fair value amounts pursuant to
    master netting arrangements as well as disclosure of amounts
    recognized for the right to reclaim or obligation to return cash
    collateral. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007, with early application permitted,
    and is applied retrospectively as a change in accounting
    principle for all financial statements presented. We do not
    offset derivative instruments subject to master netting
    arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes;
    therefore, there is no change to our accounting policy and no
    financial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

No. 06-11

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards”

(EITF 06-11).

EITF 06-11

requires that the income tax benefits received on dividends or
    dividend equivalents paid to employees holding equity-classified
    nonvested shares be recorded as additional paid-in capital when
    the dividends or dividend equivalents are charged to retained
    earnings pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). This EITF is
    applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those years.

EITF 06-11

requires the disclosure of any change in accounting policy for
    income tax benefits of dividends or dividend equivalents on
    share-based payment awards as a result of adoption. We began
    applying the provisions of

EITF 06-11

on January 1, 2008 with no material impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R)
    “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141(R)).
    SFAS No. 141(R) applies to all business combinations
    and establishes guidance for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed,
    noncontrolling interests in the acquiree and goodwill. Most of
    these items are recognized at their full fair value on the
    acquisition date, including acquisitions where the acquirer
    obtains control but less than 100 percent ownership in the
    acquiree. SFAS No. 141(R) also requires expensing of
    transaction costs as incurred and establishes disclosure
    requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and
    financial effects of the business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations
    with an acquisition date in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51” (SFAS No. 160).
    SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards for noncontrolling ownership interests in subsidiaries
    (previously referred to as minority interests). Noncontrolling
    ownership interests in consolidated subsidiaries will be
    presented in the consolidated balance sheet within
    stockholders’ equity as a separate component from the
    parent’s equity. Earnings attributable to the
    noncontrolling interests will be reported as a part of
    consolidated net income and not as a separate income or expense
    item. Earnings per share will continue to be based on earnings
    attributable to only the parent company and does not change upon
    adoption of SFAS No. 160. SFAS No. 160
    provides guidance on accounting for changes in the parent’s
    ownership interest in a subsidiary, including transactions where
    control is retained and where control is relinquished.
    SFAS No. 160 also requires additional disclosure of
    information related to



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

noncontrolling interests. SFAS No. 160 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and
    early adoption is prohibited. The Statement will be applied
    prospectively to transactions involving noncontrolling
    interests, including noncontrolling interests that arose prior
    to the effective date, as of the beginning of the fiscal year it
    is initially adopted. However, the presentation of
    noncontrolling interests within stockholders’ equity and
    the inclusion of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling
    interests in consolidated net income requires retrospective
    application to all periods presented. We will assess the impact
    on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 2.

Discontinued
    Operations

The businesses discussed below represent components that have
    been sold or approved for sale by our Board of Directors and are
    classified as discontinued operations. Therefore, their results
    of operations (including any impairments, gains or losses) and
    financial position have been reflected in the consolidated
    financial statements and notes as discontinued operations.

In November, 2007, we completed the sale of substantially all of
    our power business to Bear Energy, LP, a unit of The Bear
    Stearns Companies, Inc., for approximately $496 million in
    cash, subject to the final purchase price adjustments. Included
    in the sale was our portfolio of power-related contracts, which
    consisted of tolling contracts, full requirement contracts,
    tolling resales, heat rate options, related hedges and other
    related assets.

Summarized
    Results of Discontinued Operations

of
    discontinued operations) associated with the reclassification of
    deferred net hedge gains from

accumulated other comprehensive
    income

to earnings in second-quarter 2007. This
    reclassification was based on the determination that the
    forecasted transactions related to the derivative cash flow
    hedges being sold to Bear Energy, LP, were probable of not
    occurring. This gain is partially offset by current year
    unrealized mark-to-market losses of approximately
    $23 million.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations
    before income taxes

for the year ended December 31,
    2006, includes charges of $19 million for an adverse

    business, $6 million for a loss contingency in connection
    with a former exploration business, and $15 million
    associated with an oil purchase contract related to our former

    approximately $111 million related to the carrying value of
    certain derivative contracts for which we had previously elected
    the normal purchases and normal sales exception under
    SFAS No. 133, and, accordingly, were no longer

Utilization of foreign operating loss carryovers reduced the
    provision for income taxes by $5 million, $3 million
    and $13 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes and
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

includes
    $169 million, $144 million, and $72 million of
    international income in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

We provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method
    as required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes.” As a result of additional analysis of our
    tax basis and book basis assets and liabilities, we recorded a
    tax provision of $2 million and $7 million for 2007
    and 2006, respectively, and a tax benefit of $20 million in
    2005, to adjust the overall deferred income tax liabilities on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

During the course of audits of our business by domestic and
    foreign tax authorities, we frequently face challenges regarding
    the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions
    regarding the timing and amount

of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax
    jurisdictions. In evaluating the liability associated with our
    various tax filing positions, we apply the two-step process of
    recognition and measurement as required by FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
    an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (FIN 48). In association with this liability, we record an
    estimate of related interest and tax exposure as a component of
    our tax provision. The impact of this accrual is included within

The

valuation allowance

at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, serves to reduce the recognized tax
    benefit associated with foreign carryovers to an amount that
    will, more likely than not, be realized. We do not expect to be
    able to utilize our $57 million foreign deferred tax assets
    primarily related to carryovers.

Undistributed earnings of certain consolidated foreign
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2007, totaled approximately
    $262 million. No provision for deferred U.S. income
    taxes has been made for these subsidiaries because we intend to
    permanently reinvest such earnings in foreign operations.

Cash payments for income taxes (net of refunds) were
    $384 million, $79 million, and $230 million in
    2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Cash tax payments include
    settlements with taxing authorities associated with prior period
    audits of $94 million, $42 million, and
    $204 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and, as
    required by the Interpretation, recognized the net impact of the
    cumulative effect of adoption as a $17 million increase to

accumulated deficit

. The Interpretation prescribes
    guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement
    of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    To recognize a tax position, the enterprise determines whether
    it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related
    appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits
    of the position. A tax position that meets the more likely than
    not recognition threshold

is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in
    the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the
    largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative
    probability basis, that is greater than 50 percent likely
    of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    $76 million of unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized,
    approximately $64 million, net of federal tax expense,
    would be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense. A

    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

We recognize related interest and penalties as a component of
    income tax expense. During 2007, approximately $60 million
    of interest and penalties were included in the provision for
    income taxes. As of December 31, 2007, approximately
    $86 million of interest and penalties primarily relating to
    uncertain tax positions have been accrued.

As of December 31, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    examination of our consolidated U.S. income tax return for
    2002 through 2005 was in process. IRS examinations for 1996
    through 2001 have been completed but the years remain open while
    certain issues are under review with the Appeals Division of the
    IRS. The statute of limitations for most states expires one year
    after IRS audit settlement.

Generally, tax returns for our Venezuela and Canadian entities
    are open to audit from 2003 through 2007. Tax returns for our
    Argentine entities are open to audit from 2001 through 2007.
    Certain Canadian entities are currently under examination.

During the next twelve months, we do not expect settlement of
    any unrecognized tax benefit associated with domestic or
    international matters under audit to have a material impact on
    our financial position.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in which
    all eligible employees participate. Currently, eligible
    employees earn benefits primarily based on a cash balance
    formula. Various other formulas, as defined in the plan
    documents, are utilized to calculate the retirement benefits for
    plan participants not covered by the cash balance formula. At
    the time of retirement, participants may receive annuity
    payments, a lump sum payment or a combination of lump sum and
    annuity payments. In addition to our pension plans, we currently
    provide subsidized



THE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

medical and life insurance benefits (other postretirement
    benefits) to certain eligible participants. Generally, employees
    hired after December 31, 1991, are not eligible for the
    subsidized medical benefits, except for participants that were
    employees of Transco Energy Company on December 31, 1995,
    and other miscellaneous defined participant groups. Certain of
    these other postretirement benefit plans, particularly the
    subsidized medical benefit plans, provide for retiree
    contributions and contain other cost-sharing features such as
    deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance. The accounting for
    these plans anticipates future cost-sharing that is consistent
    with our expressed intent to increase the retiree contribution
    level generally in line with health care cost increases.

The following table presents the changes in benefit obligations

The plan assets within our other postretirement benefit plans
    are intended to be used for the payment of benefits for certain
    groups of participants. The

current liabilities

for the
    other postretirement benefit plans represent the actuarial
    present value of benefits included in the benefit obligation
    payable in the subsequent year for the groups of participants
    whose benefits are not expected to be paid from plan assets.

The 2007

actuarial gain

of $48 million for our
    pension plans included in the table of changes in benefit
    obligation is due primarily to the impact of changes in the
    discount rate assumptions utilized to calculate the benefit
    obligation. The 2006

actuarial loss

of $13 million
    for our pension plans included in the table of changes in
    benefit obligation is due primarily to the impact of actual
    results differing from assumed results such as compensation and
    participant deaths, offset by the net impact of changes in
    assumptions utilized to calculate the benefit obligation
    including the discount rate, mortality and expected form of
    benefit payments. The 2007

actuarial gain

of
    $30 million for our other postretirement benefit plans
    included in the table of changes in benefit obligation is due
    primarily to the impact of the increase in the discount rate
    used to calculate the benefit obligation and a decrease in the
    number of eligible participants in the plan. The 2006

actuarial gain

of $64 million for our other
    postretirement benefit plans included in the table of changes in
    benefit obligation is due primarily to the impact of changes in
    assumptions utilized to calculate the benefit obligation
    including claims costs, health care cost trend rates and the
    discount rate, as well as actual results differing from assumed
    results such as participant deaths and terminations prior to
    retirement.

The current accounting rules for the determination of

net
    periodic benefit expense

allow for the delayed recognition
    of gains and losses caused by differences between actual and
    assumed outcomes for items such as estimated return on plan
    assets, or caused by changes in assumptions for items such as
    discount rates or estimated future compensation levels. The

THE

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The error was associated with the actuarial computation of
    annual

net periodic benefit expense (income)

which
    resulted from the identification of errors in certain Transco
    participant data involving annuity contract information utilized
    for 2003 and 2004. The adjustment is reflected as
    $16 million within

amortization of net actuarial (gain)
    loss

and $1 million within

regulatory asset
    amortization.

The differences in the amount of actuarially determined

net
    periodic benefit expense

for our other postretirement
    benefit plans and the other postretirement benefit costs
    recovered in rates for our FERC-regulated gas pipelines are
    deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. At
    December 31, 2007, we have regulatory liabilities of
    $10 million for Transco and $18 million for Northwest
    Pipeline related to these deferrals. At December 31, 2006,
    we had a regulatory asset of $9 million for Transco and a
    regulatory liability of $13 million at Northwest Pipeline
    related to these deferrals. These amounts will be reflected in
    future rates based on Transco and Northwest Pipeline’s rate
    structures.

The discount rates for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans were determined separately based on an approach
    specific to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash
    flows. The plans were analyzed and the year-end discount rates
    were determined based on a yield curve comprised of high-quality
    corporate bonds published by a large securities firm.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were
    determined by combining a review of the historical returns
    realized within the portfolio, the investment strategy included
    in the plans’ Investment Policy Statement, and capital
    market projections for the asset classifications in which the
    portfolio is invested and the target weightings of each asset
    classification.

The mortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for
    our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are related
    to the experience of the plans and the best estimate of expected
    plan mortality. The selected mortality tables are among the most
    recent tables available.

Plan
    Assets

The investment policy for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans articulates an investment philosophy in accordance
    with ERISA which governs the investment of the assets in a
    diversified portfolio. The investment strategy for the assets of
    the pension plans and approximately one half of the assets of
    the other postretirement benefit plans include maximizing
    returns with reasonable and prudent levels of risk. The
    investment returns on the approximate one half of remaining
    assets of the other postretirement benefit plans is subject to
    federal income tax, therefore the investment strategy also
    includes investing in a tax efficient manner.

The following table presents the weighted-average asset
    allocations at December 31, 2007, and 2006 and target asset
    allocation at December 31, 2007, by asset category.

Included in equity securities are investments in commingled
    funds that invest entirely in equity securities and comprise
    40 percent at December 31, 2007, and 38 percent
    at December 31, 2006, of the pension plans’
    weighted-average assets, and 29 percent at
    December 31, 2007, and 27 percent at December 31,
    2006, of the other postretirement benefit plans’
    weighted-average assets. Other assets are comprised primarily of
    cash and cash equivalents.

The assets are invested in accordance with the target
    allocations identified in the previous table. The investment
    policy provides for minimum and maximum ranges for the broad
    asset classes in the previous table. Additional target
    allocations are identified for specific classes of equity
    securities. The asset allocation ranges established by the
    investment policy are based upon a long-term investment
    perspective. The ranges are more heavily weighted toward equity
    securities since the liabilities of the pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans are long-term in nature and
    historically equity securities have significantly outperformed
    other asset classes over long periods of time.

Equity security investments are restricted to high-quality,
    readily marketable securities that are actively traded on the
    major U.S. and foreign national exchanges. Investment in
    Williams’ securities or an entity in which Williams has a
    majority ownership is prohibited except where these securities
    may be owned in a commingled investment vehicle in which the
    pension plans’ trust invests. No more than five percent of
    the total stock portfolio valued at market may be invested in
    the common stock of any one corporation. The following
    securities and transactions are not authorized: unregistered
    securities, commodities or commodity contracts, short sales or
    margin transactions or other leveraging strategies. Investment
    strategies using options or futures are not authorized.

Debt security investments are restricted to high-quality,
    marketable securities that include U.S. Treasury, federal
    agencies and U.S. Government guaranteed obligations, and
    investment grade corporate issues. The overall

rating of the debt security assets is required to be at least
    “A”, according to the Moody’s or
    Standard & Poor’s rating system. No more than
    five percent of the total portfolio at the time of purchase may
    be invested in the debt securities of any one issuer.
    U.S. Government guaranteed and agency securities are exempt
    from this provision.

During 2007, 11 active investment managers and one passive
    investment manager managed substantially all of the pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans’ funds, each of whom had
    responsibility for managing a specific portion of these assets.

Plan
    Benefit Payments and Employer Contributions

The following are the expected benefits to be paid by the plan
    and the expected federal prescription drug subsidy to be
    received in the next ten years. These estimates are based on the
    same assumptions previously discussed and reflect future service
    as appropriate. The actuarial assumptions are based on long-term
    expectations and include, but are not limited to, assumptions as
    to average expected retirement age and form of benefit payment.
    Actual benefit payments could differ significantly from expected
    benefit payments if near-term participant behaviors differ
    significantly from the actuarial assumptions.

We expect to contribute approximately $41 million to our
    pension plans and approximately $15 million to our other
    postretirement benefit plans in 2008.

Defined
    Contribution Plans

We also maintain defined contribution plans for the benefit of
    substantially all of our employees. Generally, plan participants
    may contribute a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax and
    after-tax basis in accordance with the plan’s guidelines.
    We match employees’ contributions up to certain limits.
    Costs recognized for these plans were $22 million in 2007,
    $19 million in 2006, and $17 million in 2005. One of
    our defined contribution plans was amended as of July 1,
    2005, to convert one of the funds within the plan to a
    nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). The 2005
    compensation cost related to the ESOP of $1 million is
    included in the $17 million of contributions, previously
    mentioned above, and represents the contribution made in
    consideration for employee services rendered in 2005. It is
    measured by the amount of cash contributed to the ESOP. The
    shares held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding when
    computing earnings per share and the dividends on the shares
    held by the ESOP are recorded as a component of retained
    earnings. For 2006 and future years, there were and will be no
    contributions to this ESOP, other than dividend reinvestment, as
    contributions for purchase of our stock is now restricted within
    this defined contribution plan.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

The asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2007 and
    2006 is $399 million and $333 million, respectively.
    The increases in the obligation in 2007 are due to revisions in
    our estimation of our asset retirement obligation in our
    Midstream segment, increased asset additions in our Exploration
    and Production segment and increased accretion in our Gas
    Pipeline segment. The increases in the obligation in 2006 were
    due primarily to obtaining additional information that revised
    our estimation of our asset retirement obligation for certain
    assets in our Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline,
    and Midstream segments. Factors affected by the additional
    information included estimated settlement dates, estimated
    settlement costs, and inflation rates.

The accrued obligations relate to producing wells, underground
    storage caverns, offshore platforms, fractionation facilities,
    gas gathering well connections and pipelines, and gas
    transmission facilities. At the end of the useful life of each
    respective asset, we are legally obligated to plug both
    producing wells and storage caverns and remove any related
    surface equipment, remove surface equipment and restore land at
    fractionation facilities, to dismantle offshore platforms, to
    cap certain gathering pipelines at the wellhead connection and
    remove any related surface equipment, and to remove certain
    components of gas transmission facilities from the ground.

We have an unsecured, $1.5 billion revolving credit
    facility with a maturity date of May 1, 2012. Northwest
    Pipeline and Transco each have access to $400 million under
    the facility to the extent not otherwise utilized by us.
    Interest is calculated based on a choice of two methods: a
    fluctuating rate equal to the lender’s base rate plus an
    applicable margin or a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus
    an applicable margin. We are required to pay a commitment fee
    (currently 0.125 percent) based on the unused portion of
    the facility. The margins and commitment fee are generally based
    on the specific borrower’s senior unsecured long-term debt
    ratings. Significant financial covenants under the credit
    agreement include the following:

•

Our ratio of debt to capitalization must be no greater than
    65 percent. At December 31, 2007, we are in compliance
    with this covenant as our ratio of debt to capitalization, as
    calculated under this covenant, is approximately 51 percent.

•

Ratio of debt to capitalization must be no greater than
    55 percent for Northwest Pipeline and Transco. At
    December 31, 2007, we are in compliance with this covenant
    as our ratio of debt to capitalization, as calculated under this
    covenant, is approximately 36 percent for Northwest
    Pipeline and 31 percent for Transco.

Our $500 million and $700 million facilities provide
    for both borrowings and issuing letters of credit but are
    expected to be used primarily for issuing letters of credit.
    These facilities mature in 2009 and 2010, respectively. We are
    required to pay the funding bank fixed fees at a
    weighted-average interest rate of 3.64 percent and
    2.29 percent for the $500 million and
    $700 million facilities, respectively, on the total
    committed amount of the facilities. In addition, we pay interest
    on any borrowings at a fluctuating rate comprised of either a
    base rate or LIBOR.

The funding bank syndicated its associated credit risk through a
    private offering that allows for the resale of certain
    restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers. To
    facilitate the syndication of these facilities, the bank
    established trusts funded by the institutional investors. The
    assets of the trusts serve as collateral to reimburse the bank
    for our borrowings in the event that the facilities are
    delivered to the investors as described below. Thus, we have no
    asset securitization or collateral requirements under the
    facilities. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events,
    letters of credit under the agreement become cash collateralized
    creating a borrowing under the facilities. Concurrently, the
    funding bank can deliver the facilities to the institutional
    investors, whereby the investors replace the funding bank as
    lender under the facilities. Upon such occurrence, we will pay:

In December 2007, Williams Partners L.P. acquired certain of our
    membership interests in Wamsutter LLC, the limited liability
    company that owns the Wamsutter system, from us for
    $750 million. Williams Partners L.P completed the
    transaction after successfully closing a public equity offering
    of 9.25 million common units that yielded net proceeds of
    approximately $335 million. The partnership financed the
    remainder of the purchase price primarily through utilizing
    $250 million of term loan borrowings and issuing
    approximately $157 million of common units to us. The
    $250 million term loan is under Williams Partners
    L.P.’s new $450 million five-year senior unsecured
    credit facility that became effective simultaneous with the
    closing of the Wamsutter transaction. This $450 million
    credit facility is comprised initially of a $200 million
    revolving credit facility available for borrowings and letters
    of credit and a $250 million term loan. Under certain
    conditions, the revolving credit facility may be increased up to
    an additional $100 million. Interest on borrowings under
    this agreement will be payable at rates per annum equal to
    either (1) a fluctuating base rate equal to the
    lender’s prime rate plus the applicable margin, or
    (2) a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus the
    applicable margin. At December 31, 2007, there were no
    amounts outstanding under the $200 million revolving credit
    facility.

In December 2007, Northwest Pipeline borrowed $250 million
    under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to retire
    its $250 million 6.625 percent notes that matured on

Exploration &
    Production’s credit agreement

In February 2007, Exploration & Production entered
    into a five-year unsecured credit agreement with certain banks
    in order to reduce margin requirements related to our hedging
    activities as well as lower transaction fees. Under the credit
    agreement, Exploration & Production is not required to
    post collateral as long as the value of its domestic natural gas
    reserves, as determined under the provisions of the agreement,
    exceeds by a specified amount certain of its obligations
    including any outstanding debt and the aggregate
    out-of-the-money positions on hedges entered into under the
    credit agreement. Exploration & Production is subject
    to additional covenants under the credit agreement including
    restrictions on hedge limits, the creation of liens, the
    incurrence of debt, the sale of assets and properties, and
    making certain payments, such as dividends, under certain
    circumstances.

Issuances
    and retirements

On May 28, 2003, we issued $300 million of
    5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures due
    2033. These notes, which are callable after seven years, are
    convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at
    a conversion price of approximately $10.89 per share. In
    November 2005, we initiated an offer to convert these debentures
    to shares of our common stock. In January 2006, we converted
    approximately $220 million of the debentures. (See
    Note 12.)

In June 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired 25.1 percent
    of our interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $360 million. The acquisition was completed after Williams
    Partners L.P. successfully closed a $150 million private
    debt offering of 7.5 percent senior unsecured notes due
    2011 and a public equity offering of approximately
    $225 million in net proceeds.

In December 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired the remaining
    74.9 percent interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $1.223 billion. The acquisition was completed after
    Williams Partners L.P. successfully closed a $600 million
    private debt offering of 7.25 percent senior unsecured
    notes due 2017, a private equity offering of approximately
    $350 million of common and Class B units, and a public
    equity offering of approximately $294 million in net
    proceeds.

In connection with the issuance of the $150 million
    7.5 percent notes and the $600 million
    7.25 percent notes discussed above, Williams Partners L.P.
    entered into registration rights agreements with the initial
    purchasers of the senior unsecured notes. In these agreements
    they agreed to conduct a registered exchange offer for the
    senior unsecured notes or cause to become effective a shelf
    registration statement providing for resale of the senior
    unsecured notes. Williams Partners L.P. initiated exchange
    offers for both series on April 10, 2007. The exchange
    offers were completed and closed on May 11, 2007.

In connection with the issuance of approximately
    $350 million of common and Class B units in a private
    equity offering discussed above, Williams Partners L.P. entered
    into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers
    whereby Williams Partners L.P. agreed to file a shelf
    registration statement providing for the resale of the common
    units purchased. Additionally, the registration rights agreement
    provides for the registration of common units that would be
    issued upon conversion of the Class B units. Williams
    Partners L.P. filed the shelf registration statement on
    January 12, 2007, and it became effective on March 13,
    2007. On May 21, 2007, Williams Partners L.P.’s
    outstanding Class B units were converted into common units
    on a one-for-one basis. If the shelf registration

    of 30 days in any

90-day

period or 105 days in any

365-day

period, the purchasers are entitled to receive liquidated
    damages. Liquidated damages are calculated as 0.25 percent
    of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per

period for the first 60 days following the 90th day,
    increasing by an additional 0.25 percent of the Liquidated

    1.00 percent of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per

30-day

period, provided the aggregate amount of liquidated damages
    payable to any purchaser is capped at 10 percent of the
    Liquidated Damages Multiplier. The Liquidated Damages Multiplier
    is (i) the product of $36.59 times the number of common
    units purchased plus (ii) the product of $35.81 times the
    number of Class B units purchased. Due to amendments made
    to Rule 144 of the Securities Act in February 2008,
    related to securities acquired by

non-affiliates

from an issuer subject to public reporting requirements,
    Williams Partners L.P. no longer has an obligation to keep their
    shelf registration statement effective and would have no
    liability for a failure to do so.

The debt and equity issued to third parties by Williams Partners
    L.P. is reported as a component of our consolidated debt balance
    and minority interest balance, respectively.

On April 4, 2007, Northwest Pipeline retired
    $175 million of 8.125 percent senior unsecured notes
    due 2010. Northwest Pipeline paid premiums of approximately
    $7 million in conjunction with the early debt retirement.
    These premiums are considered recoverable through rates and are
    therefore deferred as a component of

other assets and
    deferred charges

on our consolidated balance sheet,
    amortizing over the life of the original debt.

On April 5, 2007, Northwest Pipeline issued
    $185 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.95 percent senior unsecured notes due 2017 to certain
    institutional investors in a private debt placement. In August
    2007, Northwest Pipeline completed an exchange of these notes
    for substantially identical new notes that are registered under
    the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Under the terms of the Northwest Pipeline $185 million
    5.95 percent senior unsecured notes mentioned above,
    Northwest Pipeline was obligated to file a registration
    statement for an offer to exchange the notes for a new issue of
    substantially identical notes registered under the Securities
    Act of 1933, as amended, within 180 days from closing and
    use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
    registration statement to be declared effective within
    270 days after closing. Northwest Pipeline initiated an
    exchange offer on July 26, 2007, which expired on
    August 23, 2007. Northwest Pipeline received full
    participation in the exchange offer.

During December 2007, we repurchased $22 million of our
    8.125 percent senior unsecured notes due March 2012 and
    $213 million of our 7.125 percent senior unsecured
    notes due September 2011. In conjunction with these early
    retirements, we paid premiums of approximately $19 million.
    These premiums, as well as related fees and expenses are
    recorded as

Stockholders’

In July 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
    of up to $1 billion of our common stock. We intend to
    purchase shares of our stock from time to time in open-market
    transactions or through privately negotiated or structured
    transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and
    other factors. This stock-repurchase program does not have an

    16 million shares for $526 million (including
    transaction costs) under the program at an average cost of
    $33.08 per share. This stock repurchase is recorded in

treasury stock

on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In November 2005, we initiated an offer to convert our
    5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures into
    our common stock. In January 2006, we converted approximately
    $220 million of the debentures in exchange for
    20 million shares of common stock, a $26 million cash
    premium, and $2 million of accrued interest.

We maintain a Stockholder Rights Plan, as amended and restated
    on September 21, 2004, and further amended May 18,
    2007, and October 12, 2007, under which each outstanding
    share of our common stock has a right (as defined in the plan)
    attached. Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised
    to purchase, at an exercise price of $50 (subject to
    adjustment), one two-hundredth of a share of Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The rights may be
    exercised only if an Acquiring Person acquires (or obtains the
    right to acquire) 15 percent or more of our common stock or
    commences an offer for 15 percent or more of our common
    stock. The plan contains a mechanism to divest of shares of
    common stock if such stock in excess of 14.9 percent was
    acquired inadvertently or without knowledge of the terms of the
    rights. The rights, which until exercised do not have voting
    rights, expire in 2014 and may be redeemed at a price of $.01
    per right prior to their expiration, or within a specified
    period of time after the occurrence of certain events. In the
    event a person becomes the owner of more than 15 percent of
    our common stock, each holder of a right (except an Acquiring
    Person) shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, our
    common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise
    price of the right. In the event we are engaged in a merger,
    business combination, or 50 percent or more of our assets,
    cash flow or earnings power is sold or transferred, each holder
    of a right (except an Acquiring Person) shall have the right to
    receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company
    having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the
    right.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Plan
    Information

Effective May 17, 2007, our stockholders approved a new
    plan that provides common-stock-based awards to both employees
    and nonmanagement directors. The new plan generally contains
    terms and provisions consistent with the previous plans. The new
    plan reserves 19 million shares for issuance. Awards
    outstanding in all prior plans remain in those plans with their
    respective terms and provisions. No new grants will be made from
    the prior plans. The new plan permits the granting of various
    types of awards including, but not limited to, restricted stock
    units and stock options. Restricted stock units are generally
    valued at market value on the grant date of the award and
    generally vest over three years. The purchase price per share
    for stock options generally may not be less than the market
    price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Stock
    options generally become exercisable over a three-year period
    from the date of the grant and can be subject to accelerated
    vesting if certain future stock prices or if specific financial
    performance targets are achieved. Stock options generally expire
    10 years after grant. At December 31, 2007,
    37 million shares of our common stock were reserved for
    issuance pursuant to existing and future stock awards, of which
    19 million shares were available for future grants.

Additionally, on May 17, 2007, our stockholders approved an
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) which authorizes up to
    2 million shares of our common stock to be available for
    sale under the plan. The ESPP enables eligible participants to
    purchase our common stock through payroll deductions not
    exceeding an annual amount of $15,000 per participant. The ESPP
    provides for offering periods during which shares may be
    purchased and continues until the earliest of: (1) the
    Board of Directors terminates the ESPP, (2) the sale of all
    shares available under the ESPP, or (3) the tenth
    anniversary of the date the Plan was approved by the
    stockholders. The first offering under the ESPP commenced on
    October 1, 2007 and ended on December 31, 2007.
    Subsequent offering periods will be from January through June
    and from July through December. Generally, all employees are
    eligible to participate in the ESPP, with the exception of
    executives and international employees. The number of shares
    eligible for an employee to purchase during each offering period
    is limited to 750 shares. The purchase price of the stock
    is 85 percent of the lower closing price of either the
    first or the last day of the offering period. The ESPP requires
    a one-year holding period before the stock can be sold.
    Approximately 2 million shares were available for purchase
    under the ESPP at December 31, 2007.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are valued at the date of award, which does not
    precede the approval date, and compensation cost is recognized
    on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
    requisite service period. Stock options generally become
    exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and
    generally expire ten years after the grant.

    historical volatility, returns during calendar year 2002 were
    excluded as the extreme volatility during that time is not
    reasonably expected to be repeated in the future. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant
    Maturity rates as of the grant date. The expected life of the
    option is based on historical exercise behavior and expected
    future experience.

Long-term debt

:  The fair value of our publicly
    traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded
    bond market prices. Private debt is valued based on the prices
    of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 90 percent
    and 87 percent, respectively, of our long-term debt was
    publicly traded.

Guarantees

:  The

guarantees

represented
    in the table below consist primarily of guarantees we have
    provided in the event of nonpayment by our previously owned
    communications subsidiary, Williams Communications Group
    (WilTel), on certain lease performance obligations. To estimate
    the fair value of the guarantees, the estimated default rate is
    determined by obtaining the average cumulative issuer-weighted
    corporate default rate for each guarantee based on the credit
    rating of WilTel’s current owner and the term of the
    underlying obligation. The default rates are published by
    Moody’s Investors Service.

Energy derivatives

:  Energy derivatives include:

•

Futures contracts;

•

Forward contracts;

•

Swap agreements;

The fair value of energy derivatives is determined based on the
    nature of the underlying transaction and the market in which the
    transaction is executed. We execute most of these transactions
    on an organized commodity exchange or in over-the-counter
    markets in which quoted prices exist for active periods. For
    contracts with terms that exceed the time period for which
    actively quoted prices are available, we determine fair value by
    estimating commodity prices during the illiquid periods
    utilizing internally developed valuations incorporating
    information obtained from commodity prices in actively quoted
    markets, quoted prices in less active markets, prices reflected
    in current transactions, and other market fundamental analysis.

Energy
    Derivatives

Our energy derivative contracts include the following:

Futures contracts

:  Futures contracts are
    standardized commitments through an organized commodity exchange
    to either purchase or sell a commodity at a future date for a
    specified price. Futures are generally settled in cash, but may
    be settled through delivery of the underlying commodity. The
    fair value of these contacts is generally determined using
    quoted prices.

Forward contracts

:  Forward contracts are
    over-the-counter commitments to either purchase or sell a
    commodity at a future date for a specified price, which involve
    physical delivery of energy commodities, and may contain either
    fixed or variable pricing terms. Forward contracts are valued
    based on prices of the underlying energy commodities over the
    contract life and contractual or notional volumes with the
    resulting expected future cash flows discounted to a present
    value using a risk-free market interest rate.

Swap agreements

:  Swap agreements require us to
    make payments to (or receive payments from) counterparties based
    upon the differential between a fixed and variable price or
    between variable prices of energy commodities at different
    locations. Swap agreements are valued based on prices of the
    underlying energy commodities over the contract life and
    contractual or notional volumes with the resulting expected
    future cash flows discounted to a present value using a
    risk-free market interest rate.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Option contracts

:  Physical and financial
    option contracts give the buyer the right to exercise the option
    and receive the difference between a predetermined strike price
    and a market price at the date of exercise. An option to
    purchase and an option to sell can be combined in an instrument
    called a collar to set a minimum and maximum transaction price.
    These contracts are valued based on option pricing models
    considering prices of the underlying energy commodities over the
    contract life, volatility of the commodity prices, contractual
    volumes, estimated volumes under option and other arrangements,
    and a risk-free market interest rate.

Energy
    commodity cash flow hedges

We are exposed to market risk from changes in energy commodity
    prices within our operations. We utilize derivatives to manage
    our exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows
    from forecasted purchases and sales of natural gas and
    forecasted sales of natural gas liquids (NGLs) attributable to
    commodity price risk. Certain of these derivatives have been
    designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133.

Our Exploration & Production segment produces, buys
    and sells natural gas at different locations throughout the
    United States. To reduce exposure to a decrease in revenues from
    fluctuations in natural gas market prices, we enter into natural
    gas futures contracts, swap agreements, and financial option
    contracts to mitigate the price risk on forecasted sales of
    natural gas. We have also entered into basis swap agreements to
    reduce the locational price risk associated with our producing
    basins. Exploration & Production’s cash flow
    hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash
    flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the
    hedge. However, ineffectiveness may be recognized primarily as a
    result of locational differences between the hedging derivative
    and the hedged item.

Our Midstream segment produces and sells NGLs at different
    locations throughout the United States. To reduce exposure to a
    decrease in revenues from fluctuations in NGL market prices, we
    hedge price risk by entering into NGL swap agreements, financial
    forward contracts, and financial option contracts to mitigate
    the price risk on forecasted sales of NGLs. Midstream’s
    cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective in
    offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the
    term of the hedge. However, ineffectiveness may be recognized
    primarily as a result of locational differences between the
    hedging derivative and the hedged item.

Changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges are deferred
    in other comprehensive income and are reclassified into

revenues

in the same period or periods in which the
    hedged forecasted purchases or sales affect earnings, or when it
    is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not
    occur by the end of the originally specified time period. During
    2006, we reclassified approximately $1 million of net gains
    from other comprehensive income to earnings as a result of the
    discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted
    transaction did not occur by the end of the originally specified
    time period. In second-quarter 2007, we recognized a net gain of
    $429 million (reported in

revenues

of discontinued
    operations) associated with the reclassification of deferred net
    hedge gains of our former power business from

accumulated
    other comprehensive income/loss

to earnings. This
    reclassification was based on the determination that the
    forecasted transactions related to the derivative cash flow
    hedges being sold to Bear Energy, LP were probable of not
    occurring. See Note 2 for further discussion. Approximately
    $14 million of net losses and $17 million of net gains
    from hedge ineffectiveness are included in

revenues

during 2007 and 2006, respectively. For 2007 and 2006, there
    are no derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment
    of hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2007, we have
    hedged portions of future cash flows associated with anticipated
    energy commodity purchases and sales for up to three years.
    Based on recorded values at December 31, 2007,
    approximately $35 million of net losses (net of income tax
    benefit of $22 million) will be reclassified into earnings
    within the next year. These recorded values are based on market
    prices of the commodities as of December 31, 2007. Due to
    the volatile nature of commodity prices and changes in the
    creditworthiness of counterparties, actual gains or losses
    realized in 2008 will likely differ from these values. These
    gains or losses will offset net losses or gains that will be
    realized in earnings from previous unfavorable or favorable
    market movements associated with underlying hedged transactions.

Other
    energy derivatives

Our Gas Marketing Services and Exploration &
    Production segments have other energy derivatives that have not
    been designated or do not qualify as SFAS No. 133
    hedges. As such, the net change in their fair value is
    recognized in

revenues

in the Consolidated Statement of
    Income. Even though they do not qualify for hedge accounting
    (see

derivative instruments and hedging activities

in
    Note 1 for a description of hedge accounting), certain of
    these derivatives hedge our future cash flows on an economic
    basis.

Other
    energy-related contracts

We also hold significant nonderivative energy-related contracts,
    such as storage and transportation agreements, in our Gas
    Marketing Services portfolio. These have not been included in
    the financial instruments table above or in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet because they are not derivatives as defined by
    SFAS No. 133.

Guarantees

In addition to the guarantees and payment obligations discussed
    elsewhere in these footnotes (see Notes 3 and 15), we have
    issued guarantees and other similar arrangements with
    off-balance sheet risk as discussed below.

In connection with agreements executed prior to our acquisition
    of Transco to resolve take-or-pay and other contract claims and
    to amend gas purchase contracts, Transco entered into certain
    settlements with producers which may require the indemnification
    of certain claims for additional royalties that the producers
    may be required to pay as a result of such settlements. Transco,
    through its agent, Gas Marketing Services, continues to purchase
    gas under contracts which extend, in some cases, through the
    life of the associated gas reserves. Certain of these contracts
    contain royalty indemnification provisions that have no carrying
    value. Producers have received certain demands and may receive
    other demands, which could result in claims pursuant to royalty
    indemnification provisions. Indemnification for royalties will
    depend on, among other things, the specific lease provisions
    between the producer and the lessor and the terms of the
    agreement between the producer and Transco. Consequently, the
    potential maximum future payments under such indemnification
    provisions cannot be determined. However, management believes
    that the probability of material payments is remote.

In connection with the 1993 public offering of units in the
    Williams Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust (Royalty Trust), our
    Exploration & Production segment entered into a gas
    purchase contract for the purchase of natural gas in which the
    Royalty Trust holds a net profits interest. Under this
    agreement, we guarantee a minimum purchase price that the
    Royalty Trust will realize in the calculation of its net profits
    interest. We have an annual option to discontinue this minimum
    purchase price guarantee and pay solely based on an index price.
    The maximum potential future exposure associated with this
    guarantee is not determinable because it is dependent upon
    natural gas prices and production volumes. No amounts have been
    accrued for this contingent obligation as the index price
    continues to substantially exceed the minimum purchase price.

We are required by certain foreign lenders to ensure that the
    interest rates received by them under various loan agreements
    are not reduced by taxes by providing for the reimbursement of
    any domestic taxes required to be paid by the foreign lender.
    The maximum potential amount of future payments under these
    indemnifications is based on the related borrowings. These
    indemnifications generally continue indefinitely unless limited
    by the underlying tax regulations and have no carrying value. We
    have never been called upon to perform under these
    indemnifications.

We have provided guarantees in the event of nonpayment by our
    previously owned communications subsidiary, WilTel, on certain
    lease performance obligations that extend through 2042. The
    maximum potential exposure is approximately $44 million at
    December 31, 2007, and $46 million at
    December 31, 2006. Our exposure declines systematically
    throughout the remaining term of WilTel’s obligations. The
    carrying value of these guarantees is approximately
    $39 million at December 31, 2007.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Former managing directors of Gulf Liquids are involved in
    litigation related to the construction of gas processing plants.
    Gulf Liquids has indemnity obligations to the former managing
    directors for legal fees and potential losses that may result
    from this litigation. Claims against these former managing
    directors have been settled and dismissed after payments on
    their behalf by directors and officers insurers. Some unresolved
    issues remain between us and these insurers, but no amounts have
    been accrued for any potential liability.

We have guaranteed the performance of a former subsidiary of our
    wholly owned subsidiary MAPCO Inc., under a coal supply
    contract. This guarantee was granted by MAPCO Inc. upon the sale
    of its former subsidiary to a third-party in 1996. The
    guaranteed contract provides for an annual supply of a minimum
    of 2.25 million tons of coal. Our potential exposure is
    dependent on the difference between current market prices of
    coal and the pricing terms of the contract, both of which are
    variable, and the remaining term of the contract. Given the
    variability of the terms, the maximum future potential payments
    cannot be determined. We believe that our likelihood of
    performance under this guarantee is remote. In the event we are
    required to perform, we are fully indemnified by the purchaser
    of MAPCO Inc.’s former subsidiary. This guarantee expires
    in December 2010 and has no carrying value.

    Gulf Coast, Venezuela and Canada. Prior to the sale of
    substantially all of our power business, which was completed in
    November 2007, customers for power included the California
    Independent System Operator (ISO), the California Department of
    Water Resources, and other power marketers and utilities located
    throughout the United States. As a general policy, collateral is
    not required for receivables, but customers’ financial
    condition and credit worthiness are evaluated regularly.

Derivative
    assets and liabilities

We have a risk of loss as a result of counterparties not
    performing pursuant to the terms of their contractual
    obligations. Counterparty performance can be influenced by
    changes in the economy and regulatory issues, among other
    factors. Risk of loss results from items including credit
    considerations and the regulatory environment for which a
    counterparty transacts. We attempt to minimize credit-risk
    exposure to derivative counterparties and brokers through formal
    credit policies, consideration of credit ratings from public
    ratings agencies, monitoring

Note 15.  Contingent
    Liabilities and Commitments

Rate
    and Regulatory Matters and Related Litigation

Our interstate pipeline subsidiaries have various regulatory
    proceedings pending. As a result, a portion of the revenues of
    these subsidiaries has been collected subject to refund. We have
    accrued a liability for these potential refunds as of
    December 31, 2007, which we believe is adequate for any
    refunds that may be required.

We are party to pending matters involving pipeline
    transportation rates charged to our former Alaska refinery in
    prior periods. While we have no loss exposure in these matters,
    favorable resolution could result in refunds. In February 2008,
    the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in our favor in one of these
    cases. This ruling may be subject to further appeal.

Issues
    Resulting from California Energy Crisis

Our former power business was engaged in power marketing in
    various geographic areas, including California. Prices charged
    for power by us and other traders and generators in California
    and other western states in 2000 and 2001 were challenged in
    various proceedings, including those before the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC). These challenges included refund
    proceedings, summer 2002

90-day

contracts, investigations of alleged market manipulation
    including withholding, gas indices and other gaming of the
    market, new long-term power sales to the State of California
    that were subsequently challenged and civil litigation relating
    to certain of these issues. We have entered into settlements
    with the State of California (State Settlement), major
    California utilities (Utilities Settlement), and others that
    substantially resolved each of these issues with these parties.

As a result of a 2006 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision,
    which the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review, certain
    contracts that we entered into during 2000 and 2001 may be
    subject to partial refunds. These contracts, under which we sold
    electricity, totaled approximately $89 million in revenue.
    We expect the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the
    second quarter 2008. While we are not a party to the cases
    involved in the appellate court decision under review, the buyer
    of electricity from us is a party to the cases and claims that
    we must refund to the buyer any loss it suffers due to the
    decision and the FERC’s reconsideration of the contract
    terms at issue in the decision.

Certain other issues also remain open at the FERC and for other
    nonsettling parties.

Refund
    proceedings

Although we entered into the State Settlement and Utilities
    Settlement, which resolved the refund issues among the settling
    parties, we continue to have potential refund exposure to
    nonsettling parties, such as various California end users that
    did not participate in the Utilities Settlement. As a part of
    the Utilities Settlement, we funded escrow accounts that we
    anticipate will satisfy any ultimate refund determinations in
    favor of the nonsettling parties including interest on refund
    amounts that we might owe to settling and nonsettling parties.
    As part of the State Settlement, we were to pay an additional
    $45 million to the California Attorney General over three
    years. Upon the sale of our power business in November 2007 (see
    Note 2), we paid the entire remaining balance on a
    discounted basis.

We are also owed interest from counterparties in the California
    market during the refund period for which we have recorded a
    receivable totaling approximately $24 million at
    December 31, 2007. Collection of the interest and the
    payment of interest on refund amounts from the escrow accounts
    is subject to the conclusion of this proceeding. Therefore, we
    continue to participate in the FERC refund case and related
    proceedings.

Challenges to virtually every aspect of the refund proceedings,
    including the refund period, were and continue to be made to the
    Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.
    In August 2006, the Ninth Circuit issued its order that largely
    upheld the FERC’s prior rulings, but it expanded the types
    of transactions that were made subject to refund. This order is
    subject to further appeal. Because of our settlements, we do not
    expect that the

August 2006 decision will have a material impact on us. However,
    the final refund calculation has not been made because of the
    appeals and certain unclear aspects of the refund calculation
    process.

Reporting
    of Natural Gas-Related Information to Trade
    Publications

Civil suits based on allegations of manipulating published gas
    price indices have been brought against us and others, in each
    case seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are currently
    a defendant in:

•

State court litigation in California brought on behalf of
    certain business and governmental entities that purchased gas
    for their use.

•

Class action litigation and other litigation originally filed in
    state court in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee and
    Wisconsin brought on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of
    gas in those states. The Tennessee purchasers have appealed the
    Tennessee state court’s February 2007 dismissal of their
    case. The Missouri case has been remanded to Missouri state
    court. The cases in the other jurisdictions have been removed
    and transferred to the federal court in Nevada. On
    February 19, 2008, the federal court granted summary
    judgment in the Colorado case in favor of us and most of the
    other defendants. We expect that the Colorado plaintiffs will
    appeal.

Mobile
    Bay Expansion

In December 2002, an administrative law judge at the FERC issued
    an initial decision in Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
    Corporation’s (Transco) 2001 general rate case which, among
    other things, rejected the recovery of the costs of
    Transco’s Mobile Bay expansion project from its shippers on
    a “rolled-in” basis and found that incremental pricing
    for the Mobile Bay expansion project is just and reasonable. In
    March 2004, the FERC issued an Order on Initial Decision in
    which it reversed certain parts of the administrative law
    judge’s decision and accepted Transco’s proposal for
    rolled-in rates. Gas Marketing Services holds long-term
    transportation capacity on the Mobile Bay expansion project. If
    the FERC had adopted the decision of the administrative law
    judge on the pricing of the Mobile Bay expansion project and
    also required that the decision be implemented effective
    September 1, 2001, Gas Marketing Services could have been
    subject to surcharges of approximately $139 million,
    including interest, through December 31, 2007, in addition
    to increased costs going forward. Certain parties filed appeals
    in federal court seeking to overturn the FERC’s ruling on
    the rolled-in rates. Gas Marketing Services has reached an
    agreement in principle to settle this matter for
    $10 million.

Environmental
    Matters

Continuing
    operations

Since 1989, our Transco subsidiary has had studies underway to
    test certain of its facilities for the presence of toxic and
    hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if any,
    remediation may be necessary. Transco has responded to data
    requests from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) and state agencies regarding such potential contamination
    of certain of its sites. Transco has identified polychlorinated
    biphenyl (PCB) contamination in compressor systems, soils and
    related properties at certain compressor station sites. Transco
    has also been involved in negotiations with the EPA and state
    agencies to develop screening, sampling and cleanup programs. In
    addition, Transco commenced negotiations with certain
    environmental authorities and other parties concerning
    investigative and remedial actions relative to potential mercury
    contamination at certain gas metering sites. The costs of any
    such remediation will depend upon the scope of the remediation.
    At December 31, 2007, we had accrued liabilities of
    $6 million related to PCB contamination, potential mercury
    contamination, and other toxic and hazardous substances. Transco
    has been identified as a potentially responsible party at
    various Superfund and state waste disposal sites. Based on
    present volumetric estimates and other factors, we have
    estimated our aggregate exposure for remediation of these sites
    to be less than $500,000, which is included in the environmental
    accrual discussed above.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, our Northwest Pipeline subsidiary
    evaluated many of its facilities for the presence of toxic and
    hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if any,
    remediation might be necessary. Consistent with other natural
    gas transmission companies, Northwest Pipeline identified PCB
    contamination in air compressor systems, soils and related
    properties at certain compressor station sites. Similarly,
    Northwest Pipeline identified hydrocarbon impacts at these
    facilities due to the former use of earthen pits and mercury
    contamination at certain gas metering sites. The PCBs were
    remediated pursuant to a Consent Decree with the EPA in the late
    1980s and Northwest Pipeline conducted a voluntary

clean-up

of
    the hydrocarbon and mercury impacts in the early 1990s. In 2005,
    the Washington Department of Ecology required Northwest Pipeline
    to reevaluate its previous mercury

clean-ups

in
    Washington. Consequently, Northwest Pipeline is conducting
    additional remediation activities at certain sites to comply
    with Washington’s current environmental standards. At
    December 31, 2007, we have accrued liabilities totaling
    approximately $7 million for these costs. We expect that
    these costs will be recoverable through Northwest
    Pipeline’s rates.

We also accrue environmental remediation costs for natural gas
    underground storage facilities, primarily related to soil and
    groundwater contamination. At December 31, 2007, we have
    accrued liabilities totaling approximately $4 million for
    these costs.

In July 2006, the Colorado Department of Public Health and
    Environment (CDPHE) issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to
    Williams Production RMT Company related to operating permits for
    our Roan Cliffs and Hayburn gas plants in Garfield County,
    Colorado. We have met with the CDPHE to discuss the allegations
    contained in the NOV and have provided additional requested
    information to the agency.

On April 11, 2007, the New Mexico Environment
    Department’s Air Quality Bureau (NMED) issued an NOV to
    Williams Four Corners, LLC that alleged various emission and
    reporting violations in connection with our Lybrook gas
    processing plant’s flare and leak detection and repair
    program. The NMED proposed a penalty of approximately
    $3 million. We are discussing the basis for and the scope
    of the proposed penalty with the NMED.

On April 16, 2007, the CDPHE issued an NOV to Williams
    Production RMT Company related to alleged air permit violations
    at the Rifle Station natural gas dehydration facility located in
    Garfield County, Colorado. The Rifle Station facility had been
    shut down prior to our receipt of the NOV and, except for some
    minor operations, remains closed. We responded to the
    CDPHE’s notice on May 15, 2007.

On April 27, 2007, the Wyoming Department of Environmental
    Quality (WDEQ) issued an NOV to Williams Production RMT Company
    that alleged violations of various Wyoming Pollution Discharge
    Elimination System permits for our coal bed methane gas
    production facilities in the state. We are discussing the matter
    with the WDEQ and expect the penalty to be approximately $48,000.

Williams Production RMT Company performed voluntary audits of
    its 2006 and 2007 compliance with state and federal air
    regulations. In June 2007, we disclosed to the CDPHE, pursuant
    to its audit immunity privilege, our facilities that were not in
    compliance. We also described corrective actions that had or
    would be taken to remedy the issues. In January 2008, the
    Colorado Attorney General’s office informed us of its
    opinion that our disclosures do not qualify for the audit
    privilege immunity. We are currently negotiating with the CDPHE
    and the Attorney General’s office about this matter.

By letter dated September 20, 2007, the EPA required our
    Transco subsidiary to provide information regarding natural gas
    compressor stations in the states of Mississippi and Alabama as
    part of the EPA’s investigation of our compliance with the
    Clean Air Act. We have responded with the requested information.

Former
    operations, including operations classified as
    discontinued

In connection with the sale of certain assets and businesses, we
    have retained responsibility, through indemnification of the
    purchasers, for environmental and other liabilities existing at
    the time the sale was consummated, as described below.

Agrico

In connection with the 1987 sale of the assets of Agrico
    Chemical Company, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for
    environmental cleanup costs resulting from certain conditions at
    specified locations to the extent such costs exceed a specified
    amount. At December 31, 2007, we have accrued liabilities
    of approximately $8 million for such excess costs.

Other

At December 31, 2007, we have accrued environmental
    liabilities totaling approximately $21 million related
    primarily to our:

•

Potential indemnification obligations to purchasers of our
    former retail petroleum and refining operations;

•

Former propane marketing operations, bio-energy facilities,
    petroleum products and natural gas pipelines;

•

Discontinued petroleum refining facilities;

•

Former exploration and production and mining operations.

In 2004, our Gulf Liquids subsidiary initiated a self-audit of
    all environmental conditions (air, water, and waste) at three
    facilities in Geismar, Sorrento, and Chalmette, Louisiana. The
    audit revealed numerous infractions of Louisiana environmental
    regulations and resulted in a Consolidated Compliance Order and
    Notice of Potential Penalty from the Louisiana Department of
    Environmental Quality (LDEQ). In October 2007, we paid the
    agreed $109,000 penalty to the LDEQ as a comprehensive
    multi-media settlement.

Certain of our subsidiaries have been identified as potentially
    responsible parties at various Superfund and state waste
    disposal sites. In addition, these subsidiaries have incurred,
    or are alleged to have incurred, various other hazardous
    materials removal or remediation obligations under environmental
    laws.

Summary
    of environmental matters

Actual costs incurred for these matters could be substantially
    greater than amounts accrued depending on the actual number of
    contaminated sites identified, the actual amount and extent of
    contamination discovered, the final cleanup standards mandated
    by the EPA and other governmental authorities and other factors,
    but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Other
    Legal Matters

Will
    Price (formerly Quinque)

In 2001, fourteen of our entities were named as defendants in a
    nationwide class action lawsuit in Kansas state court that had
    been pending against other defendants, generally pipeline and
    gathering companies, since 2000. The plaintiffs alleged that the
    defendants have engaged in mismeasurement techniques that
    distort the heating content of natural gas, resulting in an
    alleged underpayment of royalties to the class of producer
    plaintiffs and sought an unspecified amount of damages. The
    fourth amended petition, which was filed in 2003, deleted all of
    our defendant entities except two Midstream subsidiaries. All
    remaining defendants have opposed class certification and a
    hearing on plaintiffs’ second motion to certify the class
    was held in April 2005. We are awaiting a decision from the
    court. The amount of any possible liability cannot be reasonably
    estimated at this time.

Grynberg

In 1998, the DOJ informed us that Jack Grynberg, an individual,
    had filed claims on behalf of himself and the federal
    government, in the United States District Court for the District
    of Colorado under the False Claims Act against us and certain of
    our wholly owned subsidiaries. The claims sought an unspecified
    amount of royalties allegedly not paid to the federal
    government, treble damages, a civil penalty, attorneys’
    fees, and costs. In

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

connection with our sales of Kern River Gas Transmission in 2002
    and Texas Gas Transmission Corporation in 2003, we agreed to
    indemnify the purchasers for any liability relating to this
    claim, including legal fees. The maximum amount of future
    payments that we could potentially be required to pay under
    these indemnifications depends upon the ultimate resolution of
    the claim and cannot currently be determined. Grynberg had also
    filed claims against approximately 300 other energy companies
    alleging that the defendants violated the False Claims Act in
    connection with the measurement, royalty valuation and purchase
    of hydrocarbons. In 1999, the DOJ announced that it would not
    intervene in any of the Grynberg cases. Also in 1999, the Panel
    on Multi-District Litigation transferred all of these cases,
    including those filed against us, to the federal court in
    Wyoming for pre-trial purposes. Grynberg’s measurement
    claims remained pending against us and the other defendants; the
    court previously dismissed Grynberg’s royalty valuation
    claims. In May 2005, the court-appointed special master entered
    a report which recommended that the claims against our Gas
    Pipeline and Midstream subsidiaries be dismissed but upheld the
    claims against our Exploration & Production
    subsidiaries against our jurisdictional challenge. In October
    2006, the District Court dismissed all claims against us and our
    wholly owned subsidiaries, and in November 2006, Grynberg filed
    his notice of appeal with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.

In August 2002, Jack J. Grynberg, and Celeste C. Grynberg,
    Trustee on Behalf of the Rachel Susan Grynberg Trust, and the
    Stephen Mark Grynberg Trust, served us and one of our
    Exploration & Production subsidiaries with a complaint
    in the state court in Denver, Colorado. The complaint alleges
    that we have used mismeasurement techniques that distort the
    British Thermal Unit heating content of natural gas, resulting
    in the alleged underpayment of royalties to Grynberg and other
    independent natural gas producers. The complaint also alleges
    that we inappropriately took deductions from the gross value of
    their natural gas and made other royalty valuation errors. Under
    various theories of relief, the plaintiff is seeking actual
    damages of between $2 million and $20 million based on
    interest rate variations and punitive damages in the amount of
    approximately $1 million. In 2004, Grynberg filed an
    amended complaint against one of our Exploration &
    Production subsidiaries. This subsidiary filed an answer in
    January 2005, denying liability for the damages claimed. Trial
    in this case was originally set for May 2006, but the parties
    have negotiated an agreement dismissing the measurement claims
    and deferring further proceedings on the royalty claims until
    resolution of an appeal in another case. The amount of any
    possible liability cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Securities
    class actions

Numerous shareholder class action suits were filed against us in
    2002 in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Oklahoma. The majority of the suits alleged that we
    and co-defendants, WilTel, previously an owned subsidiary known
    as Williams Communications, and certain corporate officers,
    acted jointly and separately to inflate the stock price of both
    companies. WilTel was dismissed as a defendant as a result of
    its bankruptcy. These cases were consolidated and an order was
    issued requiring separate amended consolidated complaints by our
    equity holders and WilTel equity holders. The underwriter
    defendants have requested indemnification and defense from these
    cases. If we grant the requested indemnifications to the
    underwriters, any related settlement costs will not be covered
    by our insurance policies. We covered the cost of defending the
    underwriters. In 2002, the amended complaints of the WilTel
    securities holders and of our securities holders added numerous
    claims. On February 9, 2007, the court gave its final
    approval to our settlement with our securities holders. We
    entered into indemnity agreements with certain of our insurers
    to ensure their timely payment related to this settlement. The
    carrying value of our estimated liability related to these
    agreements is immaterial because we believe the likelihood of
    any future performance is remote.

On July 6, 2007, the court granted various defendants’
    motions for summary judgment and entered judgment for us and the
    other defendants in the WilTel matter. The plaintiffs appealed
    the court’s judgment. Any obligation of ours to the WilTel
    equity holders as a result of a settlement, or as a result of
    trial in the event of a successful appeal of the court’s
    judgment, will not likely be covered by insurance because our
    insurance coverage has been fully utilized by the settlement
    described above. The extent of any such obligation is presently
    unknown and cannot be estimated, but it is reasonably possible
    that our exposure could materially exceed amounts accrued for
    this matter.

TAPS
    Quality Bank

One of our subsidiaries, Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. (WAPI),
    is actively engaged in administrative litigation being conducted
    jointly by the FERC and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska
    (RCA) concerning the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) Quality
    Bank. In 2004, the FERC and RCA presiding administrative law
    judges rendered their joint and individual initial decisions,
    and we accrued approximately $134 million based on our
    computation and assessment of ultimate ruling terms that were
    considered probable. Our additional potential refund liability
    terminated on March 31, 2004, when we sold WAPI’s
    interests in the TAPS pipeline. We subsequently accrued
    additional amounts for interest.

In 2006, the FERC entered its final order (FERC Final Order),
    which the RCA adopted, and most of the parties appealed to the
    D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. ExxonMobil also filed a similar
    appeal in the Alaska Superior Court. A key issue pending on
    appeal is the limited retroactive impact of the FERC Final Order
    that restricts our exposure for Quality Bank adjustment refunds
    to periods after February 1, 2000. ExxonMobil asserts that
    the FERC’s reliance on the Highway Reauthorization Act as
    the basis for limiting the retroactive effect violates, among
    other things, the separation of powers under the
    U.S. Constitution by interfering with the FERC’s
    independent decision-making role. We expect a decision from the
    U.S. Supreme Court on the constitutional issues in 2008.

On June 7, 2007, the FERC stated the Quality Bank
    Administrator was free to issue invoices without any further
    action by the FERC. The Quality Bank Administrator issued
    invoices on July 31, 2007. We estimate that our net
    obligation for these invoices could be as much as
    $124 million. This amount remains an estimate because WAPI
    has not received all invoices to be issued to WAPI that arise
    out of the Administrator’s original invoices to third
    parties. Amounts accrued in excess of this estimated obligation
    will be retained pending resolution of all appeals.

Redondo
    Beach taxes

In February 2005, we and AES Redondo Beach, L.L.C. received a
    tax assessment letter from the city of Redondo Beach,
    California, in which the city asserted that approximately
    $33 million in back taxes and approximately
    $39 million in interest and penalties are owed related to
    natural gas used at the generating facility operated by AES
    Redondo Beach. Hearings were held in July 2005 and in September
    2005 the tax administrator for the city issued a decision in
    which he found us jointly and severally liable with AES Redondo
    Beach for back taxes of approximately $36 million and
    interest and penalties of approximately $21 million. Both
    we and AES Redondo Beach filed notices of appeal that were heard
    at the city level. In December 2006, the city hearing officer
    for the appeal of the pre-2005 amounts issued a final decision
    affirming our utility user tax liability and reversing AES
    Redondo Beach’s liability because the officer ruled that
    AES Redondo Beach is an exempt public utility. We appealed this
    decision to the Los Angeles Superior Court, and the city also
    appealed with respect to AES Redondo Beach. Those appeals were
    heard on January 25 and February 14, 2008. On
    April 30, 2007, we paid the city the protested amount of
    approximately $57 million in order to pursue its appeal.
    Despite the city hearing officer’s unfavorable decision and
    the payment to preserve our appeal rights, we do not believe a
    contingent loss is probable.

The city’s assessment of our liability for the periods from
    1998 through September 2007 is approximately $72 million
    (inclusive of interest and penalties). We protested all these
    assessments and requested hearings on them. We and AES Redondo
    Beach also filed separate refund actions in Los Angeles Superior
    Court related to certain taxes paid since the initial 2005
    notice of assessment. The refund actions are stayed pending the
    resolution of the appeals. In connection with the sale of our
    power business (see Note 2), we settled our dispute with
    AES Redondo Beach by equally sharing, for periods prior to the
    closing of the sale, any ultimate tax liability as well as the
    funding of amounts previously paid under protest.

Gulf
    Liquids litigation

Gulf Liquids contracted with Gulsby Engineering Inc. (Gulsby)
    and Gulsby-Bay for the construction of certain gas processing
    plants in Louisiana. National American Insurance Company (NAICO)
    and American Home



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Assurance Company provided payment and performance bonds for the
    projects. In 2001, the contractors, and sureties filed multiple
    cases in Louisiana and Texas against Gulf Liquids and us.

In 2006, at the conclusion of the consolidated trial of the
    asserted contract and tort claims, the jury returned its actual
    and punitive damages verdict against us and Gulf Liquids. Based
    on our interpretation of the jury verdicts, we estimated
    exposure for actual damages of approximately $68 million
    plus potential interest of approximately $25 million, all
    of which have been accrued as of December 31, 2007. In
    addition, we concluded that it was reasonably possible that any
    ultimate judgment might have included additional amounts of
    approximately $199 million in excess of our accrual, which
    primarily represented our estimate of potential punitive damage
    exposure under Texas law.

From May through October 2007, the court entered seven
    post-trial orders in the case (interlocutory orders) which,
    among other things, overruled the verdict award of tort and
    punitive damages as well as any damages against us. The court
    also denied the plaintiffs’ claims for attorneys’
    fees. On January 28, 2008, the court issued its judgment
    awarding damages against Gulf Liquids of approximately
    $11 million in favor of Gulsby and approximately
    $4 million in favor of Gulsby-Bay. If the judgment is
    upheld on appeal, our liability will be substantially less than
    the amount of our accrual for these matters.

Wyoming
    severance taxes

In August 2006, the Wyoming Department of Audit (DOA) assessed
    our subsidiary Williams Production RMT Company for additional
    severance tax and interest for the production years 2000 through
    2002. In addition, the DOA notified us of an increase in the
    taxable value of our interests for ad valorem tax purposes. We
    disputed the DOA’s interpretation of the statutory
    obligation and appealed this assessment to the Wyoming State
    Board of Equalization (SBOE). The SBOE upheld the assessment and
    remanded it to the DOA to address the disallowance of a credit.
    Apparently agreeing that we could not have known the DOA’s
    position before January 2007, the SBOE did not award interest on
    the assessment. We estimate that the amount of the additional
    severance and ad valorem taxes to be approximately
    $4 million. The Wyoming Supreme Court has agreed to hear
    our appeal of the SBOE’s determination. If the DOA prevails
    in its interpretation of our obligation and applies the same
    basis of assessment to subsequent periods, it is reasonably
    possible that we could owe a total of approximately
    $18 million to $20 million in additional taxes and
    interest from January 1, 2003, through December 31,
    2007.

Royalty
    litigation

In September 2006, royalty interest owners in Garfield County,
    Colorado, filed a class action suit in Colorado state court
    alleging that we improperly calculated oil and gas royalty
    payments, failed to account for the proceeds that we received
    from the sale of gas and extracted products, improperly charged
    certain expenses, and failed to refund amounts withheld in
    excess of ad valorem tax obligations. The plaintiffs claim that
    the class might be in excess of 500 individuals and seek an
    accounting and damages. The parties have agreed to stay this
    action in order to participate in ongoing mediation.

Certain other royalty matters are currently being litigated by a
    federal regulatory agency and another Colorado producer.
    Although we are not a party to the litigation, the final outcome
    of that case might lead to a future unfavorable impact on our
    results of operations.

Other
    Divestiture Indemnifications

Pursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to
    divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain
    purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect
    to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities
    provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions
    and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities
    that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. The
    indemnities



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

generally relate to breach of warranties, tax, historic
    litigation, personal injury, environmental matters, right of way
    and other representations that we have provided.

We sold a natural gas liquids pipeline system in 2002, and in
    July 2006, the purchaser of that system filed its complaint
    against us and our subsidiaries in state court in Houston,
    Texas. The purchaser alleges that we breached certain warranties
    under the purchase and sale agreement and seeks approximately
    $18 million in damages and our specific performance under
    certain guarantees. In 2006, we filed our answer to the
    purchaser’s complaint denying all liability. The trial is
    scheduled to begin on September 15, 2008, and our prior
    suit filed against the purchaser in Delaware state court is
    stayed pending resolution of the Texas case.

At December 31, 2007, we do not expect any of the
    indemnities provided pursuant to the sales agreements to have a
    material impact on our future financial position. However, if a
    claim for indemnity is brought against us in the future, it may
    have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the
    period in which the claim is made.

In addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are
    pending against us which are incidental to our operations.

Summary

Litigation, arbitration, regulatory matters, and environmental
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties. Were an
    unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a
    material adverse impact on the results of operations in the
    period in which the ruling occurs. Management, including
    internal counsel, currently believes that the ultimate
    resolution of the foregoing matters, taken as a whole and after
    consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage, recovery
    from customers or other indemnification arrangements, will not
    have a materially adverse effect upon our future financial
    position.

Commitments

Commitments for construction and acquisition of property, plant
    and equipment are approximately $484 million at
    December 31, 2007.

Segment
    Disclosures

Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
    different products and services. The segments are managed
    separately because each segment requires different technology,
    marketing strategies and industry knowledge. Our master limited
    partnership, Williams Partners L.P., is consolidated within our
    Midstream segment. (See Note 1.) Other primarily consists
    of corporate operations.

Performance
    Measurement

We currently evaluate performance based on

segment profit
    (loss)

from operations, which includes

segment revenues

from external and internal customers,

segment costs and
    expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization, equity
    earnings (losses)

and

loss from investments

including
    impairments related to investments accounted for under the
    equity method. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those described in Note 1. Intersegment sales are
    generally accounted for at current market prices as if the sales
    were to unaffiliated third parties.

Energy commodity hedging by our business units may be done
    through intercompany derivatives with our Gas Marketing Services
    segment which, in turn, enters into offsetting derivative
    contracts with unrelated third parties. Gas Marketing Services
    bears the counterparty performance risks associated with the
    unrelated third parties in these transactions. Additionally,
    beginning in the first quarter of 2007, hedges related to
    Exploration & Production may be entered into directly
    between Exploration & Production and third parties
    under its new credit agreement. (See Note 11.)
    Exploration & Production bears the counterparty
    performance risks associated with the unrelated third parties in
    these transactions.

Gas Marketing Services primarily supports our natural gas
    businesses by providing marketing and risk management services,
    which include marketing and hedging the gas produced by
    Exploration & Production, and procuring fuel and
    shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids sales for Midstream.
    In addition, Gas Marketing manages various natural gas-related
    contracts such as transportation, storage, and related hedges,
    and provides services to third parties, such as producers.

External revenues of our Exploration & Production
    segment includes third-party oil and gas sales, which are more
    than offset by transportation expenses and royalties due third
    parties on intersegment sales.

Subsequent
    Events

In January 2008, we sold a contractual right to a production
    payment on certain future international hydrocarbon production
    for approximately $148 million. We have received
    $118 million in cash and $29 million has been placed
    in escrow subject to certain post-closing conditions and
    adjustments. We will recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately
    $118 million in the first quarter of 2008 related to the
    initial cash received. As a result of the contract termination,
    we have no further interests associated with the crude oil
    concession, which is located in Peru. We had obtained these
    interests through our acquisition of Barrett Resources
    Corporation in 2001.

During third-quarter 2007, we formed Williams Pipeline Partners
    L.P. (WMZ) to own and operate natural gas transportation and
    storage assets. In January 2008, WMZ completed its initial
    public offering of 16.25 million common units at a price of
    $20.00 per unit. In February 2008, the underwriters also
    exercised their right to purchase an additional
    1.65 million common units at the same price. A subsidiary
    of ours serves as the general partner of WMZ. The initial asset
    of the partnership is a 35 percent interest in Northwest
    Pipeline GP, formerly Northwest Pipeline Corporation. Upon
    completion of the transaction, we hold approximately
    47.7 percent of the interests in WMZ including the
    interests of the general partner. In accordance with EITF Issue

No. 04-5

(see Note 1), WMZ will continue to be consolidated within
    our Gas Pipeline segment due to our control through the general
    partner, which is wholly owned by us.

At December 31, 2007, we held all of Williams Partners
    L.P.’s seven million subordinated units outstanding. In
    February 2008, all of these subordinated units were converted
    into common units due to factors which resulted in the
    termination of the subordination period. As a result, we will
    recognize a decrease to minority interest and a corresponding
    increase to stockholders’ equity of approximately
    $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2008.

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves

(Rule 4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X)

as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and
    natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
    demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future
    years from known reservoirs under existing economic and
    operating conditions. Our proved reserves consist of two
    categories, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped
    reserves. Proved developed reserves are currently producing
    wells and wells awaiting minor sales connection expenditure,
    recompletion, additional perforations or borehole stimulation
    treatments. Proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves which
    are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage
    or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
    required for recompletion. Proved reserves on undrilled acreage
    are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units
    that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where
    it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity
    of production from the existing productive formation.

•

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.73 pounds per square
    inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil reserves are
    insignificant and have been included in the proved reserves on a
    basis of billion cubic feet equivalents (Bcfe).

Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

The following is based on the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves and the year-end prices and costs. The average year-end
    natural gas prices used in the following estimates were $5.78,
    $4.81, and $6.95 per MMcfe at December 31, 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively. Future income tax expenses have been
    computed considering available carry forwards and credits and
    the appropriate statutory tax rates. The discount rate of
    10 percent is as prescribed by SFAS No. 69.
    Continuation of year-end economic conditions also is assumed.
    The calculation is based on estimates of proved reserves, which
    are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or
    possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are
    not considered. The calculation also requires assumptions as to
    the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the
    timing and amount of future development and production costs. Of
    the $3,497 million of future development costs,
    $1,135 million, $1,126 million and $468 million
    are estimated to be spent in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.

SUPPLEMENTAL

(Unaudited)

Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating volumes and
    the value of proved reserves and in projecting future production
    rates and timing of development expenditures. Such reserve
    estimates are subject to change as additional information
    becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the
    timing of production may be substantially different from the
    reserve estimates.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
    of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and 15d – 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act)
    (Disclosure Controls) was performed as of the end of the period
    covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the
    supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these Disclosure
    Controls are effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls
    will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
    matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
    reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
    control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
    must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
    the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
    costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
    systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within the company have been detected. These inherent
    limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
    be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the control. The design of any system of controls also is based
    in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
    succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
    conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a
    cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or
    fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure
    Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this
    regard is that the Disclosure Controls will be modified as
    systems change and conditions warrant.

    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
