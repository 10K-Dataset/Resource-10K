GENERAL

We are primarily an integrated natural gas company originally
    incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada in 1949 and
    reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1987.
    We were founded in 1908 when two Williams brothers began a
    construction company in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Today, we
    primarily find, produce, gather, process and transport natural
    gas. Our operations are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest,
    Rocky Mountains, Gulf Coast, Eastern Seaboard, and the province
    of Alberta in Canada.

Our principal executive offices are located at One Williams
    Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74172. Our telephone number is

918-573-2000.

CHANGE IN
    STRUCTURE AND DIVIDEND INCREASE

On February 16, 2011, we announced that our Board of
    Directors approved pursuing a plan to separate the company into
    two standalone, publicly traded corporations. The plan calls for
    the separation of our exploration and production business into a
    publicly traded company via an initial public offering of up to
    20 percent of our interest in the third quarter of 2011. We
    intend to complete the offering so that it preserves our ability
    to complete a tax-free spinoff of our remaining ownership in the
    exploration and production business to Williams’
    shareholders in 2012, after which Williams would continue as a
    premier natural gas infrastructure company. We retain the
    discretion to determine whether and when to execute the spinoff.

Additionally, we intend to increase the quarterly dividend paid
    to our shareholders, with an initial increase of 60 percent
    (to $0.20 per share), for the first quarter of 2011 payable in
    June 2011.

Management believes these actions will serve to enhance the
    growth potential and overall valuation of our assets.



FINANCIAL
    INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

See “

Item 8 — Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Note 18

” for information
    with respect to each segment’s revenues, profits or losses
    and total assets.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Substantially all our operations are conducted through our
    subsidiaries. To achieve organizational and operating
    efficiencies, our activities in 2010 were primarily operated
    through the following business segments:

•

Williams Partners

— comprised of our master
    limited partnership Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ), which includes
    gas pipeline and domestic midstream businesses. The gas pipeline
    business includes interstate natural gas pipelines and pipeline
    joint venture investments, and the midstream business provides
    natural gas gathering, treating and processing services; NGL
    production, fractionation, storage, marketing and
    transportation; deepwater production handling and crude oil
    transportation services and is comprised of several wholly owned
    and partially owned subsidiaries and joint venture investments.

•

Exploration & Production

— produces,
    develops, and manages natural gas and oil primarily located in
    the Rocky Mountain, Northeast and Mid-Continent regions of the
    United States and is comprised of several wholly owned and
    partially owned subsidiaries including Williams Production
    Company, LLC and Williams Production RMT Company, LLC. This
    segment also includes our 69 percent equity interest in
    Apco Oil and Gas International Inc., as well as gas marketing
    services which manage our natural gas commodity risk through
    purchases, sales and other related transactions, under our
    wholly owned subsidiary Williams Gas Marketing, Inc.

•

Other

— includes other business activities that
    are not operating segments, primarily our Canadian midstream and
    domestic olefins operations and a 25.5 percent interest in
    Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream), as well as
    corporate operations.

This report is organized to reflect this structure.

Due to expected future growth in our Canadian midstream and
    domestic olefins operations, we are considering reporting these
    businesses as a separate segment beginning in the first quarter
    of 2011.

Detailed discussion of each of our business segments follows.

Williams
    Partners

Gas
    Pipeline Business

Williams Partners owns and operates a combined total of
    approximately 13,900 miles of pipelines with a total annual
    throughput of approximately 2,800 TBtu of natural gas and

peak-day

delivery capacity of approximately 13 MMdt of natural gas.
    Our gas pipeline businesses consist primarily of
    Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) and
    Northwest Pipeline GP (Northwest Pipeline). Our gas pipeline
    business also holds interests in joint venture interstate and
    intrastate natural gas pipeline systems including a
    24.5 percent interest in Gulfstream. The gas pipeline
    businesses contributed revenues of approximately
    28 percent, 35 percent and 28 percent of Williams
    Partners’ revenues in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
    During third quarter 2010, Williams Partners L.P. completed a
    merger with Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. (WMZ). All of
    WMZ’s common and subordinated units have been extinguished
    and WMZ is wholly owned by Williams Partners. WMZ has been
    delisted and is no longer publicly traded.

Transco

Transco is an interstate natural gas transportation company that
    owns and operates a 10,000-mile natural gas pipeline system
    extending from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the offshore
    Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North
    Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the
    New York City metropolitan area. The system serves customers in
    Texas and 11 southeast and Atlantic seaboard states, including
    major metropolitan areas in Georgia, North Carolina,
    Washington, D.C., New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.



Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2010, Transco’s system had a mainline
    delivery capacity of approximately 4.9 MMdt of natural gas
    per day from its production areas to its primary markets. Using
    its Leidy Line along with market-area storage and transportation
    capacity, Transco can deliver an additional 3.9 MMdt of
    natural gas per day for a system-wide delivery capacity total of
    approximately 8.8 MMdt of natural gas per day.
    Transco’s system includes 45 compressor stations, four
    underground storage fields, and an LNG storage facility.
    Compression facilities at sea level-rated capacity total
    approximately 1.5 million horsepower.

Transco’s major natural gas transportation customers are
    public utilities and municipalities that provide service to
    residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation end
    users. Shippers on Transco’s system include public
    utilities, municipalities, intrastate pipelines, direct
    industrial users, electrical generators, gas marketers and
    producers. Transco’s firm transportation agreements are
    generally long-term agreements with various expiration dates and
    account for the major portion of Transco’s business.
    Additionally, Transco offers storage services and interruptible
    transportation services under short-term agreements.

Transco has natural gas storage capacity in four underground
    storage fields located on or near its pipeline system or market
    areas and operates two of these storage fields. Transco also has
    storage capacity in an LNG storage facility that it owns and
    operates. The total usable gas storage capacity available to
    Transco and its customers in such underground storage fields and
    LNG storage facility and through storage service contracts is
    approximately 200 billion cubic feet of gas. At
    December 31, 2010, our customers had stored in our
    facilities approximately 154 Bcf of natural gas. In addition,
    wholly owned subsidiaries of Transco operate and hold a
    35 percent ownership interest in Pine Needle LNG Company,
    LLC, a LNG storage facility with 4 billion cubic feet of
    storage capacity. Storage capacity permits Transco’s
    customers to inject gas into storage during the summer and
    off-peak periods for delivery during peak winter demand periods.

    approximately $341 million. Transco plans to place the
    project into service in November 2013, and it will increase
    capacity by 250 Mdt/d.

Northwest
    Pipeline

Northwest Pipeline is an interstate natural gas transportation
    company that owns and operates a natural gas pipeline system
    extending from the San Juan basin in northwestern New
    Mexico and southwestern Colorado through Colorado, Utah,
    Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington to a point on the Canadian
    border near Sumas, Washington. Northwest Pipeline provides
    services for markets in California, Arizona, New Mexico,
    Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington
    directly or indirectly through interconnections with other
    pipelines.

Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2010, Northwest Pipeline’s system,
    having long-term firm transportation agreements including
    peaking service of approximately 3.8 Bcf of natural gas per
    day, was composed of approximately 3,900 miles of mainline
    and lateral transmission pipelines and 41 transmission
    compressor stations having a combined sea level-rated capacity
    of approximately 477,000 horsepower.

Northwest Pipeline transports and stores natural gas for a broad
    mix of customers, including local natural gas distribution
    companies, municipal utilities, direct industrial users,
    electric power generators and natural gas marketers and
    producers. Northwest Pipeline’s firm transportation and
    storage contracts are generally long-term contracts with various
    expiration dates and account for the major portion of Northwest
    Pipeline’s business. Additionally, Northwest Pipeline
    offers interruptible and short-term firm transportation service.

Northwest Pipeline owns a one-third interest in the Jackson
    Prairie underground storage facility in Washington and contracts
    with a third party for storage service in the Clay basin
    underground field in Utah. Northwest Pipeline also owns and
    operates an LNG storage facility in Washington. These storage
    facilities have an aggregate working gas storage capacity of
    13.2 Bcf of natural gas, which is substantially utilized
    for third-party natural gas, and firm



delivery capability of approximately

700 MMcf/d

enable Northwest Pipeline to provide storage services to its
    customers and to balance daily receipts and deliveries.

Northwest
    Pipeline expansion project

Sundance
    Trail

In November 2009, we received approval from the FERC to
    construct approximately 16 miles of

30-inch

pipeline between our existing compressor stations in Wyoming as
    well as an upgrade to an existing Vernal, Utah compressor
    station. The total estimated cost of the project is
    approximately $50 million. We placed the project in service
    in November 2010 with an increase in capacity of 150 Mdt/d.

Gulfstream

Gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system extending from the
    Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in Florida. Williams
    Partners owns, through a subsidiary, a 24.5 percent
    interest in Gulfstream while we own a 25.5 percent interest
    through a subsidiary. Spectra Energy Corporation, through its
    subsidiary, and Spectra Energy Partners, LP, own the additional
    50 percent interest. Williams Partners shares operating
    responsibilities for Gulfstream with Spectra Energy Corporation.

Gulfstream
    expansion projects

The Gulfstream Phase V expansion involves the addition of
    compression to provide 35 Mdt/d of firm capacity by April 2011.
    The estimated capital cost of this expansion is approximately
    $44 million with Williams Partners’ share being
    24.5 percent of such cost.

Midstream
    Business

Williams Partners’ midstream business, one of the
    nation’s largest natural gas gatherers and processors, has
    primary service areas concentrated in major producing basins in
    Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, the Gulf of Mexico and
    Pennsylvania. The primary businesses — natural gas
    gathering, treating, and processing; NGL fractionation, storage
    and transportation; and oil transportation — fall
    within the middle of the process of taking raw natural gas and
    crude oil from the producing fields to the consumer.

Key variables for this business will continue to be:

•

Retaining and attracting customers by continuing to provide
    reliable services;

•

Revenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either
    completed or currently under construction;

•

Disciplined growth in core service areas and new step-out areas;

•

Prices impacting commodity-based processing activities.

The midstream business revenue contributed approximately
    72 percent, 66 percent and 72 percent of Williams
    Partners’ revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

One of our midstream customers, ONEOK Hydrocarbon LP, accounted
    for 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010. These
    revenues were generated by our NGL marketing business. There
    were no customers for which our sales exceeded 10 percent of our
    consolidated revenues in 2009 and 2008.

Gathering,
    processing and treating

Williams Partners’ gathering systems receive natural gas
    from producers’ oil and natural gas wells and gather these
    volumes to gas processing, treating or redelivery facilities.
    Typically, natural gas, in its raw form, is not acceptable for
    transportation in major interstate natural gas pipelines or for
    commercial use as a fuel. In addition, natural gas contains
    various amounts of NGLs, which generally have a higher value
    when separated from the natural



gas stream. Processing and treating plants remove water vapor,
    carbon dioxide and other contaminants and extract the NGLs. NGL
    products include:

•

Ethane, primarily used in the petrochemical industry as a
    feedstock for ethylene production, one of the basic building
    blocks for plastics;

•

Propane, used for heating, fuel and as a petrochemical feedstock
    in the production of ethylene and propylene, another building
    block for petrochemical-based products such as carpets, packing
    materials and molded plastic parts;

•

Normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline, primarily used
    by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor gasoline
    or as a petrochemical feedstock.

Although a significant portion of Williams Partners’ gas
    processing services are performed for a volumetric-based fee, a
    portion of our gas processing agreements are commodity-based and
    include two distinct types of commodity exposure. The first type
    includes “keep-whole” processing agreements whereby we
    own the rights to the value from NGLs recovered at our plants
    and we have the obligation to replace the lost heating value
    with natural gas. Under these agreements, we are exposed to the
    spread between NGL prices and natural gas prices. The second
    type consists of

“percent-of-liquids”

agreements whereby we receive a portion of the extracted liquids
    with no direct exposure to the price of natural gas. Under these
    agreements, we are only exposed to NGL price movements. NGLs we
    retain in connection with both of these types of processing
    agreements are referred to as our equity NGL production.
    Our gathering and processing agreements have terms ranging from

month-to-month

to the life of the producing lease. Generally, our gathering and
    processing agreements are long-term agreements.

Williams Partners’ gas gathering and processing customers
    are generally natural gas producers who have proved

and/or

producing natural gas fields in the areas surrounding its
    infrastructure. During 2010, these operations gathered and
    processed gas for approximately 215 gas gathering and processing
    customers. Williams Partners’ top 6 gathering and
    processing customers, one of which is an affiliate, accounted
    for approximately 50 percent of our gathering and
    processing revenue.

In addition to natural gas assets, Williams Partners owns and
    operates four deepwater crude oil pipelines and owns two
    production platforms serving the deepwater in the Gulf of
    Mexico. The crude oil transportation revenues are typically
    volumetric-based fee arrangements. However, a portion of its
    marketing revenues are recognized from purchase and sale
    arrangements whereby the oil that Williams Partners transports
    is purchased and sold as a function of the same index-based
    price. Williams Partners’ offshore floating production
    platforms provide centralized services to deepwater producers
    such as compression, separation, production handling, water
    removal and pipeline landings. Revenue sources have historically
    included a combination of fixed-fee, volumetric-based fee and
    cost reimbursement arrangements. Fixed fees associated with the
    resident production at our Devils Tower facility are recognized
    on a

units-of-production

basis.

Geographically, the midstream natural gas assets are positioned
    to maximize commercial and operational synergies with our other
    assets. For example, most of the offshore gathering and
    processing assets attach and process or condition natural gas
    supplies delivered to the Transco pipeline. Also, the gathering
    and processing facilities in the San Juan and Piceance
    basins handle approximately 92 percent of our
    Exploration & Production segment’s equity
    production in these basins. The San Juan basin, southwest
    Wyoming and Willow Creek systems deliver residue gas volumes
    into Northwest Pipeline’s interstate system in addition to
    third-party interstate systems.

Onshore
    region gathering, processing and treating

Williams Partners owns

and/or

operates gas gathering, processing and treating assets within
    the states of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and Pennsylvania.

In the Rocky Mountain area, the assets include:

Approximately 3,500 miles of gathering pipelines with a
    capacity of nearly 1 Bcf/d and over 4,000 receipt points
    serving the Wamsutter and southwest Wyoming areas in Wyoming;



•

Opal and Echo Springs processing plants with a combined daily
    inlet capacity of over 2.2 Bcf/d and NGL processing
    capacity of nearly 125 Mbbls/d, including the addition of a
    fourth cryogenic processing train at the Echo Springs plant
    which began processing in the fourth quarter of 2010.

In the Four Corners area, the assets include:

•

Approximately 3,800 miles of gathering pipelines with a
    capacity of nearly 2 Bcf/d and approximately 6,500 receipt
    points serving the San Juan basin in New Mexico and
    Colorado;

•

Ignacio, Kutz and Lybrook processing plants with a combined
    daily inlet capacity of

765 MMcf/d

and NGL processing capacity of approximately 40 Mbbls/d.
    The Ignacio plant also has the capacity to produce slightly more
    than 1 Mbbls/d of liquefied natural gas (LNG);

•

Milagro and Esperanza natural gas treating plants, which remove
    carbon dioxide but do not extract NGLs, with a combined daily
    inlet capacity of

750 MMcf/d.

At our Milagro facility, we also use gas-driven turbines to
    produce approximately 60 mega-watts per day of electricity which
    we primarily sell into the local electrical grid.

In the Piceance basin in Colorado, the assets include:

•

The Willow Creek processing plant, a

450 MMcf/d

cryogenic natural gas processing plant in western
    Colorado’s Piceance basin, designed to recover
    30 Mbbls/d of NGLs. The plant is currently operating at its
    designed inlet capacity. In the current processing arrangement
    with our Exploration & Production segment, Williams
    Partners receives a volumetric-based processing fee and a
    percent of the NGLs extracted.

•

Approximately 150 miles of gathering pipeline and the
    Parachute Plant Complex along with three other treating
    facilities with a combined processing capacity of
    1.2 Bcf/d, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010 from
    Exploration & Production.

•

Parachute Lateral, a

38-mile,

30-inch

diameter line transporting gas from the Parachute area to the
    Greasewood hub and White River hub in northwest Colorado. The
    Willow Creek plant processes gas flowing through the Parachute
    Lateral.

•

PGX pipeline delivering NGLs from our Exploration &
    Production segment’s existing Parachute area processing
    plants to a major NGL transportation pipeline system.

In the Appalachian basin in Pennsylvania, the assets include:

•

Approximately 75 miles of gathering pipelines and two
    compressor stations in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania in the
    Marcellus Shale, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010.
    Williams Partners has agreed to a new long-term dedicated
    gathering agreement with the seller for its production in the
    northeast Pennsylvania area of the Marcellus Shale. The acquired
    system will connect into the Transco pipeline with our

33-mile,

24-inch

diameter Springville gathering pipeline. Construction on the
    Springville pipeline is expected to begin in the first quarter
    of 2011 and be completed during 2011.

Gulf
    region gathering, processing and treating

Williams Partners’ owns

and/or

operates gas gathering and processing assets and crude oil
    pipelines primarily within the onshore and offshore shelf and
    deepwater areas in and around the Gulf Coast states of Texas,
    Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This includes:

•

Nearly 800 miles of onshore and offshore natural gas
    gathering pipelines with a combined capacity of approximately
    3.7 Bcf/d, including:

•

The

115-mile

deepwater Seahawk gas pipeline in the western Gulf of Mexico,
    flowing into the Markham processing plant and serving the
    Boomvang and Nansen field areas;



•

The

105-mile

deepwater Perdido Norte gas pipeline in the western Gulf of
    Mexico, which began transporting gas in the third quarter of
    2010 from a third-party producers’ floating production
    facility in to the Seahawk gathering system, which flows into
    Williams Partners’ Markham processing plant;

•

The

139-mile

Canyon Chief gas pipeline, including the Blind Faith extension
    in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, flowing into the Mobile Bay
    processing plant and serving the Devils Tower, Triton,
    Goldfinger, Bass Lite and Blind Faith fields;

•

Mobile Bay and Markham processing plants with a combined daily
    inlet capacity of 1.2 Bcf/d and NGL handling capacity of
    75 Mbbls/d, including the 2010 expansion of the Markham
    plant to accommodate production volumes from the Perdido Norte
    gas pipeline;

•

Canyon Station production platform, which brings natural gas to
    specifications allowable by major interstate pipelines but does
    not extract NGLs, with a daily inlet capacity of

500 MMcf/d;

•

Four deepwater crude oil pipelines with a combined length of
    nearly 400 miles and capacity of 475 Mbbls/d including:

•

BANJO pipeline running parallel to the Seahawk gas pipeline
    delivering production from two producer-owned spar-type floating
    production systems; and delivering production to the
    shallow-water platform at Galveston Area Block A244 (GA-A244)
    and then onshore through the Hoover Offshore Oil Pipeline System
    (HOOPS);

•

Perdido Norte pipeline running parallel to the Perdido Norte gas
    pipeline which began transporting oil in the third quarter of
    2010 from a third-party producers’ floating production
    facility and then onshore through HOOPS;

•

Alpine pipeline in the central Gulf of Mexico, serving the
    Gunnison field, and delivering production to GA-A244 and then
    onshore through HOOPS under a joint tariff agreement;

•

Mountaineer pipeline, including the Blind Faith extension, which
    connects to similar production sources as our Canyon Chief
    pipeline, ultimately delivering production to a terminal in
    Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana;

•

Devils Tower production platform located in Mississippi Canyon
    Block 773, approximately 150 miles south-southwest of
    Mobile, Alabama and serving production from the Devils Tower,
    Triton, Goldfinger and Bass Lite fields. Located in
    5,610 feet of water, it is one of the world’s deepest
    dry tree spars. The platform, which is operated by another
    party, is capable of handling

210 MMcf/d

of natural gas and 60 Mbbls/d of oil.

NGL
    marketing services

In addition to Williams Partners’ gathering and processing
    operations, we market NGL products to a wide range of users in
    the energy and petrochemical industries. The NGL marketing
    business transports and markets equity NGLs from the production
    at its processing plants, and also markets NGLs on behalf of
    third-party NGL producers, including some of its fee-based
    processing customers, and the NGL volumes owned by Discovery
    Producer Services LLC (Discovery). The NGL marketing business
    bears the risk of price changes in these NGL volumes while they
    are being transported to final sales delivery points. In order
    to meet sales contract obligations, Williams Partners may
    purchase products in the spot market for resale. The majority of
    sales are based on supply contracts of one year or less in
    duration.

Other
    Partially Owned Operations

Fractionation
    and Storage

Williams Partners owns interests in

and/or

operates NGL fractionation and storage assets. These assets
    include a 50 percent interest in an NGL fractionation
    facility near Conway, Kansas with capacity of slightly more than
    100 Mbbls/d and a 31.45 percent interest in another
    fractionation facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with a capacity



of 60 Mbbls/d. Williams Partners also fully owns
    approximately 20 million barrels of NGL storage capacity in
    central Kansas near Conway.

Overland
    Pass Pipeline

In September 2010, Williams Partners completed the
    $424 million acquisition of an additional 49 percent
    ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline (OPPL), which
    increased our ownership interest to 50 percent. As long as
    we retain a 50 percent ownership interest in OPPL, we have
    the right to become operator. We have notified our partner of
    our intent to operate and are currently working on an early 2011
    transition. OPPL includes a

760-mile

NGL
    pipeline from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid-Continent NGL market
    center in Conway, Kansas, along with

150-

and

125-mile

extensions into the Piceance and Denver-Joules basins in
    Colorado, respectively. Williams Partners’ equity NGL
    volumes from our two Wyoming plants and our Willow Creek
    facility in Colorado are dedicated for transport on OPPL under a
    long-term shipping agreement.

Discovery

Williams Partners owns a 60 percent equity interest in and
    operates the facilities of Discovery. Discovery’s assets
    include a

600 MMcf/d

cryogenic natural gas processing plant near Larose, Louisiana, a
    32 Mbbls/d NGL fractionator plant near Paradis, Louisiana
    and an offshore natural gas gathering and transportation system
    in the Gulf of Mexico.

Laurel
    Mountain

Williams Partners owns a 51 percent interest in a joint
    venture, Laurel Mountain Midstream LLC (Laurel Mountain), in the
    Marcellus Shale located in western Pennsylvania. Laurel
    Mountain’s assets, which we operate, include a gathering
    system of approximately 1,000 miles of pipeline with a
    fourth quarter 2010 average throughput of approximately

125 MMcf/d.

Laurel Mountain has a long-term, dedicated, volumetric-based fee
    agreement, with some exposure to natural gas prices, to gather
    the production of its joint venture partner’s production in
    the northeast Pennsylvania area of the Marcellus Shale.
    Construction began in 2010 on numerous new pipeline segments and
    compressor stations, the largest of which is the Shamrock
    compressor station. The Shamrock compressor station will have an
    initial capacity of

60 MMcf/d,

expandable to

350 MMcf/d,

which will likely be the largest central delivery point out of
    the Laurel Mountain system.

Aux
    Sable

Williams Partners also owns a 14.6 percent equity interest
    in Aux Sable Liquid Products and its Channahon, Illinois gas
    processing and NGL fractionation facility near Chicago. The
    facility is capable of processing up to 2.1 Bcf/d of
    natural gas from the Alliance Pipeline system and fractionating
    approximately 92 Mbbls/d of extracted liquids into NGL
    products.

Amounts have been recast to reflect the November 2010
    acquisition of certain gathering and processing assets in
    Colorado’s Piceance basin from Exploration &
    Production.

Exploration &
    Production

Our Exploration & Production segment includes natural
    gas and oil development, production and gas marketing activities
    primarily located in the Rocky Mountain (primarily Colorado,
    North Dakota, New Mexico, and Wyoming), Northeast
    (Pennsylvania), and Mid-Continent (Oklahoma and Texas) regions
    of the United States. We specialize in production from
    tight-sands and shale formations and coal bed methane (CBM)
    reserves in the Piceance, Appalachian, Williston, San Juan,
    Powder River, Fort Worth, Green River and Arkoma basins. Almost
    97 percent of our domestic proved reserves are natural gas.
    We also have international oil and gas interests, which include
    a 69 percent equity interest in Apco Oil and Gas
    International Inc., an oil and gas exploration and production
    company with operations in South America. If combined with our
    domestic proved reserves, our international interests would make
    up approximately 5 percent of our total proved reserves.
    Considering this, the reserves information included in this
    section relates only to our domestic activity. The gas marketing
    activities include transporting, scheduling, selling and hedging
    equity natural gas production as well as managing various
    natural gas related contracts such as transportation, storage
    and related hedges not utilized for our equity production.
    Additionally, Exploration & Production’s
    marketing group procures all fuel and shrink requirements and
    manages transportation and hedging activities in support of our
    midstream business.

Our strategy is to continue to drill our existing proved
    undeveloped reserves, which comprise approximately
    42 percent of proved reserves, and to drill in areas of
    probable and possible reserves in order to add to our proved
    reserves. Our current proved, probable, and possible reserves
    inventory provides us with strong capital investment
    opportunities for many years into the future.

Oil
    and Gas Reserves

The following table outlines our estimated net proved reserves
    expressed on a gas equivalent basis for the reporting periods
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Proved reserves for 2010
    and 2009 were prepared under rules issued by the SEC on January
    14, 2009. We prepare our own reserves estimates and the majority
    of our December 31, 2010 reserves were audited by
    Netherland, Sewell & Associates (NSAI) or Miller and
    Lents, Ltd (M&L). Proved reserves information is reported
    as gas equivalents, since oil volumes are insignificant in the
    three years shown below. Reserves for 2010 are approximately
    97 percent natural gas. Reserves are more than
    99 percent natural gas for 2009 and 2008. Oil reserves
    increased to approximately 3 percent of total proved
    reserves in 2010 as a result of a fourth quarter acquisition of
    undeveloped acreage and producing properties located in the
    Williston basin.

We have not filed on a recurring basis estimates of our total
    proved net oil and gas reserves with any U.S. regulatory
    authority or agency other than with the Department of Energy
    (DOE) and the SEC. The estimates furnished to the DOE have been
    consistent with those furnished to the SEC.

The 2010 year-end proved reserves were derived using the

12-month

average,

first-of-the-month

Henry Hub spot price of $4.38 per MMbtu, adjusted for locational
    price differentials. During 2010, we added 508 Bcfe of net
    additions to our proved reserves through drilling
    1,162 gross wells at a capital cost of approximately
    $988 million.

Reserves
    estimation process

Our reserves are estimated by deterministic methods by an
    appropriate combination of production performance analysis and
    volumetric techniques. The proved reserves for economic
    undrilled locations are estimated by analogy or volumetrically
    from offset developed locations. Reservoir continuity and
    lateral persistence of our tight-sands, shale and CBM reservoirs
    is established by combinations of subsurface analysis, 2D and 3D
    seismic, and pressure data. Understanding reservoir quality may
    be augmented by core samples analysis.

The engineering staff of each basin asset team provides the
    reserves modeling and forecasts for their respective areas.
    Various departments also participate in the preparation of the
    year-end reserves estimate by providing supporting information
    such as pricing, capital costs, expenses, ownership, gas
    gathering and gas quality. The departments and their roles in
    the year-end reserves process are coordinated by our reserves
    analysis department. The reserves analysis department’s
    responsibilities also include performing an internal review of
    reserves data for reasonableness and accuracy, working with the
    third-party consultants and the asset teams to successfully
    complete the third-party reserves audit, finalizing the year-end
    reserves report, and reporting reserves data to accounting.

The preparation of our year-end reserves report is a formal
    process. Early in the year, we begin with a review of the
    existing internal processes and controls to identify where
    improvements can be made from the prior year’s reporting
    cycle. Later in the year, the reserves staffs from the asset
    teams submit their preliminary reserves data to the reserves
    analysis department. After review by the reserves analysis
    department, the data is submitted to our third party engineering
    consultants, NSAI and M&L, to begin their audits. After
    this point, reserves data, analysis and further review are
    conducted and iterated between the asset teams, reserves
    analysis department and our third party engineering consultants.
    In early December, reserves are reviewed with senior management.
    The process concludes when all parties agree upon the reserve
    estimates and audit tolerance is achieved.

The reserves estimates resulting from our process are subjected
    to both internal and external controls to promote transparency
    and accuracy of the year-end reserves estimates. Our internal
    reserves analysis team is independent and does not work within
    an asset team or report directly to anyone on an asset team. The
    reserves analysis department provides detailed independent
    review and extensive documentation of the year-end process. Our
    internal processes and controls, as they relate to the year-end
    reserves, are reviewed and updated. The compensation of our
    reserves analysis team is not linked to reserves additions or
    revisions.



Approximately 93 percent of our total year-end 2010
    domestic proved reserves estimates were audited by NSAI. When
    compared on a

well-by-well

basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than
    the estimates of NSAI. However, in the opinion of NSAI, the
    estimates of our proved reserves are in the aggregate reasonable
    and have been prepared in accordance with principles set forth
    in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of
    Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of
    Petroleum Engineers. NSAI is satisfied with our methods and
    procedures in preparing the December 31, 2010 reserves
    estimates and future revenue, and noted nothing of an unusual
    nature that would cause NSAI to take exception with the
    estimates, in the aggregate, as prepared by us. The report of
    NSAI is included in Exhibit 99.1 to this

Form 10-K.

In addition, reserves estimates related to properties associated
    with the former Williams Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust were
    audited by M&L. These properties represent approximately
    1 percent of our total domestic proved reserves estimates.
    The report of M&L is included in Exhibit 99.2 to this

Form 10-K.

The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing
    preparation of the reserves estimates and the third- party
    reserves audit is the Director of Reserves and Production
    Services. The Director’s qualifications include
    28 years of reserves evaluation experience, a B.S. in
    geology from the University of Texas at Austin, an M.S. in
    Physical Sciences from the University of Houston, and membership
    in the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and The
    Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Proved
    undeveloped reserves (PUDs)

The majority of our reserves is concentrated in unconventional
    tight-sands, shale and coal bed gas reservoirs. We use available
    geoscience and engineering data to establish drainage areas and
    reservoir continuity beyond one direct offset from a producing
    well, which provides additional proved undeveloped reserves.
    Inherent in the methodology is a requirement for significant
    well density of economically producing wells to establish
    reasonable certainty. In fields where producing wells are less
    concentrated, only direct offsets from proved producing wells
    were assigned the proved undeveloped reserves classification. No
    new technologies were used to assign proved undeveloped reserves.

At December 31, 2010, our proved undeveloped reserves were
    1,774 Bcfe — a decrease of 94 Bcfe over our
    December 31, 2009 proved undeveloped reserves estimate of
    1,868 Bcfe. During 2010, 280 Bcfe of our
    December 31, 2009 proved undeveloped reserves were
    converted to proved developed reserves. An additional
    129 Bcfe was added due to the development of unproved
    locations. We have reclassified a net 253 Bcfe from proved
    to probable reserves attributable to locations not expected to
    be developed within five years. This amount is predominantly in
    the Piceance basin where the company has a large inventory of
    drilling locations. The downward revision has been offset by the
    addition of 342 Bcfe of new proved undeveloped drilling
    locations.

All proved undeveloped locations are scheduled to be spud within
    the next five years. Our five-year forecast indicates increasing
    capital to allow for the addition of rigs in years

2013-2015

in
    the Piceance basin. Our undeveloped estimate contains
    91 Bcfe of aging PUDs. The majority of these are scheduled
    to be spud by year-end 2011.

We use the terms “gross” to refer to all wells or
    acreage in which we have at least a partial working interest and
    “net” to refer to our ownership represented by that
    working interest. All of the wells drilled were natural gas
    wells.

In 2010, there were 5 gross nonproductive development wells
    and 3 net nonproductive development wells. Total gross
    operated wells drilled were 656 in 2010, 472 in 2009, and 1,125
    in 2008.

Present
    Activities

At December 31, 2010, we had 27 gross (16 net) wells
    in the process of being drilled.

Delivery
    Commitments

We hold a long-term obligation to deliver on a firm basis
    200,000 MMBtu/d of gas to a buyer at the White River Hub
    (Greasewood-Meeker, Colorado), which is the major market hub
    exiting the Piceance basin. The Piceance, being our largest
    producing basin, holds ample reserves to fulfill this obligation
    without risk of nonperformance during periods of normal
    infrastructure and market operations. While the daily volume of
    gas



is large and represents a significant percentage of our daily
    production, this transaction does not represent a material
    exposure.

Purchase
    Commitments

In connection with a gathering agreement entered into by
    Williams Partners with a third party in December 2010, we
    concurrently agreed to buy up to 200,000 MMBtu/d of natural
    gas priced at market prices from the same third party. Purchases
    under the

12-year

contract are expected to begin in the third quarter of 2011. We
    expect to sell this natural gas in the open market and may
    utilize available transportation capacity to facilitate the
    sales.

We use the term “gross” to refer to all wells or
    acreage in which we have at least a partial working interest and
    “net” to refer to our ownership represented by that
    working interest.

At December 31, 2010, there were 181 gross and
    105 net producing wells with multiple completions.

Piceance
    basin

The Piceance basin is located in northwestern Colorado and is
    our largest area of concentrated development. During 2010, we
    operated an average of 11 drilling rigs in the basin. This area
    has 1,567 undrilled proved locations in inventory. During 2010,
    an average of approximately 6.3 million gallons of NGLs
    were recovered each month at plants now owned and operated
    within Williams Partners, which were marketed separately from
    the residue natural gas.

Powder
    River basin

The Powder River basin is located in northeast Wyoming. The
    Powder River basin includes large areas with multiple coal seam
    potential, targeting thick coal bed methane formations at
    shallow depths.



San Juan
    basin

The San Juan basin is located in northwest New Mexico and
    southwest Colorado. We provide a significant amount of equity
    production that is gathered

and/or

processed by Williams Partners’ facilities in the
    San Juan basin.

Fort Worth
    basin

The Fort Worth basin is located in north central Texas
    where we drill horizontally into the Barnett Shale.

Appalachian
    basin

The Appalachian basin acreage is primarily located in
    northeastern Pennsylvania where we apply horizontal drilling in
    the Marcellus Shale. We have continued to expand our position
    since our entry into the basin in 2009.

Williston
    basin

The Williston basin acreage is located in North Dakota and
    Montana. Our focus in the basin is in North Dakota’s
    Bakken/Three Forks oil play where we have a 89,420 net
    acreage position, of which approximately 85,800 were acquired in
    December 2010 and are on the Fort Berthold Indian
    Reservation.

Other
    properties

Other properties are primarily comprised of interests in the
    Arkoma basin in southeastern Oklahoma. Also included are
    exploration activity and other miscellaneous activity.

Hedging
    Activity

To manage the commodity price risk and volatility of owning
    producing gas properties, we enter into derivative contracts for
    a portion of our expected future production. See further
    discussion in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Exploration & Production

, included in Item 7
    of this

Form 10-K

Acquisitions &
    Divestitures

During the second quarter of 2010, we entered into an agreement
    to acquire additional Appalachian leasehold acreage positions
    and a 5 percent overriding royalty interest associated with
    these acreage positions. These acquisitions nearly double our
    acreage holdings in the Marcellus Shale and closed in July for
    $599 million, including closing adjustments.

During 2010, we also spent a total of $164 million to
    acquire additional unproved leasehold acreage positions in the
    Marcellus Shale.

In October 2010, we exercised our right under the Williams Coal
    Seam Gas Royalty Trust Agreement to acquire the royalty
    interests for $22 million, including closing adjustments
    upon termination of the the Trust. Prior to the purchase, the
    Trust owned net profits interests in certain proved coal seam
    gas properties owned by Williams Production Company, LLC (WPC)
    and located in the San Juan basin.

In November 2010, we sold certain of our gathering and
    processing assets in Colorado’s Piceance basin to Williams
    Partners for $702 million in cash and approximately 1.8
    million common units. The assets include the Parachute Plant
    Complex, three other treating facilities with a combined
    processing capacity of 1.2 Bcf/d, and a gathering system
    with approximately 150 miles of pipeline. There are more
    than 3,300 wells connected to the gathering system, which
    includes pipelines ranging up to

30-inch

trunk lines. The transaction also includes a

life-of-lease

dedication from Exploration & Production.

In December 2010, we acquired a company that holds a major
    acreage position (approximately 85,800 net acres and
    includes 19 producing wells) in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale
    oil play (Williston basin) that will diversify our interests
    into light, sweet crude oil production. The purchase price was
    approximately $949 million, including closing adjustments.



Other

Domestic
    olefins

In the Gulf of Mexico region, we own a 5/6 interest in and are
    the operator of an NGL light-feed olefins cracker in Geismar,
    Louisiana, with a total production capacity of 1.35 billion
    pounds of ethylene and 90 million pounds of propylene per
    year. Our feedstocks for the cracker are ethane and propane; as
    a result, we are primarily exposed to the price spread between
    ethane and propane, and ethylene and propylene, respectively.
    Ethane and propane are available for purchase from third parties
    and from affiliates. We own ethane and propane pipeline systems
    in Louisiana that provide feedstock transportation to the
    Geismar plant and other third-party crackers. Additionally, we
    own a refinery grade propylene splitter and associated pipeline
    with a production capacity of approximately 500 million
    pounds per year of propylene. At our propylene splitter, we
    purchase refinery grade propylene and fractionate it into
    polymer grade propylene and propane; as a result we are exposed
    to the price spread between those commodities. As a merchant
    producer of ethylene and propylene, our product sales are to
    customers for use in making plastics and other downstream
    petrochemical products destined for both domestic and export
    markets. Our olefins business also operates an ethylene storage
    hub at Mont Belvieu using leased third-party underground storage
    wells.

We also market olefin and NGL products to a wide range of users
    in the energy and petrochemical industries. In order to meet
    sales contract obligations, we may purchase products for resale.

Canadian
    midstream

Our Canadian operations include an oil sands off-gas processing
    plant located near Ft. McMurray, Alberta, and an olefin
    fractionation facility and a butylene/butane splitter facility,
    both of which are located at Redwater, Alberta, which is near
    Edmonton, Alberta. We operate the Ft. McMurray area
    processing plant, while another party operates the Redwater
    facilities on our behalf. The butylene/butane splitter was
    completed and placed into service in August 2010. Our
    Ft. McMurray area facilities extract liquids from the
    off-gas produced by a third-party oil sands bitumen upgrading
    process. Our arrangement with the third-party upgrader is a
    “keep-whole” type where we remove a mix of NGLs and
    olefins from the off-gas and return the equivalent heating value
    back in the form of natural gas. We fractionate, treat, store,
    terminal and sell the propane, propylene, butane, butylene and
    condensate recovered from this process. Our commodity price
    exposure is the spread between the price for natural gas and the
    NGL and olefin products we produce. We continue to be the only
    NGL/olefins fractionator in western Canada and the only

treater/processor

of oil sands upgrader off-gas. Our extraction of liquids from
    upgrader off-gas streams allows the upgraders to burn cleaner
    natural gas streams and reduces their overall air emissions.

The Ft. McMurray extraction plant has processing capacity of

111 MMcf/d

with the ability to recover in excess of 17 Mbbls/d of
    olefin and NGL products. Our Redwater fractionator has a liquids
    handling capacity of

18 Mbbls/d.

The new butylene/butane splitter, which has a production
    capacity of 3.7 Mbbls/d of butylene and 3.7 Mbbls/d of
    normal butane, further fractionates the butylene/butane mix
    product produced at our Redwater fractionators into separate
    butylene and butane products, which receive higher values and
    are in greater demand. Our products are sold within Canada and
    the United States.

Canadian
    expansion project

Construction began in 2010 on a

261-mile,

12-inch

diameter Canadian pipeline which will transport recovered NGLs
    and olefins from our processing plant in Ft. McMurray to
    our Redwater fractionation facility. The pipeline will have
    sufficient capacity to transport additional NGLs and olefins
    from our existing operations as well as from other NGLs and
    olefins produced from oil sands off-gas. The project will be
    constructed using cash previously generated from Canadian and
    other international projects. We anticipate an in-service date
    in 2012.

Other

Considering the deteriorating circumstances in Venezuela, in
    2009 we fully impaired our $75 million investment in
    Accroven SRL, a Venezuelan operation, which included two

400 MMcf/d

NGL extraction plants, a 50 Mbbls/d NGL fractionation plant
    and associated storage and refrigeration facilities. (See
    Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) In
    June of 2010, we sold our 50 percent interest in Accroven
    to the state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.
    (PDVSA) for $107 million. Of this amount, $13 million
    was received in cash at closing and another $30 million was
    received in August 2010. The remainder is due in six quarterly



payments beginning October 31, 2010. The first quarterly
    payment of $11 million was received in January 2011 and
    will be recognized as income in 2011. We will continue to
    recognize the resulting gain as cash is received. Accroven was
    not part of our operations that were expropriated by the
    Venezuelan government in May 2009.

Additional
    Business Segment Information

Our ongoing business segments are accounted for as continuing
    operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes to
    financial statements included in Part II.

Operations related to certain assets in “Discontinued
    Operations” have been reclassified from their traditional
    business segment to “Discontinued Operations” in the
    accompanying financial statements and notes to financial
    statements included in Part II.

We perform certain management, legal, financial, tax,
    consultation, information technology, administrative and other
    services for our subsidiaries.

Our principal sources of cash are from dividends and advances
    from our subsidiaries, investments, payments by subsidiaries for
    services rendered, interest payments from subsidiaries on cash
    advances and, if needed, external financings, sales of master
    limited partnership units to the public, and net proceeds from
    asset sales. The amount of dividends available to us from
    subsidiaries largely depends upon each subsidiary’s
    earnings and operating capital requirements. The terms of
    certain of our subsidiaries’ borrowing arrangements may
    limit the transfer of funds to us under certain conditions.

We believe that we have adequate sources and availability of raw
    materials and commodities for existing and anticipated business
    needs. In support of our energy commodity activities, primarily
    conducted through gas marketing services which is included
    within our Exploration & Production segment, our
    counterparties require us to provide various forms of credit
    support such as margin, adequate assurance amounts and
    pre-payments for gas supplies. Our pipeline systems are all
    regulated in various ways resulting in the financial return on
    the investments made in the systems being limited to standards
    permitted by the regulatory agencies. Each of the pipeline
    systems has ongoing capital requirements for efficiency and
    mandatory improvements, with expansion opportunities also
    necessitating periodic capital outlays.

REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Williams
    Partners

Gas Pipeline Business.

Williams Partners gas
    pipeline’s interstate transmission and storage activities
    are subject to FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938
    (NGA) and under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as
    such, its rates and charges for the transportation of natural
    gas in interstate commerce, its accounting, and the extension,
    enlargement or abandonment of its jurisdictional facilities,
    among other things, are subject to regulation. Each gas pipeline
    company holds certificates of public convenience and necessity
    issued by the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all
    pipelines, facilities and properties for which certificates are
    required under the NGA. Each gas pipeline company is also
    subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as
    amended, and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, which
    regulates safety requirements in the design, construction,
    operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission
    facilities. FERC Standards of Conduct govern how our interstate
    pipelines communicate and do business with gas marketing
    employees. Among other things, the Standards of Conduct require
    that interstate pipelines not operate their systems to
    preferentially benefit gas marketing functions.



Each of our interstate natural gas pipeline companies
    establishes its rates primarily through the FERC’s
    ratemaking process. Key determinants in the ratemaking process
    are:

•

Costs of providing service, including depreciation expense;

•

Allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the
    capital structure and related income taxes;

•

Contract and volume throughput assumptions.

The allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate
    design and the allocation of costs between the reservation and
    commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these
    proceedings, certain revenues previously collected may be
    subject to refund.

Pipeline
    Integrity Regulations

For Williams Partners’ gas pipeline business, Transco and
    Northwest Pipeline have developed an Integrity Management Plan
    that we believe meets the United States Department of
    Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
    Administration (PHMSA) final rule that was issued pursuant to
    the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002.
    The rule requires gas pipeline operators to develop an integrity
    management program for transmission pipelines that could affect
    high consequence areas in the event of pipeline failure. The
    Integrity Management Program includes a baseline assessment plan
    along with periodic reassessments to be completed within
    required timeframes. In meeting the integrity regulations,
    Transco and Northwest Pipeline have identified high consequence
    areas and developed baseline assessment plans. Transco and
    Northwest Pipeline are on schedule to complete the required
    assessments within required timeframes. Currently, Transco and
    Northwest Pipeline estimate the cost to complete the required
    initial assessments over the period from 2011 and 2012 and
    associated remediation will be primarily capital in nature and
    range between $80 million and $110 million for Transco
    and between $50 million and $60 million for Northwest
    Pipeline. Ongoing periodic reassessments and initial assessments
    of any new high consequence areas will be completed within the
    timeframes required by the rule. Management considers the costs
    associated with compliance with the rule to be prudent costs
    incurred in the ordinary course of business, and, therefore,
    recoverable through Transco’s and Northwest Pipeline’s
    rates.

Midstream Business.

For Williams
    Partners’ midstream business, onshore gathering is subject
    to regulation by states in which we operate and offshore
    gathering is subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
    (OCSLA). Of the states where the midstream business gathers gas,
    currently only Texas actively regulates gathering activities.
    Texas regulates gathering primarily through complaint mechanisms
    under which the state commission may resolve disputes involving
    an individual gathering arrangement. Although offshore gathering
    facilities are not subject to the NGA, offshore transmission
    pipelines are subject to the NGA, and in recent years the FERC
    has taken a broad view of offshore transmission, finding many
    shallow-water pipelines to be jurisdictional transmission. Most
    offshore gathering facilities are subject to the OCSLA, which
    provides in part that outer continental shelf pipelines
    “must provide open and nondiscriminatory access to both
    owner and nonowner shippers.”

The midstream business also owns interests in and operates two
    offshore transmission pipelines that are regulated by the FERC
    because they are deemed to transport gas in interstate commerce.
    Black Marlin Pipeline Company provides transportation service
    for offshore Texas production in the High Island area and
    redelivers that gas to intrastate pipeline interconnects near
    Texas City. Discovery provides transportation service for
    offshore Louisiana production from the South Timbalier, Grand
    Isle, Ewing Bank and Green Canyon (deepwater) areas to an
    onshore processing facility and downstream interconnect points
    with major interstate pipelines. FERC regulation requires all
    terms and conditions of service, including the rates charged, to
    be filed with and approved by the FERC before any changes can go
    into effect.

The midstream business owns an interest in, and is expected to
    become the operator in 2011, of Overland Pass Pipeline, which is
    an interstate natural gas liquids pipeline regulated by the FERC
    pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act. Overland Pass provides
    transportation service pursuant to tariffs filed with the FERC.



Exploration &
    Production

Our Exploration & Production business is subject to
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations on
    taxation and payment of royalties, and the development,
    production and marketing of oil and gas, and environmental and
    safety matters. Many laws and regulations require drilling
    permits and govern the spacing of wells, rates of production,
    water discharge, prevention of waste and other matters. Such
    laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning,
    designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning our
    oil and gas wells and other facilities. In addition, these laws
    and regulations, and any others that are passed by the
    jurisdictions where we have production, could limit the total
    number of wells drilled or the allowable production from
    successful wells, which could limit our reserves.

Our gas marketing business is subject to a variety of laws and
    regulations at the local, state and federal levels, including
    the FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
    regulations. In addition, natural gas markets continue to be
    subject to numerous and wide-ranging federal and state
    regulatory proceedings and investigations.

Other

Our Canadian assets are regulated by the Energy Resources
    Conservation Board (ERCB) and Alberta Environment. The
    regulatory system for the Alberta oil and gas industry
    incorporates a large measure of self-regulation, providing that
    licensed operators are held responsible for ensuring that their
    operations are conducted in accordance with all provincial
    regulatory requirements. For situations in which noncompliance
    with the applicable regulations is at issue, the ERCB and
    Alberta Environment have implemented an enforcement process with
    escalating consequences.

See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further details on our regulatory matters.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Our operations are subject to federal environmental laws and
    regulations as well as the state and tribal laws and regulations
    adopted by the jurisdictions in which we operate. We could incur
    liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful
    discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as
    liability for cleanup costs. Materials could be released into
    the environment in several ways including, but not limited to:

•

From a well or drilling equipment at a drill site;

•

Leakage from gathering systems, pipelines, processing or
    treating facilities, transportation facilities and storage tanks;

•

Damage to oil and gas wells resulting from accidents during
    normal operations;

•

Blowouts, cratering and explosions.

Because the requirements imposed by environmental laws and
    regulations are frequently changed, we cannot assure you that
    laws and regulations enacted in the future, including changes to
    existing laws and regulations, will not adversely affect our
    business. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damage
    caused by former operators of our properties.

We believe compliance with environmental laws and regulations
    will not have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures,
    earnings or competitive position. However, environmental laws
    and regulations could affect our business in various ways from
    time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance
    expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek
    relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of
    certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance
    expenses.

For a discussion of specific environmental issues, see
    “Environmental” under Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
    “Environmental Matters” in Note 16 of our Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.



COMPETITION

Williams
    Partners

For our gas pipeline business, the natural gas industry has
    undergone significant change over the past two decades. A
    highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and
    increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services,
    including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity,
    have developed. As a result, pipeline capacity is being used
    more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are
    increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity.

Local distribution company (LDC) and electric industry
    restructuring by states have affected pipeline markets. Pipeline
    operators are increasingly challenged to accommodate the
    flexibility demanded by customers and allowed under tariffs, but
    the changes implemented at the state level have not required
    renegotiation of LDC contracts. The state plans have in some
    cases discouraged LDCs from signing long-term contracts for new
    capacity.

States are in the process of developing new energy plans that
    may require utilities to encourage energy saving measures and
    diversify their energy supplies to include renewable sources.
    This could lower the growth of gas demand.

These factors have increased the risk that customers will reduce
    their contractual commitments for pipeline capacity. Future
    utilization of pipeline capacity will also depend on competition
    from LNG imported into markets and new pipelines from the
    Rockies and other new producing areas.

In our midstream business, we face regional competition with
    varying competitive factors in each basin. Our gathering and
    processing business competes with other midstream companies,
    interstate and intrastate pipelines, producers and independent
    gatherers and processors. We primarily compete with five to ten
    companies across all basins in which we provide services.
    Numerous factors impact any given customer’s choice of a
    gathering or processing services provider, including rate,
    location, term, reliability, timeliness of services to be
    provided, pressure obligations and contract structure. We also
    compete in recruiting and retaining skilled employees. By virtue
    of the master limited partnership structure, WPZ provides us
    with an alternative source of capital, which helps us compete
    against other master limited partnerships for capital projects.

Exploration &
    Production

Our exploration and production business competes with other oil
    and gas concerns, including major and independent oil and gas
    companies in the development, production and marketing of
    natural gas. We compete in areas such as acquisition of oil and
    gas properties and obtaining necessary equipment, supplies and
    services. We also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled
    employees.

In our gas marketing services business, we compete directly with
    large independent energy marketers, marketing affiliates of
    regulated pipelines and utilities, and natural gas producers. We
    also compete with brokerage houses, energy hedge funds and other
    energy-based companies offering similar services.

Other

Ethylene and propylene markets, and therefore our olefins
    business, compete in a worldwide marketplace. Due to our NGL
    feedstock position at Geismar, we will benefit from the lower
    cost position in North America versus other crude-based
    feedstocks worldwide. The majority of North American olefins
    producers have significant downstream petrochemical
    manufacturing for plastics and other products. As such, they buy
    or sell ethylene and propylene as required. We operate as a
    merchant seller of olefins with no downstream manufacturing, and
    therefore can be either a supplier or a competitor at any given
    time to these other companies depending on their market
    balances. Generally, we are viewed primarily as a supplier to
    these companies and not as a direct competitor. We compete on
    the basis of service, price and availability of the products we
    produce.

Our Canadian midstream facilities continue to be the only
    NGL/olefins fractionator in western Canada and the only
    treater/processor of oil sands upgrader off-gas. Our extraction
    of liquids from the upgrader off-gas stream allows the upgraders
    to burn cleaner natural gas streams and reduce their overall air
    emissions. Our Canadian



midstream business competes for the sale of its products with
    traditional Canadian midstream companies on the basis of
    operational expertise, price, service offerings and availability
    of the products we produce.

EMPLOYEES

At February 1, 2011, we had approximately
    5,022 full-time employees. None of our employees are
    represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining
    agreements.

Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions,
    uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or
    results to be materially different from those stated or implied
    in this report. Many of the factors that



will determine these results are beyond our ability to control
    or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to
    differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking
    statements include, among others, the following:

•

Availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent
    in assessing, estimating, acquiring and developing future
    natural gas and oil reserves), market demand, volatility of
    prices, and the availability and cost of capital;

•

Inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and
    general economic conditions (including future disruptions and
    volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these
    events on our customers and suppliers);

•

The strength and financial resources of our competitors;

•

Development of alternative energy sources;

•

The impact of operational and development hazards;

•

Costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government
    regulations (including climate change legislation

and/or

potential additional regulation of drilling and completion of
    wells), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate
    proceedings;

Risks associated with future weather conditions;

•

Acts of terrorism;

•

Additional risks described in our filings with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission.

Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
    forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly
    rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any
    obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to
    announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the
    forward-looking statements to reflect future events or
    developments.

In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors
    listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to
    change from those statements of intention set forth in this
    report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our
    results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and
    without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our
    assumptions, or otherwise.



Because forward-looking statements involve risks and
    uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in
    addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to
    differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
    statements. These factors are described in the following section.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in
    addition to the other information in this report. Each of these
    factors could adversely affect our business, operating results,
    and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value
    of an investment in our securities.

Risks
    Related to Separation Plan

If our
    plan to separate our exploration and production business is
    delayed or not completed, our stock price may decline and our
    growth potential may not be enhanced.

On February 16, 2011, we announced that our Board of
    Directors approved pursuing a plan to divide our businesses into
    two separate, publicly traded corporations. The plan calls for a
    separation of our exploration and production business through an
    initial public offering of up to 20 percent of the
    corporation holding that business in 2011 and a tax-free spinoff
    of our remaining interest in that corporation to our
    shareholders in 2012. The completion and timing of each of the
    transactions is dependent on a number of factors including, but
    not limited to, the macroeconomic environment, credit markets,
    equity markets, energy prices, the receipt of a tax opinion from
    counsel

and/or

Internal Revenue Service rulings, final approvals from our Board
    of Directors and other customary matters. We may not complete
    the transactions at all or complete the transactions on the
    timeline or on the terms that we announced. If the transactions
    are not completed or delayed, our stock price may decline and
    our growth potential may not be enhanced.

Risks
    Inherent in our Business

The
    long-term financial condition of our gas pipeline and midstream
    businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural
    gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for
    those supplies in our traditional markets, and the prices of and
    market demand for natural gas.

The development of the additional natural gas reserves that are
    essential for our gas pipeline and midstream businesses to
    thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for
    exploration and development drilling and the installation of
    production, gathering, storage, transportation and other
    facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered
    to our pipeline systems. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory
    limitations, including environmental regulations, or the lack of
    available capital for these projects could adversely affect the
    development and production of additional reserves, as well as
    gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and
    export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability
    to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and
    processing facilities.

Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins
    with access to our pipeline systems will also naturally decline
    over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these
    wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which
    production from these reserves declines may be greater than
    anticipated. Additionally, the competition for natural gas
    supplies to serve other markets could reduce the amount of
    natural gas supply for our customers. Accordingly, to maintain
    or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas
    transported on or gathered through our pipeline systems and cash
    flows associated with the gathering and transportation of
    natural gas, our customers must compete with others to obtain
    adequate supplies of natural gas. In addition, if natural gas
    prices in the supply basins connected to our pipeline systems
    are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions,
    our ability to compete with other transporters may be negatively
    impacted on a short-term basis, as well as with respect to our
    long-term recontracting activities. If new supplies of natural
    gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes
    from existing supply areas, if natural gas supplies are diverted
    to serve other markets, if development in new supply basins
    where we do not have significant gathering or pipeline systems
    reduces demand for our services, or if environmental regulators
    restrict new natural gas drilling, the overall volume of natural
    gas transported, gathered and stored on our system would
    decline, which could have a material



adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. In addition, new LNG import facilities built near
    our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and
    transportation facilities.

Significant
    prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and
    demand and cause a termination of our transportation and storage
    contracts or a reduction in throughput on the gas pipeline
    systems.

Higher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a
    decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in
    long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on
    our gas pipeline systems. Also, lower natural gas prices over
    the long term could result in a decline in the production of
    natural gas resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on the
    gas pipeline systems. As a result, significant prolonged changes
    in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on
    our gas pipeline business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Prices
    for NGLs, natural gas and other commodities, including oil, are
    volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our
    financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to
    maintain existing businesses.

Our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the
    value of certain segments of our businesses depend primarily
    upon the prices of NGLs, natural gas, oil, or other commodities,
    and the differences between prices of these commodities. Price
    volatility can impact both the amount we receive for our
    products and services and the volume of products and services we
    sell. Prices affect the amount of cash flow available for
    capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise
    additional capital. Any of the foregoing can also have an
    adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
    condition and cash flows.

The markets for NGLs, natural gas and other commodities are
    likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices
    might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and
    demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other
    factors that are beyond our control, including:

•

Worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas,
    NGLs, oil, and related commodities;

•

Turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions;

•

The activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
    Countries;

•

Terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets;

•

Weather conditions;

•

The level of consumer demand;

•

The price and availability of other types of fuels;

•

The availability of pipeline capacity;

•

Supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation
    disruptions;

•

The price and level of foreign imports;

•

Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;

•

Volatility in the natural gas and oil markets;

•

The overall economic environment;

•

The credit of participants in the markets where products are
    bought and sold;

•

The adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate
    change.



We
    might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated
    with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy
    markets.

Our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may
    consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities,
    including contracts for natural gas, NGLs, oil and other
    commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or
    cash throughout the United States. If the values of these
    contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not
    anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our
    results of operations. In the past, certain marketing and
    trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due
    to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. In certain
    instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to
    deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under
    contract. If such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our
    contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of
    amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from,
    counterparties. In addition, in our businesses, we often extend
    credit to our counterparties. Despite performing credit analysis
    prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we
    might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. If the
    counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any
    collateral that secures our counterparty’s obligation is
    inadequate, we will suffer a loss. Downturns in the economy or
    disruptions in the global credit markets could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform than we expect.

Significant
    capital expenditures are required to replace our
    reserves.

Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require
    substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded
    our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows
    from operations and debt and equity issuances. Future cash flows
    are subject to a number of variables, including the level of
    production from existing wells, prices of natural gas and oil,
    and our success in developing and producing new reserves. If our
    cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital
    expenditure budget, we may not be able to access additional bank
    debt, issue debt or equity securities or access other methods of
    financing on an economic basis to meet our capital expenditure
    budget. As a result, our capital expenditure plans may have to
    be adjusted.

Failure
    to replace reserves may negatively affect our
    business.

The growth of our Exploration & Production business
    depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional
    natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable.
    Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are
    produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or
    development activities or acquire properties containing proved
    reserves, or both. We may not be able to find, develop or
    acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. If natural gas
    or oil prices increase, our costs for additional reserves would
    also increase; conversely if natural gas or oil prices decrease,
    it could make it more difficult to fund the replacement of our
    reserves.

Exploration
    and development drilling may not result in commercially
    productive reserves.

Our past success rate for drilling projects should not be
    considered a predictor of future commercial success. We do not
    always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our
    drilling operations. The new wells we drill or participate in
    may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion
    of our investment in wells we drill or participate in. The cost
    of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain,
    and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a
    project. Our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry wells
    or wells that are productive but do not produce enough reserves
    to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs.
    Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or
    canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:

•

Increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
    availability of, drilling rigs and equipment, skilled labor,
    capital or transportation;

•

Unexpected drilling conditions or problems;

•

Regulations and regulatory approvals;

•

Changes or anticipated changes in energy prices;

•

Compliance with environmental and other governmental
    requirements.



Estimating
    reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties.
    Negative revisions to reserve estimates, oil and gas prices or
    assumptions as to future natural gas prices may lead to
    decreased earnings, losses, or impairment of oil and gas
    assets.

Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating
    underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured
    in an exact manner. Reserves that are “proved
    reserves” are those estimated quantities of crude oil,
    natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and
    engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered
    as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects.

The process relies on interpretations of available geological,
    geophysical, engineering and production data. There are numerous
    uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved
    reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing
    of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the
    control of the producer. The reserve data included in this
    report represent estimates. In addition, the estimates of future
    net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of
    such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future
    production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be
    correct.

Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic
    conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Changes
    to oil and gas prices in the markets for such commodities may
    have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain
    fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable
    reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve
    estimates.

If negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing
    the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the
    affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in
    losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense. These revisions, as well as revisions in the
    assumptions of future cash flows of these reserves, may also be
    sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties
    which would result in a noncash charge to earnings.

Certain
    of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term,
    fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even
    if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues
    received from such contracts.

Our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term,
    fixed price contracts. It is possible that costs to perform
    services under such contracts will exceed the revenues they
    collect for their services. Although most of the services are
    priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in
    rate cases, under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and
    a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at
    a “negotiated rate” that may be above or below the
    FERC regulated cost-based rate for that service. These
    “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject
    to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by
    inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities
    being used to perform the services.

We may
    not be able to maintain or replace expiring natural gas
    transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates or on a
    long-term basis.

Our primary exposure to market risk for our gas pipelines occurs
    at the time the terms of their existing transportation and
    storage contracts expire and are subject to termination. Upon
    expiration of the terms we may not be able to extend contracts
    with existing customers to obtain replacement contracts at
    favorable rates or on a long-term basis.

The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a
    number of factors beyond our control, including:

•

The level of existing and new competition to deliver natural gas
    to our markets;

•

The growth in demand for natural gas in our markets;

•

Whether the market will continue to support long-term firm
    contracts;

•

Whether our business strategy continues to be successful;

•

The level of competition for natural gas supplies in the
    production basins serving us;



•

The effects of state regulation on customer contracting
    practices.

Any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our
    existing contracts may have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Our
    risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective
    and could increase the volatility of our results.

Although we have systems in place that use various methodologies
    to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses,
    these systems might not always be followed or might not always
    be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage
    risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse
    changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse
    correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets,
    changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this
    report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and
    balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks
    have been identified.

In an effort to manage our financial exposure related to
    commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered and may
    in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks
    associated with our assets and operations. In these hedging
    activities, we have used and may in the future use fixed-price,
    forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures,
    financial swaps and option contracts traded in the

over-the-counter

markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no single hedging
    arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given
    contract. For example, a forward contract that would be
    effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not
    hedge the contract’s counterparty credit or performance
    risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist.
    While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within
    guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able
    to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash
    flows and results of operations could be impacted by
    counterparty default.

Our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to
    reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity
    markets could result in increased volatility of our reported
    results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of
    derivatives that qualify as hedges under generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP) to the extent that such hedges are
    not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the
    hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of
    derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as
    hedges under GAAP, must be recorded in our income. This creates
    the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to
    us has occurred during the applicable period.

The impact of changes in market prices for NGLs and natural gas
    on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced
    based on the level of our hedging activities. These hedging
    arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market
    prices for NGLs or natural gas were to change substantially from
    the price established by the hedges. In addition, our hedging
    arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain
    circumstances, including instances in which:

•

Volumes are less than expected;

•

The hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating
    the risk being hedged;

•

The counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor
    their financial commitments.

The
    adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory
    requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse
    impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our
    business and increase the working capital requirements to
    conduct these activities.

In July 2010, federal legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall
    Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was enacted.
    The Act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements
    for derivative transactions, including oil and gas hedging
    transactions. Among other things, the Act provides for the
    creation of position limits for certain derivatives
    transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be
    cleared on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required.
    The final impact of the Act on our hedging activities is
    uncertain at this time due to the requirement that the SEC and
    the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) promulgate
    rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within
    360 days from the date of enactment. These new rules and



regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative
    contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts or
    reduce the availability of derivatives. Although we believe the
    derivative contracts that we enter into should not be impacted
    by position limits and should be exempt from the requirement to
    clear transactions through a central exchange or to post
    collateral, the impact upon our businesses will depend on the
    outcome of the implementing regulations adopted by the CFTC.

Depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC, we
    might in the future be required to provide cash collateral for
    our commodities hedging transactions under circumstances in
    which we do not currently post cash collateral. Posting of such
    additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our
    cash available for capital expenditures. A requirement to post
    cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute
    hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect
    cash flows. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of
    the Act and regulations, our results of operations may become
    more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.

We
    depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our
    revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of
    any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our
    business.

Our gas pipeline and midstream businesses rely on a limited
    number of customers for a significant portion of their revenues.
    Although some of these customers are subject to long-term
    contracts, extensions or replacements of these contracts may not
    be renegotiated on favorable terms, if at all. The loss of all,
    or even a portion of the revenues from natural gas, NGLs or
    contracted volumes, as applicable, supplied by these customers,
    as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to
    negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts or otherwise,
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations, and cash flows, unless we are
    able to acquire comparable volumes from other sources.

We are
    exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and our credit risk
    management may not be adequate to protect against such
    risk.

We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment

and/or

nonperformance by our customers in the ordinary course of our
    business. Generally, our customers are rated investment grade,
    are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make
    prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns.
    However, our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate
    to fully eliminate customer credit risk. We cannot predict to
    what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating
    conditions in the economy, including declines in our
    customers’ creditworthiness. If we fail to adequately
    assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers,
    unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any
    resulting increase in nonpayment

and/or

nonperformance by them could cause us to write-down or write-off
    doubtful accounts. Such write-downs or write-offs could
    negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which
    they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and
    financial condition.

Our
    industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive
    pressure could adversely affect our business and operating
    results.

We have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses,
    and additional competitors may enter our markets. Other
    companies with which we compete may be able to respond more
    quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or
    to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their facilities than we can. In addition,
    current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions
    or have greater financial resources than we do, which could
    affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions.
    Similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in
    natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas
    services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline
    capacity, have developed. As a result, pipeline capacity is
    being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services
    are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline
    capacity. We may not be able to compete successfully against
    current and future competitors and any failure to do so could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations, and cash flows.



Our
    operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen
    interruptions for which they may not be adequately
    insured.

There are operational risks associated with drilling for,
    production, gathering, transporting, storage, processing and
    treating of natural gas and the fractionation and storage of
    NGLs, including:

•

Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, extreme weather
    conditions, and other natural disasters;

•

Aging infrastructure and mechanical problems;

•

Damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages;

•

Uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), NGLs,
    brine or industrial chemicals;

•

Collapse of storage caverns;

•

Operator error;

•

Damage inadvertently caused by third-party activity, such as
    operation of construction equipment;

•

Pollution and environmental risks;

•

Fires, explosions, craterings and blowouts;

•

Risks related to truck and rail loading and unloading;

•

Risks related to operating in a marine environment;

•

Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or
    those of other energy companies.

Any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal
    injuries, significant damage to property, environmental
    pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses
    to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we
    maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and
    losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. The
    location of certain segments of our facilities in or near
    populated areas, including residential areas, commercial
    business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level
    of damages resulting from these risks. In spite of our
    precautions, an event such as those described above could cause
    considerable harm to people or property, and could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by
    insurance. Accidents or other operating risks could further
    result in loss of service available to our customers.

Our
    costs of maintaining or repairing our facilities may exceed our
    expectations and the FERC or competition in our markets may not
    allow us to recover such costs in the rates we charge for our
    services.

We could experience unexpected leaks or ruptures on our gas
    pipeline and midstream systems, or be required by regulatory
    authorities to undertake modifications to our systems that could
    result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations if the costs of maintaining
    or repairing our facilities exceed current expectations and the
    FERC or competition in our markets do not allow us to recover
    such costs in the rates we charge for our service.

We do
    not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously
    harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our
    insurers to satisfy our claims.

We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our
    business, including environmental accidents. We do not maintain
    insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of
    loss.

We currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of
    $610 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate
    with a $2 million per occurrence deductible. This insurance
    covers us, our subsidiaries, and certain of our affiliates for
    legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury
    or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third
    parties. This excess liability insurance includes coverage for
    sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with
    the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual
    pollution liability coverage for natural gas and NGL operations.



Although we maintain property insurance on property we own,
    lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the
    full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount
    of business interruption loss we may experience. In addition,
    certain perils may be excluded from coverage or

sub-limited.

We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type
    and amount we desire at reasonable rates. We may elect to self
    insure a portion of our risks. We do not insure our onshore
    underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain
    locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. Only
    certain offshore key-assets are covered for property damage and
    the resulting business interruption when loss is due to a named
    windstorm event and coverage for loss caused by a named
    windstorm is significantly

sub-limited.

All of our insurance is subject to deductibles. If a significant
    accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured it
    could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.

In addition, any insurance company that provides coverage to us
    may experience negative developments that could impair their
    ability to pay any of our claims. As a result, we could be
    exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have to
    obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost.

The occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability
    to repay our debt.

Execution
    of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks,
    increases in labor costs and materials, and other risks that may
    adversely affect financial results.

The growth in our gas pipeline and midstream businesses may be
    dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering,
    transportation, processing or treating pipelines and facilities
    or natural gas liquids fractionation or storage facilities, as
    well as the expansion of existing facilities. Construction or
    expansion of these facilities is subject to various regulatory,
    development and operational risks, including:

•

The ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by
    regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;

•

The availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to
    complete expansion projects;

•

Potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and
    regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent
    a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of
    the project;

•

Impediments on our ability to acquire

rights-of-way

or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;

•

The ability to construct projects within estimated costs,
    including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or
    increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, or other factors
    beyond our control, that may be material;

•

The ability to access capital markets to fund construction
    projects.

Any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding,
    delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. As a
    result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment
    return, which could adversely affect our results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Our
    costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension
    plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are
    affected by factors beyond our control.

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all
    of our U.S. employees and other post-retirement benefit
    plans covering certain eligible participants. The timing and
    amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit
    pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control,
    including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors
    outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates
    and changes in pension laws. Changes to these and other factors
    that can significantly increase our funding requirements could
    have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.



One of
    our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly
    traded limited partnership, Williams Partners L.P. As such, this
    subsidiary’s operations may involve a greater risk of
    liability than ordinary business operations.

One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of WPZ, a
    publicly-traded limited partnership. This subsidiary may be
    deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to
    WPZ as the general partner and to the limited partners of WPZ.
    Activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other
    persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of
    conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may
    involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a
    conflict of interests is found to exist. Our control of the
    general partner of WPZ may increase the possibility of
    claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought
    due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest
    that may arise between WPZ, on the one hand, and its general
    partner and that general partner’s affiliates, including
    us, on the other hand). Any liability resulting from such claims
    could be material.

Potential
    changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our
    financial results and disclosures in the future, which might
    change the way analysts measure our business or financial
    performance.

Regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at
    accounting practices, financial disclosures, and companies’
    relationships with their independent public accounting firms. It
    remains unclear what new laws or regulations will be adopted,
    and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of that any such new
    laws or regulations could have. In addition, the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or FERC could enact new
    accounting standards or FERC orders that might impact how we are
    required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and
    equity. Any significant change in accounting standards or
    disclosure requirements could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our
    investments and projects located outside of the United States
    expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and
    the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates,
    political conditions and policies of foreign governments. These
    risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our
    international projects.

We currently own and might acquire

and/or

dispose of material energy-related investments and projects
    outside the United States. The economic and political conditions
    in certain countries where we have interests or in which we
    might explore development, acquisition or investment
    opportunities present risks of delays in construction and
    interruption of business, as well as risks of war,
    expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions
    or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax
    policy, that are greater than in the United States. The
    uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign
    countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make
    investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse
    project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could
    adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their
    obligations with respect to such projects or investments and
    could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements
    relating to such projects or investments.

Operations and investments in foreign countries also can present
    currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and
    repatriation risk. In certain situations under which we develop
    or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary
    conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert
    to U.S. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign
    currencies. In addition, risk from fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or
    borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in
    another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can
    reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service
    obligations. We may or may not put contracts in place designed
    to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. We have some
    exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses
    or volatility in our results of operations.

Our
    operating results for certain segments of our business might
    fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.

Revenues from certain segments of our business can have seasonal
    characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for
    natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a
    result, our overall operating results in



the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.
    Demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly
    from our expectations depending on the nature and location of
    our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural
    gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by
    unusual weather patterns. Additionally, changes in the price of
    natural gas could benefit one of our businesses, but
    disadvantage another. For example, our Exploration &
    Production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices,
    and our midstream business, which uses gas as a feedstock, may
    not.

We do
    not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities
    are located, which could disrupt our operations.

We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and
    facilities have been constructed. As such, we are subject to the
    possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. In
    those instances in which we do not own the land on which our
    facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and
    operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by
    third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of
    time. In addition, some of our facilities cross Native American
    lands pursuant to

rights-of-way

of limited term. We may not have the right of eminent domain
    over land owned by Native American tribes. Our loss of these
    rights, through our inability to renew

right-of-way

contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, results of operations, and financial condition and
    cash flows.

Risks
    Related to Strategy and Financing

Our
    debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may limit our
    access to credit and adversely affect our ability to operate our
    business.

Certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that
    restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to grant
    liens to support indebtedness, merge or sell substantially all
    of our assets, make certain distributions during an event of
    default, and incur additional debt. In addition, our debt
    agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may
    contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we
    will need to comply. These covenants could adversely affect our
    ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or
    engage in, expand or pursue our business activities and prevent
    us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be
    considered beneficial to us. Our ability to comply with these
    covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,
    including prevailing economic, financial and industry
    conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate,
    our current assumptions about future economic conditions turn
    out to be incorrect or unexpected events occur, our ability to
    comply with these covenants may be significantly impaired.

Our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements
    could result in events of default. Upon the occurrence of such
    an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all
    amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be
    immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if
    any, to extend further credit. Certain payment defaults or an
    acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a
    cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement.
    Such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider
    impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a
    default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If an event
    of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default,
    and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate
    the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we
    may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding
    under such debt agreements. For more information regarding our
    debt agreements, please read “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Liquidity.”

Our ability to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt
    obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on
    our operating performance, which will be affected by general
    economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory,
    business and other factors, many of which are beyond our
    control. Our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or
    obtain future credit will also depend upon the current
    conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit
    generally. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations
    or obtain future credit on favorable terms, if at all, we could
    be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek
    additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to
    obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.



Future
    disruptions in the global credit markets may make equity and
    debt markets less accessible, create a shortage in the
    availability of credit and lead to credit market volatility,
    which could disrupt our financing plans and limit our ability to
    grow.

In 2008, public equity markets experienced significant declines
    and global credit markets experienced a shortage in overall
    liquidity and a resulting disruption in the availability of
    credit. Future disruptions in the global financial marketplace,
    including the bankruptcy or restructuring of financial
    institutions, could make equity and debt markets inaccessible
    and adversely affect the availability of credit already arranged
    and the availability and cost of credit in the future. We have
    availability under our existing bank credit facilities, but our
    ability to borrow under those facilities could be impaired if
    one or more of our lenders fails to honor its contractual
    obligation to lend to us.

Adverse
    economic conditions could negatively affect our results of
    operations.

A slowdown in the economy has the potential to negatively impact
    our businesses in many ways. Included among these potential
    negative impacts are reduced demand and lower prices for our
    products and services, increased difficulty in collecting
    amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction in our
    credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or the
    negative impacts described above), which could result in
    reducing our access to credit markets, raising the cost of such
    access or requiring us to provide additional collateral to our
    counterparties.

A
    downgrade of our credit ratings could impact our liquidity,
    access to capital and our costs of doing business, and
    independent third parties determine our credit ratings outside
    of our control.

A downgrade of our credit rating might increase our cost of
    borrowing and could require us to post collateral with third
    parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. Our
    ability to access capital markets could also be limited by a
    downgrade of our credit rating and other disruptions. Such
    disruptions could include:

•

Economic downturns;

•

Deteriorating capital market conditions;

•

Declining market prices for natural gas, NGLs and other
    commodities;

•

Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or
    those of other energy companies;

•

The overall health of the energy industry, including the
    bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies.

Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when
    assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of
    criteria including, but not limited to, business composition,
    market and operational risks, as well as various financial
    tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria
    for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make
    changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are
    not recommendations to buy, sell or hold investments in the
    rated entity. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at
    any time by the ratings agencies, and no assurance can be given
    that we will maintain our current credit ratings or that our
    senior unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade
    by all of the credit rating agencies.

Risks
    Related to Regulations that Affect our Industry

Our
    gas pipelines could be subject to penalties and fines if they
    fail to comply with FERC regulations.

Our gas pipeline’s transportation and storage operations
    are regulated by FERC. Should our gas pipelines fail to comply
    with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules,
    regulations and orders, they could be subject to substantial
    penalties and fines. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC
    has civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) to
    impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,000,000 per
    day for each violation. Any material penalties or fines imposed
    by FERC could have a material adverse impact on our gas pipeline
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

The
    natural gas sales, transportation and storage operations of our
    gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could
    have an adverse impact on their ability to establish
    transportation and storage



rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of
    operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable
    rate of return.

The natural gas sales, transmission and storage operations of
    the gas pipelines are subject to federal, state and local
    regulatory authorities. Specifically, their interstate pipeline
    transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by
    the FERC. The federal regulation extends to such matters as:

•

Transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate
    commerce;

•

Rates, operating terms, and conditions of service, including
    initiation and discontinuation of service;

•

The types of services the gas pipelines may offer their
    customers;

•

Certification and construction of new facilities;

•

Acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities;

•

Accounts and records;

•

Depreciation and amortization policies;

•

Relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in
    marketing functions of the natural gas business;

•

Market manipulation in connection with interstate sales,
    purchases or transportation of natural gas.

Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate providers of
    natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services in
    interstate commerce, and such providers may only charge rates
    that have been determined to be just and reasonable by FERC. In
    addition, FERC prohibits providers from unduly preferring or
    unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to
    pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service.

Regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in
    many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues,
    decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and
    otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business.

Unlike other interstate pipelines that own facilities in the
    offshore Gulf of Mexico, Transco charges its transportation
    customers a separate fee to access its offshore facilities. The
    separate charge is referred to as an “IT feeder”
    charge. The “IT feeder” rate is charged only when gas
    is actually transported on the facilities and typically it is
    paid by producers or marketers. Because the “IT
    feeder” rate is typically paid by producers and marketers,
    it generally results in netback prices to producers that are
    slightly lower than the netbacks realized by producers
    transporting on other interstate pipelines. This rate design
    disparity could result in producers bypassing Transco’s
    offshore facilities in favor of alternative transportation
    facilities.

The rates, terms and conditions for interstate gas pipeline
    services are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs. Any successful
    complaint or protest against the rates of the gas pipelines
    could have an adverse impact on their revenues associated with
    providing transportation services. In addition, there is a risk
    that rates set by FERC in future rate cases filed by the gas
    pipelines will be inadequate to recover increases in operating
    costs or to sustain an adequate return on capital investments.
    There is also the risk that higher rates would cause their
    customers to look for alternative ways to transport natural gas.

We are
    subject to risks associated with climate change.

There is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases
    (GHGs) may be linked to climate change. Climate change and the
    costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation
    of GHGs have the potential to affect our business in many ways,
    including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing
    our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our
    products and services (due to change in both costs and weather
    patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we
    operate, all of which can create financial risks. For further
    information regarding risks to our business arising from climate
    change related legislation, please read the discussion below
    under “Our operations are subject to governmental laws and
    regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which
    may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and could
    exceed current expectations.”



Our
    operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations
    relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose
    us to significant costs and liabilities and could exceed current
    expectations.

The risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is
    inherent in natural gas drilling and well completion, gathering,
    transportation, storage, processing and treating, and in the
    fractionation and storage of NGLs, and we may incur substantial
    environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of these
    types of operations. Our operations are subject to extensive
    federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
    governing environmental protection, the discharge of materials
    into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial
    facilities. These laws include:

•

Clean Air Act (CAA) and analogous state laws, which impose
    obligations related to air emissions;

•

Clean Water Act (CWA), and analogous state laws, which regulate
    discharge of wastewaters from our facilities to state and
    federal waters;

•

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
    Liability Act (CERCLA), and analogous state laws, which regulate
    the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released
    at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or
    locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal;

•

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and analogous
    state laws, which impose requirements for the handling and
    discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities.

Various governmental authorities, including the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and analogous
    state agencies and the U.S. Department of Homeland
    Security, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws
    and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes
    requiring difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with
    these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the
    assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the
    imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter
    conditions on or revocation of permits, and the issuance of
    injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations.

There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs
    and liabilities in our business, some of which may be material,
    due to our handling of the products we gather, transport,
    process, fractionate and store, air emissions related to our
    operations, historical industry operations, waste disposal
    practices, and the prior use of flow meters containing mercury.
    Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without
    regard to fault under certain environmental laws and
    regulations, including CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws,
    for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with
    spills or releases of natural gas and wastes on, under, or from
    our properties and facilities. Private parties, including the
    owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering
    systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for
    reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal
    actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for
    non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for
    personal injury or property damage arising from our operations.
    Some sites we operate are located near current or former
    third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing operations, and
    there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites
    to ours. In addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and
    enforcement policies could materially increase our compliance
    costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary.
    Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or
    may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is
    made against us.

Our business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to
    stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting
    from non-compliance with required operating or other regulatory
    permits. Also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from
    time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for
    our operations. If there is a delay in obtaining any required
    environmental regulatory approvals, or if we fail to obtain and
    comply with them, the operation or construction of our
    facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional
    costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to
    our business, financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows.

We are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with
    the environmental condition of our facilities and assets,
    whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the
    liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In
    connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could
    acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against,
    environmental liabilities that could expose us to material
    losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the
    steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities
    into compliance could be



prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down,
    divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might
    cause us to incur losses.

In addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to
    GHGs and climate change creates the potential for financial
    risk. The U.S. Congress and certain states have for some
    time been considering various forms of legislation related to
    GHG emissions. There have also been international efforts
    seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of GHGs. In
    addition, increased public awareness and concern may result in
    more state, regional

and/or

federal requirements to reduce or mitigate GHG emissions.

Numerous states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize
    and reduce GHGs. In addition, on December 7, 2009, the EPA
    issued a final determination that six GHGs are a threat to
    public safety and welfare. This determination could lead to the
    direct regulation of GHG emissions in our industry under the
    EPA’s interpretation of its authority and obligations under
    the CAA. The recent actions of the EPA and the passage of any
    federal or state climate change laws or regulations could result
    in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our
    facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our
    facilities, and (iii) administer and manage any
    GHG emissions program. If we are unable to recover or pass
    through a significant level of our costs related to complying
    with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition. To the extent financial
    markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial
    risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to
    capital.

Certain environmental and other groups have suggested that
    additional laws and regulations may be needed to more closely
    regulate the hydraulic fracturing process commonly used in
    natural gas production. Legislation to further regulate
    hydraulic fracturing has been proposed in Congress and the
    U.S. Department of Interior has announced plans to
    formalize obligations for disclosure of chemicals associated
    with hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. In addition, some
    state and local authorities have considered or formalized new
    rules related to hydraulic fracturing and enacted moratoria on
    such activities. We cannot predict whether any federal, state or
    local legislation or regulation will be enacted in this area and
    if so, what its provisions would be. If additional levels of
    reporting, regulation and permitting were required, our
    operations and those of our customers could be adversely
    affected.

We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible
    expenditures related to environmental conditions based on
    current laws and regulations and current interpretations of
    those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or
    regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our
    assumptions may change, and any new capital costs incurred to
    comply with such changes may not be recoverable under our
    regulatory rate structure or our customer contracts. In
    addition, new environmental laws and regulations might adversely
    affect our products and activities, including drilling,
    processing, fractionation, storage and transportation, as well
    as waste management and air emissions. For instance, federal and
    state agencies could impose additional safety requirements, any
    of which could affect our profitability.

If
    third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our
    pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural
    gas and NGLs or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be
    adversely affected.

We depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that
    provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and
    facilities for the benefit of our customers. Because we do not
    own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing
    operation is not within our control. If these pipelines or other
    facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable
    for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of
    testing, line repair, damage to the pipelines or facilities,
    reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit
    requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or
    other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity
    to transport, store or deliver natural gas or NGL products to
    end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed NGLs, thereby
    reducing our revenues. Any temporary or permanent interruption
    at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party
    pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in
    volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or
    processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Our
    businesses are subject to complex government regulations. The
    operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by
    changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or
    implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations
    applicable to our businesses or our customers.

Existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws
    and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our
    facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and
    regulations could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For
    example, several ruptures on third party pipelines have occurred
    recently. In response, various legislative and regulatory
    reforms associated with pipeline safety and integrity have been
    proposed, including reforms that would require increased
    periodic inspections, installation of additional valves and
    other equipment on our gas pipelines and subjecting additional
    pipelines (including gathering facilities) to more stringent
    regulation. Such reforms, if adopted, could significantly
    increase our costs.

Legal
    and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the
    energy industry have adversely affected our business and may
    continue to do so.

Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has
    resulted in increased regulation being either proposed or
    implemented. Such scrutiny has also resulted in various
    inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in which we are
    a named defendant. Both the shippers on our pipelines and
    regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under
    certain circumstances. Any successful challenge could materially
    affect our results of operations.

Certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are
    ongoing. Adverse effects may continue as a result of the
    uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings, or
    additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state
    regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we
    cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether
    these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings
    against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other
    regulatory action, including legislation, which might be
    materially adverse to the operation of our business and our
    revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other
    ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters against us
    including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals and
    similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us.
    The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in
    the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or
    at all by insurance.

The
    recently lifted drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and
    potentially more stringent regulations and permitting
    requirements on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico could adversely
    affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash
    flows.

The drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico (in force from May
    to October 2010) impacted our production handling,
    gathering and transportation operations through production
    delays which reduced volumes of natural gas and oil delivered to
    our platform, pipeline and gathering facilities in 2010. In
    addition, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
    Enforcement continues to develop more stringent drilling and
    permitting requirements for producers in the Gulf of Mexico
    which could cause delays in production or new drilling. A
    significant decline or delay in production volumes in the Gulf
    of Mexico could adversely affect our operating results,
    financial condition and cash flows through reduced production
    handling activities, gathering and transportation volumes,
    processing activities or other midstream services.

Risks
    Related to Employees, Outsourcing of Noncore Support Activities,
    and Technology

Institutional
    knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement
    eligibility might not be adequately preserved.

In certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge
    resides with employees who have many years of service. As these
    employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace
    them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. In
    addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other
    qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer
    could be inadequate. If knowledge transfer, recruiting and
    retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts
    of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become
    unavailable to us.



Failure
    of or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might
    negatively impact our ability to conduct our
    business.

Some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing
    relationships. Although we have taken steps to build a
    cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our
    outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance,
    a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services
    performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or
    part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional
    knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be
    able to conduct our business. The expiration of such agreements
    or the transition of services between providers could lead to
    similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions.

Certain of our accounting, information technology, application
    development, and help desk services are currently provided by an
    outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the United
    States. The economic and political conditions in certain
    countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide
    services to us present similar risks of business operations
    located outside of the United States previously discussed,
    including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation,
    nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification
    of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are
    greater than in the United States.

Risks
    Related to Weather, other Natural Phenomena and Business
    Disruption

Our
    assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and
    other natural phenomena.

Our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can
    be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes,
    tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions,
    including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us
    to realize the historic rates of return associated with these
    assets and operations. Insurance may be inadequate, and in some
    instances, we have been unable to obtain insurance on
    commercially reasonable terms, or insurance has not been
    available at all. A significant disruption in operations or a
    significant liability for which we were not fully insured could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.

Our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions.
    To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change
    or demand is impacted by regulations associated with climate
    change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease
    depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, leading
    either to increased investment or decreased revenues.

Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be
    targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business
    or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or
    partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport
    or distribute natural gas, NGLs or other commodities. Acts of
    terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in
    connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental
    repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in
    revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

General

We are primarily an integrated natural gas company engaged in
    finding, producing, gathering, processing, and transporting
    natural gas. Our operations are located principally in the
    United States and are organized into the following segments as
    of December 31, 2010: Williams Partners,
    Exploration & Production, and Other. (See Note 1
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I,
    Item 1 for further discussion of these segments.)

Unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and
    analysis of critical accounting estimates, results of
    operations, and financial condition and liquidity relates to our
    current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction
    with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
    included in Part II, Item 8 of this document.

Change in
    Structure and Dividend Increase

On February 16, 2011, we announced that our Board of
    Directors approved pursuing a plan to separate the company into
    two standalone, publicly traded corporations. The plan calls for
    the separation of our exploration and production business into a
    publicly traded company via an initial public offering of up to
    20 percent of our interest in the third quarter of 2011. We
    intend to complete the offering so that it preserves our ability
    to complete a tax-free spinoff of our remaining ownership in the
    exploration and production business to Williams’
    shareholders in 2012, after which Williams would continue as a
    premier natural gas infrastructure company. We retain the
    discretion to determine whether and when to execute the spinoff.

Additionally, we intend to increase the quarterly dividend paid
    to our shareholders, with an initial increase of 60 percent
    (to $0.20 per share), for the first quarter of 2011 payable in
    June 2011.

Management believes these actions will serve to enhance the
    growth potential and overall valuation of our assets.

Overview
    of 2010

The effects of the severe economic recession during late 2008
    and 2009 have eased during 2010. Crude oil and NGL prices have
    returned to attractive levels, but natural gas prices have
    remained low. Natural gas prices have remained low and forward
    natural gas prices have declined, primarily as a result of
    significant increases in near- and long-term supplies, which
    have outpaced near-term demand growth. The decline in forward
    natural gas prices contributed significantly to impairments
    recorded by our Exploration & Production segment in
    the third quarter of 2010. However, lower natural gas prices,
    along with strong NGL prices and ethane demand, contributed to
    improved results in our midstream businesses. Abundant and
    low-cost natural gas reserves in the United States are



driving strong demand for midstream and pipeline infrastructure.
    Objectives and highlights of our plan for 2010 include:

Objectives

Highlights

Continuing to invest in our gathering and processing and
    interstate natural gas pipeline systems.

We invested $1 billion in capital and investment expenditures in
    our midstream businesses and also invested $473 million in
    capital expenditures in our gas pipelines during 2010.

Continuing to invest in our natural gas production development.

We invested $2.8 billion in drilling activity and acquisitions
    in Exploration & Production, including $1.7 billion related
    to acquisitions in the Bakken and Marcellus Shale areas.

Retaining the flexibility to adjust our planned levels of
    capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in
    economic conditions, as well as seizing attractive opportunities.

During 2010, our Williams Partners and Exploration &
    Production segments seized growth opportunities to expand in the
    Marcellus Shale, while Exploration & Production further
    diversified into oil production with an acquisition in North
    Dakota’s Bakken Shale.  (See further discussion in Other
    Significant 2010 Events.)  These expenditures were funded
    through cash flow from operations, debt and equity offerings at
    WPZ, and cash on hand, while maintaining our desired level of
    liquidity of at least $1 billion from

cash and cash
    equivalents

and unused revolving credit facilities.

Our 2010 income (loss) from continuing operations attributable
    to The Williams Companies, Inc. changed unfavorably by
    $1.5 billion compared to 2009. This decrease is primarily
    reflective of a $1 billion full impairment charge related
    to goodwill at Exploration & Production and
    $678 million of pre-tax charges associated with impairments
    of certain producing properties and acquired unproved reserves
    at Exploration & Production during the third quarter
    of 2010. Additionally, we had $648 million of pre-tax costs
    associated with our 2010 restructuring, including
    $606 million of early debt retirement costs. Partially
    offsetting these costs is the impact of an improved energy
    commodity price environment in 2010 compared to 2009. See
    additional discussion in Results of Operations.

Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 increased
    $79 million compared to 2009, primarily due to the
    improvement in the energy commodity price environment during the
    year. See additional discussion in Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Liquidity.

Other
    Significant 2010 Events

On February 17, 2010, we completed a strategic
    restructuring that involved contributing certain of our wholly
    and partially owned subsidiaries to WPZ, our consolidated master
    limited partnership, and restructuring our debt (see
    Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

In May 2010, Exploration & Production announced a
    major acreage acquisition in the Marcellus Shale located in
    northeast Pennsylvania. In July 2010, the purchase was completed
    for $599 million, including closing adjustments. (See
    Results of Operations — Segments,
    Exploration & Production.)

On May 24, 2010, WPZ and WMZ entered into a merger
    agreement providing for the merger of WMZ and WPZ. On
    August 31, 2010, the WMZ unitholders approved the proposed
    merger between the two master limited partnerships and the
    merger was completed.

In July 2010, we notified our partner in the Overland Pass
    Pipeline Company LLC (OPPL) of our election to exercise our
    option to purchase an additional ownership interest, which
    provides us with a 50 percent ownership



interest in OPPL, for approximately $424 million. This
    transaction was completed on September 9, 2010, primarily
    with proceeds from WPZ’s credit facility. (See Results of
    Operations — Segments, Williams Partners.)
    Additionally, WPZ completed an equity offering resulting in net
    proceeds of $437 million, which were used to reduce the
    borrowing under WPZ’s credit facility.

In October 2010, we filed an application with the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC) to upgrade compressor facilities
    and expand our existing natural gas transmission system from
    Alabama to markets as far north as North Carolina. The cost of
    the project is estimated to be $219 million. The project is
    expected to be phased into service in September 2012 and June
    2013, with an increase in capacity of 225 Mdt/d.

In November 2010, WPZ acquired a business from
    Exploration & Production represented by certain
    gathering and processing assets in Colorado’s Piceance
    basin, for $702 million in cash, approximately
    1.8 million of WPZ common units and an increase in the
    capital account of its general partner to allow us to maintain
    our 2 percent general partner interest. (See Note 1 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In November 2010, WPZ completed a public offering of
    $600 million of its 4.125 percent senior notes due
    2020. WPZ used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a
    portion of the cash consideration paid for the previously
    described gathering and processing assets in the Piceance basin.
    (See further discussion in Results of Operations —
    Segments, Williams Partners.)

In December 2010, WPZ acquired a midstream business in
    Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale for $150 million. (See
    further discussion in Results of Operations —
    Segments, Williams Partners.)

In December 2010, Exploration & Production acquired a
    company that holds a major acreage position (approximately
    85,800 net acres) in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale oil
    play that will diversify our interests into light, sweet crude
    oil production. The purchase price was approximately
    $949 million, including closing adjustments.

In December 2010, WPZ completed a public offering of
    8 million of its common units, representing limited-partner
    interests. WPZ used the net proceeds from the common unit public
    offering for repayment of a $200 million borrowing under
    the partnership’s credit facility, as well as funding a
    portion of the consideration for the acquisition of midstream
    assets in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale. We made a cash
    contribution to WPZ in order to maintain our 2 percent
    general partner interest in the partnership. As a result of the
    offering, our limited partner interest in the partnership was
    reduced to 73 percent. See additional discussion in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Liquidity.

Outlook
    for 2011

We believe we are well positioned to execute on our 2011
    business plan and to capture attractive growth opportunities.
    Economic and commodity price indicators for 2011 and beyond
    reflect continued improvement in the economic environment.
    However, given the potential volatility of these measures, it is
    reasonably possible that the economy could worsen

and/or

commodity prices could decline, negatively impacting future
    operating results and increasing the risk of nonperformance of
    counterparties or impairments of long-lived assets.

As a result of our 2010 restructuring, as previously discussed,
    we are better positioned to drive additional organic growth and
    aggressively pursue value-adding growth opportunities. Our
    structure is designed to lower capital costs, enhance reliable
    access to capital markets, and create a greater ability to
    pursue development projects and acquisitions.

We continue to operate with a focus on increasing Economic Value

Decreased drilling success at Exploration & Production;

•

Decreased volumes from third parties served by our midstream
    businesses;

•

General economic, financial markets, or industry downturn;

•

Changes in the political and regulatory environments;

•

Physical damages to facilities, especially damage to offshore
    facilities by named windstorms for which our aggregate insurance
    policy limit is $75 million in the event of a material loss.

We continue to address these risks through utilization of
    commodity hedging strategies, disciplined investment strategies,
    and maintaining at least $1 billion in consolidated
    liquidity from cash and cash equivalents and unused revolving
    credit facilities. In addition, we utilize master netting
    agreements and collateral requirements with our counterparties
    to reduce credit risk and liquidity requirements.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions. We have reviewed the selection,
    application, and disclosure of these critical accounting
    estimates with our Audit Committee. We believe that the nature
    of these estimates and assumptions is material due to the
    subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility of
    such matters to change, and the impact of these on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Impairments
    of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets

We have assessed goodwill for impairment annually as of the end
    of the year and we have performed interim assessments of
    goodwill if impairment triggering events or circumstances were
    present. One such triggering event is a significant decline in
    forward natural gas prices. During the first and second quarter
    of 2010, we evaluated the impact of declines in forward gas
    prices across all future production periods and determined that
    the impact was not significant enough to warrant a full
    impairment review. Forward natural gas prices through 2025 used
    in these prior analyses had declined less than 10 percent,
    on average, from December 31, 2009 through March 31,
    2010 and June 30, 2010. During the third quarter of 2010,
    these forward natural gas prices through 2025 declined an
    additional 19 percent for a total

year-to-date

decline of more than 22 percent on average through
    September 30, 2010. Based on forward prices as of
    September 30, 2010, we evaluated the impact of this decline
    across all future production periods and determined that a full
    impairment review was warranted.

As a result, we evaluated our goodwill of approximately
    $1 billion resulting from a 2001 acquisition at
    Exploration & Production related to its domestic
    natural gas production operations (the reporting unit). Our
    impairment evaluation of goodwill first considered our
    management’s estimate of the fair value of the reporting
    unit compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the
    carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, a
    computation of the implied fair value of the goodwill was
    compared with its related carrying value. If the carrying value
    of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value
    of that goodwill, an impairment loss was recognized in the
    amount of the excess. Because quoted market prices were not
    available for the reporting unit, management applied reasonable
    judgments (including market supported assumptions when
    available) in estimating the fair value for the reporting unit.
    We estimated the fair value of the reporting unit on a
    stand-alone basis and also



considered our market capitalization and third party estimates
    in corroborating our estimate of the fair value of the reporting
    unit.

The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated primarily by
    valuing proved and unproved reserves. We use an income approach
    (discounted cash flows) for valuing reserves. The significant
    inputs into the valuation of proved and unproved reserves
    include reserve quantities, forward natural gas prices,
    anticipated drilling and operating costs, anticipated production
    curves, income taxes, and appropriate discount rates. To
    estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and the implied
    fair value of goodwill under a hypothetical acquisition of the
    reporting unit, we assumed a tax structure where a buyer would
    obtain a

step-up

in
    the tax basis of the net assets acquired.

In our assessment as of September 30, 2010, the carrying
    value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded its
    fair value. We then determined that the implied fair value of
    the goodwill was zero. As a result, we recognized a full
    $1 billion impairment charge related to Exploration &
    Production’s goodwill. See Note 4 and Note 14 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    discussion and significant inputs into the fair value
    determination.

We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when we believe
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be
    able to recover the carrying value. Our computations utilize
    judgments and assumptions that include the estimated fair value
    of the asset, undiscounted future cash flows, discounted future
    cash flows, and the current and future economic environment in
    which the asset is operated.

As a result of significant declines in forward natural gas
    prices during the third quarter of 2010, we assessed
    Exploration & Production’s natural gas producing
    properties and acquired unproved reserve costs for impairment
    using estimates of future cash flows. Significant judgments and
    assumptions in these assessments include estimates of natural
    gas reserves quantities, estimates of future natural gas prices
    using a forward NYMEX curve adjusted for locational basis
    differentials, drilling plans, expected capital costs, and our
    estimate of an applicable discount rate commensurate with risk
    of the underlying cash flow estimates. The assessment performed
    at September 30, 2010 identified certain properties with a
    carrying value in excess of their calculated fair values. As a
    result, we recognized a $678 million impairment charge. See
    Note 4 and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional discussion and significant inputs into
    the fair value determination.

In addition to those long-lived assets described above for which
    impairment charges were recorded, certain others were reviewed
    for which no impairment was required. These reviews included
    Exploration & Production’s other domestic
    producing properties and acquired unproved reserve costs, and
    utilized inputs generally consistent with those described above.
    Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future
    cash flows used to evaluate these assets. The use of alternate
    judgments and assumptions could result in the recognition of
    different levels of impairment charges in the consolidated
    financial statements. For Exploration &
    Production’s other producing assets reviewed, but for which
    impairment charges were not recorded, we estimate that
    approximately 10 percent could be at risk for impairment if
    forward prices across all future periods decline by
    approximately 8 to 11 percent, on average, as compared to
    the forward prices at December 31, 2010. A substantial
    portion of the remaining carrying value of these other assets
    (primarily related to Exploration & Production’s
    assets in the Piceance basin) could be at risk for impairment if
    forward prices across all future periods decline by at least
    30 percent, on average, as compared to the prices at
    December 31, 2010.

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We review our energy contracts to determine whether they are
    derivatives or contain derivatives. We further assess the
    appropriate accounting method for any derivatives identified,
    which could include:

•

Qualifying for and electing cash flow hedge accounting, which
    recognizes changes in the fair value of the derivative in other
    comprehensive income (to the extent the hedge is effective)
    until the hedged item is recognized in earnings;

•

Qualifying for and electing accrual accounting under the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception; or

•

Applying

mark-to-market

accounting, which recognizes changes in the fair value of the
    derivative in earnings.



If cash flow hedge accounting or accrual accounting is not
    applied, a derivative is subject to

mark-to-market

accounting. Determination of the accounting method involves
    significant judgments and assumptions, which are further
    described below.

The determination of whether a derivative contract qualifies as
    a cash flow hedge includes an analysis of historical market
    price information to assess whether the derivative is expected
    to be highly effective in offsetting the cash flows attributed
    to the hedged risk. We also assess whether the hedged forecasted
    transaction is probable of occurring. This assessment requires
    us to exercise judgment and consider a wide variety of factors
    in addition to our intent, including internal and external
    forecasts, historical experience, changing market and business
    conditions, our financial and operational ability to carry out
    the forecasted transaction, the length of time until the
    forecasted transaction is projected to occur, and the quantity
    of the forecasted transaction. In addition, we compare actual
    cash flows to those that were expected from the underlying risk.
    If a hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring,
    or if the derivative contract is not expected to be highly
    effective, the derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting.

For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, we must
    periodically assess whether they continue to qualify for hedge
    accounting. We prospectively discontinue hedge accounting and
    recognize future changes in fair value directly in earnings if
    we no longer expect the hedge to be highly effective, or if we
    believe that the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer
    probable of occurring. If the forecasted transaction becomes
    probable of not occurring, we reclassify amounts previously
    recorded in other comprehensive income into earnings in addition
    to prospectively discontinuing hedge accounting. If the
    effectiveness of the derivative improves and is again expected
    to be highly effective in offsetting the cash flows attributed
    to the hedged risk, or if the forecasted transaction again
    becomes probable, we may prospectively re-designate the
    derivative as a hedge of the underlying risk.

Derivatives for which the normal purchases and normal sales
    exception has been elected are accounted for on an accrual
    basis. In determining whether a derivative is eligible for this
    exception, we assess whether the contract provides for the
    purchase or sale of a commodity that will be physically
    delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold over a
    reasonable period in the normal course of business. In making
    this assessment, we consider numerous factors, including the
    quantities provided under the contract in relation to our
    business needs, delivery locations per the contract in relation
    to our operating locations, duration of time between entering
    the contract and delivery, past trends and expected future
    demand, and our past practices and customs with regard to such
    contracts. Additionally, we assess whether it is probable that
    the contract will result in physical delivery of the commodity
    and not net financial settlement.

Since our energy derivative contracts could be accounted for in
    three different ways, two of which are elective, our accounting
    method could be different from that used by another party for a
    similar transaction. Furthermore, the accounting method may
    influence the level of volatility in the financial statements
    associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives, as
    generally depicted below:

    Consolidated Financial Statements.



Oil-
    and Gas-Producing Activities

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil-
    and gas-producing activities. Estimated natural gas and oil
    reserves and forward market prices for oil and gas are a
    significant part of our financial calculations. Following are
    examples of how these estimates affect financial results:

•

An increase (decrease) in estimated proved oil and gas reserves
    can reduce (increase) our

unit-of-production

depreciation, depletion, and amortization rates.

•

Changes in oil and gas reserves and forward market prices both
    impact projected future cash flows from our oil and gas
    properties. This, in turn, can impact our periodic impairment
    analyses.

The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very
    complex, requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all
    available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic
    data. After being estimated internally, approximately
    94 percent of our domestic reserve estimates are audited by
    independent experts. (See Part I, Item 1 for further
    discussion.) The data may change substantially over time as a
    result of numerous factors, including additional development
    cost and activity, evolving production history, and a continual
    reassessment of the viability of production under changing
    economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing
    reserve estimates could occur from time to time. Such changes
    could trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties and
    have an impact on our

depreciation, depletion, and
    amortization

expense prospectively. For example, a change of
    approximately 10 percent in our total oil and gas reserves could
    change our annual

depreciation, depletion, and amortization

expense between approximately $77 million and
    $94 million. The actual impact would depend on the specific
    basins impacted and whether the change resulted from proved
    developed, proved undeveloped, or a combination of these reserve
    categories.

Forward market prices, which are utilized in our impairment
    analyses, include estimates of prices for periods that extend
    beyond those with quoted market prices. This forward market
    price information is consistent with that generally used in
    evaluating our drilling decisions and acquisition plans. These
    market prices for future periods impact the production economics
    underlying oil and gas reserve estimates. The prices of natural
    gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period, thus
    impacting our estimates. Significant unfavorable changes in the
    forward price curve could result in an impairment of our oil and
    gas properties.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies,
    including environmental matters, when we assess that a loss is
    probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
    Revisions to contingent liabilities are generally reflected in
    income when new or different facts or information become known
    or circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions
    with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. Liabilities
    for contingent losses are based upon our assumptions and
    estimates and upon advice of legal counsel, engineers, or other
    third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter.
    Areas of significance include certain royalty-related and other
    litigated matters, as well as environmental matters. As new
    developments occur or more information becomes available, our
    assumptions and estimates of these liabilities may change.
    Changes in our assumptions and estimates or outcomes different
    from our current assumptions and estimates could materially
    affect future results of operations for any particular quarterly
    or annual period. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Valuation
    of Deferred Tax Assets and Tax Contingencies

We have deferred tax assets resulting from certain investments
    and businesses that have a tax basis in excess of the book basis
    and from tax carry-forwards generated in the current and prior
    years. We must evaluate whether we will ultimately realize these
    tax benefits and establish a valuation allowance for those that
    may not be realizable. This evaluation considers tax planning
    strategies, including assumptions about the availability and
    character of future taxable income. When assessing the need for
    a valuation allowance, we consider forecasts of future company
    performance, the estimated impact of potential asset
    dispositions, and our ability and intent to execute tax planning
    strategies to utilize tax carryovers. The ultimate amount of
    deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from
    those recorded, as influenced by potential changes in
    jurisdictional income tax laws and the circumstances surrounding
    the actual realization of related tax assets, including the
    impact of organizational or structural changes.



We regularly face challenges from domestic and foreign tax
    authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges
    include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions
    and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We
    evaluate the liability associated with our various filing
    positions by applying the two step process of recognition and
    measurement. The ultimate disposition of these contingencies
    could have a significant impact on operating results and net
    cash flows. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for
    which accruals have been established or were required to pay
    amounts in excess of our accrued liability, our effective tax
    rate in a given financial statement period may be materially
    impacted.

See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information.

Pension
    and Postretirement Obligations

We have employee benefit plans that include pension and other
    postretirement benefits. Net periodic benefit expense and
    obligations for these plans are impacted by various estimates
    and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include the
    expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount
    rates, expected rate of compensation increase, health care cost
    trend rates, and employee demographics, including retirement age
    and mortality. These assumptions are reviewed annually and
    adjustments are made as needed. The assumptions utilized to
    compute expense and the benefit obligations are shown in
    Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following table presents the estimated increase (decrease)
    in net periodic benefit expense and obligations resulting from a
    one-percentage-point change in the specified assumption.

Our expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, as
    determined at the beginning of each fiscal year, are based on
    the average rate of return expected on the funds invested in the
    plans. We determine our long-term expected rate of return on
    plan assets using our expectations of capital market results,
    which includes an analysis of historical results as well as
    forward-looking projections. These capital market expectations
    are based on a long-term period of at least ten years and
    consider our investment strategy and mix of assets, which is
    weighted toward domestic and international equity securities. We
    develop our expectations using input from several external
    sources, including consultation with our third-party independent
    investment consultant. The forward-looking capital market
    projections are developed using a consensus of economists’
    expectations for inflation, GDP growth, and dividend yield along
    with expected changes in risk premiums. The capital market
    return projections for specific asset classes in the investment
    portfolio are then applied to the relative weightings of the
    asset classes in the investment portfolio. The resulting rate is
    an estimate of future results and, thus, likely to be different
    than actual results.

The capital markets continued to improve in 2010 and the benefit
    plans’ assets reflect this improvement. While the 2010
    investment performance was greater than our expected rates of
    return, the expected rates of return on plan assets are
    long-term in nature and are not significantly impacted by
    short-term market performance. Changes to our asset allocation
    would also impact these expected rates of return. Our expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets used for our pension
    plans had been 7.75 percent since 2006. In 2010, we reduced
    our expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets to
    7.5 percent. This reduction was implemented due to changes
    in long-term capital market expectations and our intent to
    slightly reduce the equity exposure and increase the fixed
    income exposure in



the investment portfolio. The 2010 actual return on plan assets
    for our pension plans was a gain of approximately
    12.9 percent. The ten-year average rate of return on
    pension plan assets through December 2010 was approximately
    3.3 percent and is largely affected by the approximately
    34.1 percent loss experienced in 2008.

The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations
    of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The
    objective of the discount rates is to determine the amount, if
    invested at the December 31 measurement date in a portfolio of
    high-quality debt securities, that will provide the necessary
    cash flows when benefit payments are due. Increases in the
    discount rates decrease the obligation and, generally, decrease
    the related expense. The discount rates for our pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans are determined separately
    based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective
    expected benefit cash flows as described in Note 7 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our discount rate
    assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and
    market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term
    high-quality debt securities as well as by the duration of our
    plans’ liabilities.

The expected rate of compensation increase represents average
    long-term salary increases. An increase in this rate causes the
    pension obligation and expense to increase.

The assumed health care cost trend rates are based on national
    trend rates adjusted for our actual historical cost rates and
    plan design. An increase in this rate causes the other
    postretirement benefit obligation and expense to increase.

Fair
    Value Measurements

A limited amount of our energy derivative assets and liabilities
    trade in markets with lower availability of pricing information
    requiring us to use unobservable inputs and are considered
    Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31,
    2010, less than 1 percent of our energy derivative assets
    and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are
    included in Level 3. For Level 2 transactions, we do
    not make significant adjustments to observable prices in
    measuring fair value as we do not generally trade in inactive
    markets.

The determination of fair value for our energy derivative assets
    and liabilities also incorporates the time value of money and
    various credit risk factors which can include the credit
    standing of the counterparties involved, master netting
    arrangements, the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash
    collateral posted and letters of credit) and our nonperformance
    risk on our energy derivative liabilities. The determination of
    the fair value of our energy derivative liabilities does not
    consider noncash collateral credit enhancements. For net
    derivative assets, we apply a credit spread, based on the credit
    rating of the counterparty, against the net derivative asset
    with that counterparty. For net derivative liabilities we apply
    our own credit rating. We derive the credit spreads by using the
    corporate industrial credit curves for each rating category and
    building a curve based on certain points in time for each rating
    category. The spread comes from the discount factor of the
    individual corporate curves versus the discount factor of the
    LIBOR curve. At December 31, 2010, the credit reserve is
    less than $1 million on both our net derivative assets and
    net derivative liabilities. Considering these factors and that
    we do not have significant risk from our net credit exposure to
    derivative counterparties, the impact of credit risk is not
    significant to the overall fair value of our derivatives
    portfolio.

At December 31, 2010, 89 percent of the fair value of
    our derivatives portfolio expires in the next 12 months and
    more than 99 percent expires in the next 24 months.
    Our derivatives portfolio is largely comprised of
    exchange-traded products or like products where price
    transparency has not historically been a concern. Due to the
    nature of the markets in which we transact and the relatively
    short tenure of our derivatives portfolio, we do not believe it
    is necessary to make an adjustment for illiquidity. We regularly
    analyze the liquidity of the markets based on the prevalence of
    broker pricing and exchange pricing for products in our
    derivatives portfolio.

The instruments included in Level 3 at December 31,
    2010, consist of natural gas index transactions that are used to
    manage the physical requirements of our Exploration &
    Production segment. The change in the overall fair value of
    instruments included in Level 3 primarily results from
    changes in commodity prices.

Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement through December 2015 with certain banks that, so long
    as certain conditions are met, serves to reduce our usage of
    cash and other credit facilities for margin requirements related
    to instruments included in the facility.



For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we
    recognized impairments of certain assets that were measured at
    fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These impairment
    measurements are included in Level 3 as they include
    significant unobservable inputs, such as our estimate of future
    cash flows and the probabilities of alternative scenarios. (See
    Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

    marketing and NGL production revenues due to higher average
    energy commodity prices at Williams Partners. Additionally,
    Exploration & Production gas management and production
    revenues increased reflecting an increase in average natural gas
    prices, partially offset by a decrease in production volumes
    sold. NGL and olefin production revenues at Other also increased
    due to higher average

per-unit

prices.



The increase in

costs and operating expenses

is primarily
    due to increased marketing purchases and NGL production
    costs at Williams Partners, reflecting higher average energy
    commodity prices. Exploration & Production costs
    increased primarily due to increased average natural gas prices
    associated with gas management activities. Additionally, NGL and
    olefin production costs at Other increased due to higher average

per-unit

feedstock costs.

Impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets

in 2010
    primarily includes a $1 billion impairment of goodwill and
    $678 million of impairments of certain producing properties
    and acquired unproved reserves at Exploration &
    Production.

Impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets

in 2009
    includes $20 million impairment of certain producing
    properties and acquired unproved reserves at
    Exploration & Production.

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income (loss)

in 2010 includes:

•

$18 million of involuntary conversion gains at Williams
    Partners due to insurance recoveries that are in excess of the
    carrying value of assets;

•

A $12 million gain on the sale of certain assets at
    Williams Partners;

•

A $10 million accrual of a regulatory liability related to
    overcollection of certain employee expenses at Williams Partners.

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income (loss)

in 2009 includes:

•

A $40 million gain on the sale of our Cameron Meadows NGL
    processing plant at Williams Partners;

•

$32 million of penalties from the early termination of
    certain drilling rig contracts at Exploration &
    Production.

General corporate expenses

in 2010 includes
    $45 million of transaction costs associated with our
    strategic restructuring transaction.

The unfavorable change in

operating income (loss)

is
    primarily due to $1.7 billion of impairment charges in 2010
    at Exploration & Production and $45 million of
    transaction costs in 2010 associated with our strategic
    restructuring transaction. The unfavorable change is partially
    offset by an improved energy commodity price environment in 2010
    compared to 2009 and the favorable change in

other (income)
    expense — net

.

The increase in

investing income — net

is
    primarily due to the absence of a $75 million impairment
    charge in 2009 and a $43 million gain in 2010 on the sale
    of our 50 percent interest in Accroven at Other, a
    $27 million increase in equity earnings, primarily at
    Williams Partners, and the absence of an $11 million
    impairment charge in 2009 of a cost-based investment at
    Exploration & Production.

Early debt retirement costs

in 2010 reflect costs related
    to corporate debt retirements associated with our first quarter
    strategic restructuring transaction, including premiums of
    $574 million.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes

changed favorably
    primarily due to the pre-tax loss in 2010 compared to pre-tax
    income in 2009. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the effective tax
    rates compared to the federal statutory rate for both years.

See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for a discussion of the items in

income (loss) from
    discontinued operations

.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

increased reflecting higher results, primarily at WPZ, due
    to an improved energy commodity price environment in 2010
    compared to 2009 as well as the impact of the first-quarter 2009
    impairments and related charges associated with our discontinued
    Venezuela operations.



2009 vs.

Our consolidated results in 2009 declined significantly compared
    to 2008. These results reflect a rapid decline in energy
    commodity prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a
    result of the weakened economy. Energy commodity prices
    generally improved during 2009, but not to levels experienced
    early in 2008.

The decrease in

revenues

is primarily due to decreased
    gas management and production revenues at
    Exploration & Production, reflecting a decrease in
    average natural gas prices, partially offset by an increase in
    production volumes sold. NGL production and marketing revenues
    at Williams Partners, as well as NGL and olefin production
    revenues at Other, also decreased reflecting lower average
    prices.

The decrease in

costs and operating expenses

is primarily
    due to decreased costs at Exploration & Production
    reflecting a decrease in average natural gas prices associated
    with gas management activities, as well as decreased marketing
    purchases and decreased costs associated with our NGL production
    businesses at Williams Partners. In addition, NGL and olefin
    production costs at Other decreased primarily due to lower
    average

per-unit

feedstock costs.

Impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets

in 2008
    includes $143 million of impairments of certain producing
    properties at Exploration & Production and
    $10 million of impairments of certain gathering and
    transportation assets at Williams Partners.

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income (loss)

in 2008 includes:

•

Gain of $148 million on the sale of our Peru interests at
    Exploration & Production;

•

Net gains of $39 million on foreign currency exchanges at
    Other;

•

Income of $32 million related to the partial settlement of
    our Gulf Liquids litigation at Other;

•

Gain of $10 million on the sale of certain south Texas
    assets at Williams Partners;

•

Income of $17 million resulting from involuntary conversion
    gains at Williams Partners;

•

Expense of $23 million related to project development costs
    at Williams Partners.

General corporate expenses

increased primarily due to an
    increase in employee-related expenses, partially offset by a
    decrease in outside services.

The decrease in

operating income (loss)

generally
    reflects an overall unfavorable energy commodity price
    environment in 2009 compared to 2008 and other changes as
    previously discussed.

The decrease in

investing income — net

is
    primarily due to a $75 million impairment charge in 2009 of
    our 50 percent interest in Accroven at Other and an
    $11 million impairment charge in 2009 of a cost-based
    investment at Exploration & Production. (See
    Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) A
    decrease in interest income, primarily due to lower average
    interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008, also contributed to the
    decrease in

investing income — net.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes

changed favorably
    primarily due to lower pre-tax income. See Note 5 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the
    effective tax rates compared to the federal statutory rate for
    both years.

See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for a discussion of the items in

income (loss) from
    discontinued operations

.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

decreased reflecting the first-quarter 2009 impairments and
    related charges associated with our discontinued Venezuela
    operations (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements) and the decline in WPZ’s operating results
    primarily driven by lower NGL margins.



Results
    of Operations — Segments

Williams
    Partners

Our Williams Partners segment includes WPZ, our consolidated
    master limited partnership, which includes two interstate
    natural gas pipelines, as well as investments in natural gas
    pipeline-related companies, which serve regions from the
    San Juan basin in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern
    Colorado to Oregon and Washington and from the Gulf of Mexico to
    the northeastern United States. WPZ also includes natural gas
    gathering and processing and treating facilities and oil
    gathering and transportation facilities located primarily in the
    Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. As
    of December 31, 2010, we currently own approximately
    75 percent of the interests in WPZ, including the interests
    of the general partner, which is wholly owned by us, and
    incentive distribution rights.

Williams Partners’ ongoing strategy is to safely and
    reliably operate large-scale, interstate natural gas
    transmission and midstream infrastructures where our assets can
    be fully utilized and drive low

per-unit

costs. We focus on consistently attracting new business by
    providing highly reliable service to our customers and utilizing
    our low

cost-of-capital

to invest in growing markets, including the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico, the Marcellus Shale, the western United States, and
    areas of increasing natural gas demand.

Williams Partners’ interstate transmission and related
    storage activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as
    such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural
    gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or
    abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among
    other things, are subject to regulation. The rates are
    established through the FERC’s ratemaking process. Changes
    in commodity prices and volumes transported have little
    near-term impact on revenues because the majority of cost of
    service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges
    in transportation rates.

Overview
    of 2010

Significant events during 2010 include the following:

Echo
    Springs Plant Expansion

New capacity from our expansion of the Echo Springs facility
    began service in the fourth quarter of 2010. The addition of the
    fourth cryogenic processing train added approximately

350 MMcf/d

of processing capacity and 30 Mbbls/d of NGL production
    capacity, nearly doubling Echo Spring’s capacities in both
    cases. Approximately

70 MMcf/d

of production from Exploration & Production in the
    Piceance basin is currently being processed at the Echo Springs
    facility for a volumetric-based fee. While a slow-down in
    Wamsutter area drilling has resulted in some unused capacity, we
    are exploring ways to bring more natural gas to this facility in
    the coming year.

Marcellus
    Shale Gathering Asset Acquisition

In the fourth quarter of 2010 we acquired a gathering business
    in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian basin
    for $150 million. The business includes 75 miles of
    gathering pipelines and two compressor stations which currently
    gathers approximately

235 MMcf/d.

We have agreed to a new long-term dedicated gathering agreement
    with the seller for its production in the northeast Pennsylvania
    area of the Marcellus Shale. The acquired system will connect
    into the Transco pipeline through our Springville gathering
    pipeline, currently under construction in the Appalachian basin.

Piceance
    Acquisition

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed the purchase of
    certain gathering and processing assets in the Piceance basin
    from Exploration & Production as discussed in
    Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In
    conjunction with this purchase, we entered into a gathering and
    processing agreement with Exploration & Production,
    such that future gathering and processing revenues will be at a
    higher, market-based rate. Prior periods reflect gathering and
    processing revenues at an internal cost of service rate.



Perdido
    Norte

Our Perdido Norte project, in the western deepwater of the Gulf
    of Mexico, began

start-up

of
    operations late in the first quarter of 2010. The project
    includes a

200 MMcf/d

expansion of our onshore Markham gas processing facility and a
    total of 179 miles of deepwater oil and gas lines that
    expand the scale of our existing infrastructure. Shortly after
    an initial startup, during the second quarter, production was
    suspended by the operator of the deepwater producing platforms
    to address facility issues and the third quarter was impacted by
    further delays. While these issues have been resolved and both
    oil and gas production is currently flowing, production has been
    impacted in part by the drilling moratorium and the
    producer’s technical issues, and has not increased as
    quickly as expected. We anticipate volumes to increase
    significantly, however, during 2011.

Impact of
    Gulf Oil Spill

Our transportation and processing assets in the Gulf of Mexico
    were not physically impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
    Operations are normal at all facilities, and we did not
    experience any operational or logistical issues that hindered
    the safety of our employees or facilities. The drilling
    moratorium, in force from May to October, in the Gulf of Mexico
    impacted the financial performance of our operations through
    production delays which reduced natural gas and oil growth
    volumes in 2010. Protracted delays in permitting and drilling
    could continue to impact our future growth volumes. While we
    continue to carefully monitor the events and business
    environment in the Gulf of Mexico for potential negative
    impacts, we also continue to pursue major expansion and growth
    opportunities in that region.

Overland
    Pass Pipeline

In September 2010, we completed the $424 million
    acquisition of an additional 49 percent ownership interest
    in OPPL, which increased our ownership interest to
    50 percent. In 2006, we entered into an agreement to
    develop new pipeline capacity for transporting NGLs from
    production areas in the Rocky Mountain area to central Kansas.
    Our partner reimbursed us for the development costs we had
    incurred for the proposed pipeline and acquired 99 percent
    of the pipeline. We retained a 1 percent interest and the
    option to increase our ownership to 50 percent within two
    years of the pipeline becoming operational in November of 2008.
    As long as we retain a 50 percent ownership interest in
    OPPL, we have the right to become operator. We have notified our
    partner of our intent to operate and are currently working on an
    early 2011 transition. Work is also under way to determine
    optimal expansions to serve producers in the OPPL corridor. OPPL
    includes a

760-mile

NGL
    pipeline from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid-Continent NGL market
    center in Conway, Kansas, along with 150- and

125-mile

extensions into the Piceance and Denver-Joules basins in
    Colorado, respectively. Our equity NGL volumes from our two
    Wyoming plants and our Willow Creek facility in Colorado are
    dedicated for transport on OPPL under a long-term shipping
    agreement.

Volatile
    commodity prices

Average

per-unit

NGL
    margins in 2010 are significantly higher than in 2009,
    benefiting from a period of increasing average NGL prices while
    abundant natural gas supplies limited the increase in natural
    gas prices. Benefits from favorable natural gas price
    differentials in the Rocky Mountain area have narrowed since the
    second quarter of 2009 such that our realized

per-unit

margins are only slightly greater than that of the industry
    benchmarks for natural gas processed in the Henry Hub area and
    for liquids fractionated and sold at Mont Belvieu, Texas.

NGL margins are defined as NGL revenues less any applicable BTU
    replacement cost, plant fuel, and third-party transportation and
    fractionation.

Per-unit

NGL
    margins are calculated based on sales of our own equity volumes
    at the processing plants.

Williams
    Pipeline Partners L.P.

During the third quarter, WPZ consummated its merger with WMZ.
    As a result, WMZ is wholly owned by WPZ and is no longer
    publicly traded.

Mobile
    Bay South project

In May 2010, a compression facility in Alabama allowing natural
    gas pipeline transportation service to various southbound
    delivery points was placed into service. The cost of the project
    was $32 million and increased capacity by 254 thousand
    dekatherms per day (Mdt/d).

Sundance
    Trail project

In November 2009, approval was received from the FERC to
    construct approximately 16 miles of

30-inch

pipeline between existing compressor stations in Wyoming. The
    project also includes an upgrade to the existing compressor
    station. The total estimated cost of the project is
    approximately $50 million. The project was placed in
    service in November 2010 with an increase in capacity of 150
    Mdt/d.

Outlook
    for 2011

The following factors could impact our business in 2011.

Commodity
    price changes

•

We expect our average

per-unit

NGL
    margins in 2011 to be higher than our rolling five-year average

per-unit

NGL
    margins. NGL price changes have historically tracked somewhat
    with changes in the price of crude oil, although NGL, crude and
    natural gas prices are highly volatile and difficult to predict.
    NGL margins are highly dependent upon continued demand
    within the global economy. However, NGL products are
    currently the preferred feedstock for ethylene and propylene
    production, which has been shifting away from the more expensive
    crude-based feedstocks. Bolstered by abundant long-term domestic
    natural gas supplies, we expect to benefit from these dynamics
    in the broader global petrochemical markets.



Gathering,
    processing, and NGL sales volumes

•

The growth of natural gas supplies supporting our gathering and
    processing volumes are impacted by producer drilling activities.

•

We anticipate growth in our onshore businesses’ gas
    gathering and processing volumes as our infrastructure grows to
    support drilling activities in the Piceance and Appalachian
    basins. However, we anticipate no change or slight declines in
    basins in the Rocky Mountain and Four Corners areas due to
    reduced drilling activity. Due to the high proportion of
    fee-based processing agreements in the Piceance basin, we
    anticipate only a slight increase in NGL equity sales volumes.

•

In our Gulf Coast businesses, we expect higher gas gathering,
    processing and crude transportation volumes as our Perdido Norte
    pipelines move into a full year of operation and other
    in-process drilling is completed. However, permitting and
    production delays related to the drilling moratorium which was
    in force from May to October, 2010 continue to hamper growth.
    While we expect an overall increase in processed gas volumes in
    2011, NGL equity volumes are expected to be lower as we
    anticipate a major contract to change from keep-whole to
    fee-based processing.

Expansion
    projects

We have planned capital and investment expenditures of
    $1,090 million to $1,370 million in 2011 including
    expenditures related to our newly acquired gathering system in
    the Marcellus Shale as well as our Laurel Mountain Midstream,
    LLC (Laurel Mountain) equity investment. We also plan to pursue
    major expansion and growth opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico,
    as well as in the Piceance basin in conjunction with both
    Exploration & Production’s and third-party
    drilling programs. The ongoing major expansion projects include:

    North

An expansion of our existing natural gas transmission system
    from Alabama to various delivery points as far north as North
    Carolina. The cost of the project is estimated to be
    approximately $236 million. Phase I service was placed into
    service in July 2010 and increased capacity by 90 Mdt/d.
    Phase II service is anticipated to begin in May 2011 and
    will increase capacity by 219 Mdt/d.

Mobile
    Bay South II

Additional compression facilities and modifications to existing
    facilities in Alabama allowing natural gas transportation
    service to various southbound delivery points. In July 2010, we
    received approval from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
    Commission. Construction began in October 2010 and is estimated
    to cost $35 million. The estimated project in-service date
    is May 2011 and will increase capacity by 380 Mdt/d.

Mid-South

In October 2010, we filed an application with the FERC to
    upgrade compressor facilities and expand our existing natural
    gas transmission system from Alabama to markets as far north as
    North Carolina. The cost of the project is estimated to be
    $219 million. The project is expected to be phased into
    service in September 2012 and June 2013, with an increase in
    capacity of 225 Mdt/d.

Mid-Atlantic
    Connector

In November 2010, we filed an application with the FERC to
    expand our existing natural gas transmission system from North
    Carolina to markets as far downstream as Maryland. The cost of
    the project is estimated to be $55 million and will
    increase capacity by 142 Mdt/d. We plan to place the project
    into service in November 2012.

Marcellus
    Shale

In the Appalachian basin, $150 million was added to our
    planned expansion capital to fund the 2011 construction phase of
    additional gathering assets, including compression and
    dehydration. In conjunction with a



long-term agreement with a significant producer, we will
    construct and operate a

33-mile

natural gas gathering pipeline in the Marcellus Shale region
    which will connect our recently acquired gathering assets in
    Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale into the Transco pipeline.
    In order to pursue future opportunities, the project has been
    increased from a

20-inch

diameter to a

24-inch

diameter pipeline. Construction on the pipeline is expected to
    begin in the first quarter of 2011 and be completed during 2011.

Laurel
    Mountain

Capital to be invested within our Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC
    (Laurel Mountain) equity investment to enable the rapid
    expansion of our gathering system including the initial stages
    of projects that are planned to provide approximately
    1.5 Bcf/d of gathering capacity and 1,400 miles of
    gathering lines, including 400 new miles of

6-inch

to

24-inch

diameter pipeline. Construction has begun on our Shamrock
    compressor station with an initial capacity of

60 MMcf/d,

expandable to

350 MMcf/d,

which will likely be the largest central delivery point out of
    the Laurel Mountain system.

We have several other proposed projects to meet customer demands
    in addition to the various in-progress expansion projects
    previously discussed. Subject to regulatory approvals,
    construction of some of these projects could begin in 2011.

Recast as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements

2010 vs.

The increase in

segment revenues

includes:

•

A $699 million increase in marketing revenues primarily due
    to higher average NGL and crude prices. These changes are more
    than offset by similar changes in marketing purchases.

•

A $330 million increase in revenues associated with the
    production of NGLs reflecting an increase of $335 million
    associated with a 41 percent increase in average NGL

per-unit

sales prices.

•

A $56 million increase in fee revenues primarily due to
    higher gathering revenue in the Piceance basin as a result of
    permitted increases in the

cost-of-service

gathering rate in 2010.

The increase in s

egment costs and expenses

of
    $884 million includes:

•

A $721 million increase in marketing purchases primarily
    due to higher average NGL and crude prices. These changes are
    substantially offset by similar changes in marketing revenues.

•

A $107 million increase in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs reflecting an increase of $101 million
    associated with a 30 percent increase in average natural
    gas prices.

•

A $19 million increase in operating costs including
    $12 million higher depreciation primarily due to the new
    Perdido Norte pipelines and a full year of depreciation on our
    Willow Creek facility which was placed into service in the
    latter part of 2009.

•

A $14 million unfavorable change related to the disposal of
    assets reflecting the absence of a $40 million gain on the
    sale of our Cameron Meadows processing plant in 2009, partially
    offset by smaller gains in 2010. Gains recognized in 2010
    include involuntary conversion gains due to insurance recoveries
    in excess of the carrying value of our Gulf assets which were
    damaged by Hurricane Ike in 2008 and our



Ignacio plant, which was damaged by a fire in 2007, as well as
    gains associated with sales of certain assets in Colorado’s
    Piceance basin.

The increase in William Partners’

segment profit

includes:

•

$223 million of higher NGL production margins reflecting
    higher NGL prices, partially offset by increased production
    costs associated with higher natural gas prices. NGL equity
    volumes were slightly higher due primarily to new production at
    Willow Creek, partially offset by the absence of favorable
    customer contractual changes and decreasing inventory levels in
    2009.

•

$28 million increase in equity earnings, including a
    $10 million increase from Discovery primarily due to higher
    processing margins and new volumes from the Tahiti pipeline
    lateral expansion completed in 2009. In addition, equity
    earnings from Aux Sable Liquid Products LP (Aux Sable) are
    $10 million higher primarily due to higher processing
    margins, and equity earnings from our increased investment in
    OPPL were $5 million.

•

A $56 million increase in fee revenues as previously
    discussed.

•

A $22 million decrease in margins related to the marketing
    of NGLs and crude primarily due to lower favorable changes in
    pricing while product was in transit in 2010 as compared to 2009.

•

A $19 million increase in operating costs as previously
    discussed.

•

A $14 million unfavorable change related to the disposal of
    assets as previously discussed.

2009 vs.

The decrease in segment revenues includes:

•

A $716 million decrease in revenues associated with the
    production of NGLs primarily due to lower average NGL prices.

•

A $513 million decrease in marketing revenues primarily due
    to lower average NGL and crude prices, partially offset by
    higher NGL volumes.

•

A $53 million decrease in revenues from lower
    transportation imbalance settlements in 2009 compared to 2008
    (

offset in costs and operating expenses

).

•

A $65 million increase in fee revenues primarily due to
    higher volumes resulting from connecting new supplies in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico in the latter part of 2008 and new fees
    for processing the Exploration & Production
    segment’s natural gas production at Willow Creek.

•

A $17 million increase in transportation revenues
    associated with expansion projects placed into service in 2009.

The decrease in s

egment costs and expenses

of
    $1,132 million includes:

•

A $643 million decrease in marketing purchases primarily
    due to lower average NGL and crude prices, including the absence
    of a $9 million charge in 2008 to write down the value of
    NGL inventories, partially offset by higher NGL volumes.

•

A $435 million decrease in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs primarily due to lower average natural gas
    prices.

•

A $53 million decrease in costs associated with lower
    transportation imbalance settlements in 2009 compared to 2008
    (

offset in segment revenues

).

•

A $40 million gain on the 2009 sale of our Cameron Meadows
    processing plant.

•

The absence of $17 million of charges in 2008 related to an
    impairment, asset abandonments, and asset retirement obligations.



The decrease in William Partners’ segment profit includes:

•

$281 million of lower NGL production margins reflecting a
    decrease in energy commodity prices in 2009 compared to 2008.

•

$124 million in higher margins related to the marketing of
    NGLs primarily due to favorable changes in pricing while product
    was in transit during 2009 as compared to significant
    unfavorable changes in pricing while product was in transit in
    2008 and the absence of a $9 million charge in 2008 to
    write down the value of NGL inventories.

•

A $40 million gain in 2009 on the sale of our Cameron
    Meadows processing plant, partially offset by the absence of a
    $5 million involuntary conversion gain in 2008 related to
    our Cameron Meadows plant.

Exploration &
    Production

Exploration & Production includes the natural gas
    development, production and gas management activities primarily
    in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States, natural gas development activities in the northeastern
    portion of the United States, oil and natural gas interests in
    South America, and more recently, oil development activities in
    the northern United States. The gas management activities
    include procuring fuel and shrink gas for our midstream
    businesses and providing marketing services to third parties,
    such as producers. Additionally, gas management activities
    include the managing of various natural gas related contracts
    such as transportation, storage and related hedges.

Overview
    of 2010

Domestic production revenues for 2010 were higher than 2009
    primarily due to higher realized average prices on our natural
    gas production, partially offset by lower production volumes.

Segment profit (loss)

for 2010 includes approximately
    $1.7 billion in impairments of natural gas properties and
    goodwill (see further discussion below), while 2009 included
    expense of $32 million associated with contractual
    penalties from the early termination of drilling rig contracts.
    Highlights of the comparative periods, primarily related to our
    production activities, include:

Realized average prices include market prices, net of fuel and
    shrink and hedge gains and losses. The realized hedge gain per
    Mcfe was $0.81 and $1.43 for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2010, we entered into an agreement
    to acquire additional leasehold acreage positions and a
    5 percent overriding royalty interest associated with these
    acreage positions. These acquisitions nearly double our acreage
    holdings in the Marcellus Shale and closed in July for
    $599 million, including closing adjustments. During 2010,
    we also spent a total of $164 million to acquire additional
    unproved leasehold acreage in the Marcellus Shale.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we acquired a company that
    holds a major acreage position (approximately 85,800 net
    acres, most of which is undeveloped) in North Dakota’s
    Bakken Shale oil play (Williston basin) that will diversify our
    interests into light, sweet crude oil production. The purchase
    price was approximately $949 million, including closing
    adjustments.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed the sale of
    certain gathering and processing assets in the Piceance basin to
    WPZ for consideration of $702 million in cash and
    approximately 1.8 million common units. See



Note 1 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In
    conjunction with this sale, we entered into a gathering and
    processing agreement with WPZ. Gathering and processing costs
    prior to the sale reflect an internal

cost-of-service

rate. Subsequent to the closing date of the sale, gathering and
    processing costs will be at a higher, market-based rate.

As a result of significant declines in forward natural gas
    prices during third quarter 2010, we performed an interim
    assessment of our capitalized costs related to property and
    goodwill. As a result of these assessments, we recorded a
    $503 million impairment charge related to the capitalized
    costs of our Barnett Shale properties and a $175 million
    impairment charge related to capitalized costs of acquired
    unproved reserves in the Piceance Highlands, which were acquired
    in 2008. Additionally, we fully impaired our goodwill in the
    amount of $1 billion. These impairments were based on our
    assessment of estimated future discounted cash flows and other
    information. See Notes 4 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a further discussion of the impairments.

Outlook
    for 2011

We have the following expectations for 2011:

•

Natural gas prices to remain at levels similar to 2010.

•

Increase capital expenditures in 2011 over levels (before
    acquisitions) in 2010 to develop positions that were acquired in
    the Appalachian and Williston basins in 2010.

•

Continuation of our development drilling program in the
    Appalachian, Piceance, Fort Worth, Powder River, and
    San Juan basins. Our total capital expenditures for 2011
    are projected to be between $1.15 billion and
    $1.75 billion. We expect to maintain three to five drilling
    rigs in our newly acquired Williston basin properties with
    related capital expenditures expected to be between
    $200 million and $300 million.

•

Annual average daily domestic production expected to increase
    approximately 9 percent over 2010.

Risks to achieving our expectations include unfavorable energy
    commodity price movements which are impacted by numerous
    factors, including weather conditions, domestic natural gas, oil
    and NGL production levels and demand. A significant decline in
    natural gas, oil and NGL prices would impact these expectations
    for 2011, although the impact would be somewhat mitigated by our
    hedging program, which hedges a significant portion of our
    expected production. In addition, changes in laws and
    regulations may impact our development drilling program.

Purchase
    Commitments

In connection with a gathering agreement entered into by
    Williams Partners with a third party in December 2010, we
    concurrently agreed to buy up to 200,000 MMBtu/d of natural
    gas priced at market prices from the same third party. Purchases
    under the

12-year

contract are expected to begin in the third quarter of 2011. We
    expect to sell this natural gas in the open market and may
    utilize available transportation capacity to facilitate the
    sales.



Commodity
    Price Risk Strategy

To manage the commodity price risk and volatility of owning
    producing gas and oil properties, we enter into derivative
    contracts for a portion of our future production. For 2011, we
    have the following contracts for our daily domestic production,
    shown at weighted average volumes and basin-level weighted

    200,000 MMbtu per day of gas to a buyer at the White River
    Hub (Greasewood-Meeker, CO), which is the major market hub
    exiting the Piceance basin. Our interests in the Piceance basin
    hold sufficient reserves to meet this obligation.

Recast as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

2010 vs.

The increase in total

segment revenues

is primarily due
    to the following:

•

The increase in domestic production revenues reflects an
    increase of $156 million associated with an 8 percent
    increase in realized average prices including the effect of
    hedges, partially offset by a decrease of $89 million
    associated with a 4 percent decrease in production volumes
    sold. Production revenues in 2010 and 2009 include approximately
    $202 million and $93 million, respectively, related to
    NGLs and approximately $57 million and $38 million,
    respectively, related to condensate. The increase related to
    NGLs is primarily due to higher volumes in the Piceance basin
    processed by Williams Partners’ Willow Creek facility,
    which was placed into service in the latter part of 2009;

•

The increase in gas management revenues is primarily due to an
    increase in physical natural gas revenue as a result of a
    21 percent increase in average prices on physical natural
    gas sales. This is primarily related to gas sales associated
    with our transportation and storage contracts and is offset by a
    similar increase in

segment costs and expenses

;

Total

segment costs and expenses

increased
    $2,094 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$1,684 million due to 2010 impairments of property and
    goodwill as previously discussed. In 2009, $20 million of
    impairments were recorded in the Fort Worth and Arkoma
    basins;

•

$278 million increase in gas management expenses, primarily
    due to an 19 percent increase in average prices on physical
    natural gas purchases. This increase is primarily related to the
    gas purchases associated with our previously discussed
    transportation and storage contracts and is more than offset by
    a similar increase in

segment revenues

. Gas management
    expenses in 2010 and 2009 include $48 million and
    $21 million, respectively, related to charges for
    unutilized pipeline capacity;

•

$76 million higher gathering, processing, and
    transportation expenses primarily as a result of processing
    natural gas liquids at Williams Partners’ Willow Creek
    plant, which began processing in August 2009, and higher rates
    charged on gathering and processing associated with certain
    gathering and processing assets in the Piceance basin that were
    sold to WPZ in the fourth quarter of 2010;

•

$44 million higher severance and ad valorem taxes primarily
    due to higher average market prices, excluding the impact of
    hedges;

•

$30 million higher lease and other operating expenses
    primarily due to increased workover and maintenance activity;

•

$27 million higher depreciation, depletion, and
    amortization expenses primarily due to a change in prior
    production volumes and higher depreciable costs used in the
    calculation of depreciation, depletion, and amortization
    expenses.



Partially offsetting the increased costs is a decrease due to
    the absence of $32 million of expenses in 2009 related to
    penalties from the early release of drilling rigs as previously
    discussed.

The $1,734 million decrease in s

egment profit (loss)

is primarily due to the impairments, partially offset by an
    8 percent increase in realized average domestic prices on
    production and the other previously discussed changes in

segment revenues

and

segment costs and expenses.

2009 vs.

The decrease in total

segment revenues

is primarily due
    to the following:

•

$726 million, or 26 percent, decrease in domestic
    production revenues reflecting $946 million associated with
    a 31 percent decrease in realized average prices, partially
    offset by an increase of $220 million associated with an
    8 percent increase in production volumes sold. Production
    revenues in 2009 and 2008 include approximately $93 million
    and $85 million, respectively, related to NGLs and
    approximately $38 million and $62 million,
    respectively, related to condensate. While NGL volumes were
    significantly higher than the prior year, NGL prices were
    significantly lower;

•

$1,788 million, or 55 percent, decrease in gas
    management revenues primarily due to a decrease in physical
    natural gas revenue as a result of a 56 percent decrease in
    average prices on physical natural gas sales, slightly offset by
    a 2 percent increase in natural gas sales volumes. This is
    primarily related to gas sales associated with our
    transportation and storage contracts and is substantially offset
    by a similar decrease in

segment costs and expenses

.

The decrease in

net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

gains (losses) and ineffectiveness

is primarily related to
    the absence of a $10 million favorable impact in 2008 for
    the initial consideration of our own nonperformance risk in
    estimating the fair value of our derivative liabilities.

Total

segment costs and expenses

decreased
    $1,651 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$1,752 million decrease in gas management expenses,
    primarily due to a 55 percent decrease in average prices on
    physical natural gas purchases, slightly offset by a
    2 percent increase in natural gas purchase volumes. This
    decrease is primarily related to the gas purchases associated
    with our previously discussed transportation and storage
    contracts and is more than offset by a similar decrease in

segment revenues

. Gas management expenses in 2009 and
    2008 include $21 million and $8 million, respectively,
    related to charges for unutilized pipeline capacity. Gas
    management expenses in 2009 and 2008 also include
    $7 million and $35 million, respectively, related to
    adjustments to the carrying value of natural gas inventories in
    storage;

•

$166 million lower operating taxes due primarily to
    56 percent lower average market prices (excluding the
    impact of hedges), partially offset by higher production volumes
    sold. The lower operating taxes include a net decrease of
    $39 million reflecting a $34 million charge in 2008
    and $5 million of favorable revisions in 2009 relating to
    Wyoming severance and ad valorem tax issues;

•

$143 million due to the absence of property impairments
    recorded in 2008 in the Arkoma basin;

•

$6 million lower SG&A expenses, which include lower
    bad debt expense related to the partial recovery of certain
    receivables previously reserved for in 2008 resulting from a
    bankrupt counterparty.

Partially offsetting the decreased costs are increases due to
    the following:

•

The absence of a $148 million gain recorded in 2008
    associated with the sale of our Peru interests;

•

$145 million higher depreciation, depletion, and
    amortization expense primarily due to the impact of higher
    capitalized drilling costs from prior years and higher
    production volumes compared to the prior year. Also, we recorded
    an additional $17 million of depreciation, depletion, and
    amortization in the



fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to new SEC reserves
    reporting rules. Our proved reserves decreased primarily due to
    the new SEC reserves reporting rules and the related price
    impact;

•

$57 million higher gathering, processing and transportation
    expense primarily due to higher production volumes and the
    processing fees for natural gas liquids at Williams
    Partners’ Willow Creek plant, which began processing in
    August 2009;

•

$32 million of expense related to penalties from the early
    release of drilling rigs as previously discussed;

•

$31 million higher exploratory expense in 2009, primarily
    related to $20 million of increased seismic costs and
    $12 million related to higher amortization and the
    write-off of lease acquisition costs. Dry hole costs for 2009
    and 2008 were $11 million and $12 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we have
    approximately $14 million of capitalized drilling costs and
    $24 million of undeveloped leasehold costs related to
    continuing exploratory activities in the Paradox basin;

•

$20 million of impairment costs in the Fort Worth and
    Arkoma basins. We recorded a $15 million impairment in 2009
    related to costs of acquired unproved reserves resulting from a
    2008 acquisition in the Fort Worth basin. This impairment
    was based on our assessment of estimated future discounted cash
    flows and additional information obtained from drilling and
    other activities in 2009. We also recorded a $5 million
    impairment in the Arkoma basin in 2009 related to facilities.

The $862 million decrease in segment profit is primarily
    due to the 31 percent decrease in realized average domestic
    prices and the other previously discussed changes in segment
    revenues and segment costs and expenses.

Other

Other includes other business activities that are not operating
    segments, primarily our Canadian midstream and domestic olefins
    operations and a 25.5 percent interest in Gulfstream, as
    well as corporate operations.

Segment profit (loss)

for
    the year ended December 31, 2010, has improved compared to
    the prior year primarily due to $139 million higher NGL and
    olefins production margins resulting from significantly higher
    average

per-unit

margins on lower volumes and the net impact of recognizing
    $43 million in gains on the Accroven investment in 2010
    while recording a $75 million impairment charge on that
    investment in 2009.

Significant events for 2010 include the following:

Sale of
    Accroven

Considering the deteriorating circumstances in Venezuela, in
    2009 we fully impaired our $75 million investment in
    Accroven SRL, a Venezuelan operation. (See Note 2 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.) In June of 2010, we sold
    our 50 percent interest in Accroven to the state-owned oil
    company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) for
    $107 million. Of this amount, $13 million was received
    in cash at closing and another $30 million was received in
    August 2010. The remainder is due in six quarterly payments
    beginning October 31, 2010. The first quarterly payment of
    $11 million was received in January 2011 and will be
    recognized as income in 2011. We will continue to recognize the
    resulting gain as cash is received. Accroven was not part of our
    operations that were expropriated by the Venezuelan government
    in May 2009.

Completion
    of the butylene/butane splitter facility in Canada

The new butylene/butane splitter and hydro-treating facility was
    placed into service in August 2010. The butylene/butane splitter
    further fractionates the butylene/butane mix product produced at
    our Redwater fractionators near Edmonton, Alberta, into separate
    butylene and butane products, which receive higher values and
    are in greater demand. The source of the product fractionated at
    Redwater is our oil sands off-gas extraction facility near
    Ft. McMurray, Alberta.

Outlook
    for 2011

The following factors could impact our business in 2011.



Commodity
    price changes

We anticipate average

per-unit

margins in 2011 will be consistent with the 2010 levels. Margins
    in our Canadian midstream and domestic olefins business are
    highly dependent upon continued demand within the global
    economy. NGL products are currently the preferred feedstock for
    ethylene and propylene production which has been shifting away
    from the more expensive crude-based feedstocks. Bolstered by
    abundant long-term domestic natural gas supplies, we expect to
    benefit from these dynamics in the broader global petrochemical
    markets because of our NGL-based olefins production.

Allocation
    of capital to projects

We expect to spend $380 million to $480 million in
    2011 on capital projects. The major expansion projects include a

12-inch

diameter pipeline in Canada, which will transport recovered NGLs
    and olefins from our extraction plant in Ft. McMurray to
    our Redwater fractionation facility. The pipeline will have
    sufficient capacity to transport additional recovered liquids in
    excess of those from our current agreements. Construction has
    begun and we anticipate an in-service date in 2012.

2010 vs.

Segment revenues

increased primarily due to:

•

$307 million higher NGL and olefins production revenues
    resulting from higher average

per-unit

prices. The new butylene/butane splitter began producing and
    selling both butylene and butane in August 2010 and resulted in
    $22 million additional sales revenues over the 2009
    butylene/butane mix product sold.

•

$27 million higher marketing revenues due to general
    increases in energy commodity prices on slightly higher volumes.
    The higher marketing revenues were more than offset by similar
    changes in marketing purchases described below.

Partially offsetting the increased revenue was a
    $57 million decrease from lower sales volumes primarily due
    to:

•

11 percent lower Gulf ethylene sales volumes, including the
    impact of a four-week plant maintenance outage at our Geismar
    plant during the fourth quarter of 2010.

•

12 percent lower propylene volumes sold primarily due to
    the absence of certain large 2009 propylene inventory sales and
    lower volumes available for processing at our Gulf propylene
    splitter.

Segment costs and expenses

increased $150 million
    primarily as a result of:

•

$156 million higher NGL and olefins production product
    costs resulting from higher average

per-unit

feedstock costs.

•

$29 million increased marketing purchases due to general
    increases in energy commodity prices on slightly higher volumes.
    The increased marketing purchases more than offset similar
    changes in marketing revenues.

•

$7 million higher operating and general and administrative
    costs in our Canadian midstream and domestic olefins operations.

Partially offsetting the increased costs are decreases due to:

•

$45 million of reduced product costs resulting from the
    lower sales volumes described above.



•

$6 million favorable customer settlement in 2010.

The favorable change in

segment profit (loss)

is
    primarily due to $139 million higher NGL and olefins
    production margins resulting from significantly higher average

per-unit

margins on lower volumes and the net impact of recognizing
    $43 million in gains on the Accroven investment in 2010
    while recording a $75 million impairment charge on that
    investment in 2009.

2009 vs.

Segment revenues

decreased primarily due to:

•

A $457 million decrease in NGL and olefins production
    revenues resulting from lower average product prices, partially
    offset by higher volumes.

•

A $19 million decrease in marketing revenues primarily due
    to lower average NGL and olefin prices, partially offset by
    higher NGL and olefin volumes.

Segment costs and expenses

decreased $413 million
    primarily as a result of:

•

A $445 million decrease in costs in our NGL and olefins
    production business primarily due to lower

per-unit

feedstock costs, including the absence of an $11 million
    charge in 2008 to write-down the value of olefin inventories,
    partially offset by higher volumes.

•

A $34 million decrease in marketing purchases primarily due
    to lower average NGL and olefin prices, including the absence of
    an $11 million charge in 2008 to write-down the value of
    our NGL inventories, partially offset by higher volumes.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

A $39 million unfavorable change primarily due to foreign
    currency exchange gains in 2008 related to the revaluation of
    current assets held in U.S. dollars within our Canadian
    operations.

•

The absence of $32 million of income in 2008 related to the
    partial settlement of our Gulf Liquids litigation (see
    Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

The unfavorable change in segment profit (loss) was primarily
    due to:

•

A $75 million loss from investment related to the 2009
    impairment of our investment in Accroven.

•

A $39 million unfavorable change primarily due to foreign
    currency exchange gains in 2008 related to the revaluation of
    current assets held in U.S. dollars within our Canadian
    operations.

•

The absence of $32 million of income in 2008 related to the
    partial settlement of our Gulf Liquids litigation.

•

A $12 million decrease in NGL and olefins production
    margins primarily due to lower average prices, partially offset
    by lower

per-unit

feedstock costs, including the absence of an $11 million
    charge in 2008 to write-down the value of olefin production
    inventories, and higher volumes in 2009 related to the impact of
    third-party operational issues in 2008 that reduced off-gas
    supplies to our plant in Canada.

•

The absence of an $8 million gain recognized in 2008
    related to a final earn-out payment on a 2005 asset sale.

These decreases were partially offset by $15 million higher
    marketing margins in our NGL and olefins production business
    primarily due to the absence of an $11 million charge in
    2008 to write-down the value of NGL inventories.



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
    Liquidity

Overview

In 2010, we continued to focus upon growth through disciplined
    investments in our businesses. Examples of this growth included:

•

Continued investment in Exploration &
    Production’s development drilling programs, as well as
    acquisitions that expanded our presence in the Marcellus Shale
    and provided our initial entry into the Bakken Shale areas.

•

Expansion of Williams Partners’ interstate natural gas
    pipeline system to meet the demand of growth markets.

•

Continued investment in Williams Partners’ deepwater Gulf
    expansion projects, gas processing capacity in the western
    United States, infrastructure in the Marcellus Shale area and
    increased ownership in OPPL.

These investments were funded through cash flow from operations,
    debt and equity offerings at WPZ and cash on hand.

During 2010, the overall economic recession has impacted us. In
    consideration of our liquidity under these conditions, we note
    the following:

•

As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately
    $800 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
    $2.7 billion of available credit capacity under our credit
    facilities. Our $900 million credit facility does not
    expire until May 2012, and WPZ’s $1.75 billion credit
    facility does not expire until February 2013. Additionally,
    Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement that serves to reduce our margin requirements related
    to our hedging activities. (See additional discussion in the
    following Available Liquidity section.)

•

Our credit exposure to derivative counterparties is partially
    mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral support.
    (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Outlook

For 2011, we expect operating cash flows to be stronger than
    2010 levels.

Lower-than-expected

energy commodity prices would be somewhat mitigated by certain
    of our cash flow streams that are substantially insulated from
    short-term changes in commodity prices as follows:

•

Firm demand and capacity reservation transportation revenues
    under long-term contracts from our gas pipelines;

•

Hedged natural gas sales at Exploration & Production
    related to a significant portion of its production;

•

Fee-based revenues from certain gathering and processing
    services in our midstream businesses.

We believe we have, or have access to, the financial resources
    and liquidity necessary to meet our requirements for working
    capital, capital and investment expenditures, and tax and debt
    payments while maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity. In
    particular, we note the following assumptions for the year:

•

We expect to maintain consolidated liquidity (which includes
    liquidity at WPZ) of at least $1 billion from

cash and
    cash equivalents

and unused revolving credit facilities;

•

We expect to fund capital and investment expenditures, debt
    payments, dividends, and working capital requirements primarily
    through cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents on
    hand, utilization of our revolving credit facilities, and
    proceeds from debt issuances and sales of equity securities as
    needed. Based on a range of market assumptions, we currently
    estimate our cash flow from operations will be between
    $2.5 billion and $3.3 billion in 2011;

•

We expect capital and investment expenditures to total between
    $3.125 billion and $4.125 billion in 2011. Of this
    total, a significant portion of Williams Partners’ expected
    expenditures of $1.58 billion to



$1.905 billion are considered nondiscretionary to meet
    legal, regulatory,

and/or

contractual requirements or to fund committed growth projects.
    Exploration & Production’s expected expenditures
    of $1.15 billion to $1.75 billion are considered
    primarily discretionary. See Results of Operations —
    Segments, Williams Partners and Exploration &
    Production for discussions describing the general nature of
    these expenditures.

Potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity
    and the planned capital and investment expenditures discussed
    above include:

•

Sustained reductions in energy commodity prices from the range
    of current expectations;

•

Lower than expected distributions, including incentive
    distribution rights, from WPZ. WPZ’s liquidity could also
    be impacted by a lack of adequate access to capital markets to
    fund its growth;

•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations from
    Exploration & Production and our other businesses.

Liquidity

Based on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and
    other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient
    liquidity to manage our businesses in 2011. Our internal and
    external sources of consolidated liquidity include cash
    generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents on
    hand, and our credit facilities. Additional sources of
    liquidity, if needed, include bank financings, proceeds from the
    issuance of long-term debt and equity securities, and proceeds
    from asset sales. These sources are available to us at the
    parent level and are expected to be available to certain of our
    subsidiaries, particularly equity and debt issuances from WPZ.
    WPZ is expected to be self-funding through its cash flows from
    operations, use of its credit facility, and its access to
    capital markets. Cash held by WPZ is available to us through
    distributions in accordance with the partnership agreement,
    which considers our level of ownership and incentive
    distribution rights. Our ability to raise funds in the capital
    markets will be impacted by our financial condition, interest
    rates, market conditions, and industry conditions.

At the parent-company level, we filed a shelf registration
    statement as a well-known, seasoned issuer in May 2009 that
    allows us to issue an unlimited amount of registered debt and

Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks that, so long as certain conditions
    are met, serves to reduce our use of cash and other credit
    facilities for margin requirements related to our hedging
    activities as well as lower transaction fees. In July 2010, the
    agreement term was extended from December 2013 to December 2015.
    The impairments of goodwill, natural gas producing properties
    and acquired unproved reserves recorded by our
    Exploration & Production segment in the third quarter
    of 2010 (see Notes 4 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements) did not impact our ability to utilize
    Exploration & Production’s credit agreement to
    facilitate hedging our future natural gas production.

Credit rating agencies perform independent analyses when
    assigning credit ratings. No assurance can be given that the
    credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment
    grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their current criteria
    for investment grade ratios. A downgrade of our credit rating
    might increase our future cost of borrowing and would require us
    to post additional collateral with third parties, negatively
    impacting our available liquidity. As of December 31, 2010,
    we estimate that a downgrade to a rating below investment grade
    for WMB or WPZ would require us to post up to $453 million
    or $53 million, respectively, in additional collateral with
    third parties.

    income tax liabilities in the table above. See Note 5 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of
    income taxes, including our unrecognized tax benefits.

Effects
    of Inflation

Our operations have benefited from relatively low inflation
    rates. Approximately 35 percent of our gross property,
    plant, and equipment is comprised of our interstate gas
    pipelines. These assets are subject to regulation, which limits
    recovery to historical cost. While amounts in excess of
    historical cost are not recoverable under current FERC
    practices, we anticipate being allowed to recover and earn a
    return based on increased actual cost incurred to replace
    existing assets. Cost-based regulation, along with competition
    and other market factors, may limit our ability to recover such
    increased costs. For the remainder of our business, operating
    costs are influenced to a greater extent by both competition for
    specialized services and specific price changes in crude oil and
    natural gas and related commodities than by changes in general
    inflation. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices are
    particularly sensitive to the Organization of the Petroleum
    Exporting Countries (OPEC) production levels

and/or

the
    market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in
    the near future, as well as general economic conditions.
    However, our exposure to certain of these price changes is
    reduced through the use of hedging instruments and the fee-based
    nature of certain of our services.

Environmental

We are a participant in certain environmental activities in
    various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations

and/or

remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently
    do not own (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements). We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated
    effort with other potentially responsible parties, the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other
    governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable
    along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities
    and solely responsible in others. Current estimates of the most
    likely costs of such activities are approximately
    $49 million, all of which are included in

accrued
    liabilities

and

other liabilities and deferred income

on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010. We
    will seek recovery of approximately $12 million of these
    accrued costs through future natural gas transmission rates. The
    remainder of these costs will be funded from operations. During
    2010, we paid approximately $8 million for cleanup

and/or

remediation and monitoring activities. We expect to pay
    approximately $11 million in 2011 for these activities.
    Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally
    based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of
    studies or our experience with other similar cleanup operations.
    At December 31, 2010, certain assessment studies were still
    in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield
    significantly different estimates of most likely costs.
    Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final
    amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these
    sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other
    governmental authorities, and other factors.

We are also subject to the Federal Clean Air Act (Act) and to
    the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (1990 Amendments),
    which added significantly to the existing requirements
    established by the Act. Pursuant to requirements of the 1990
    Amendments and EPA rules designed to mitigate the migration of
    ground-level ozone (NOx), we are planning installation of air
    pollution controls on existing sources at certain facilities in
    order to reduce NOx emissions. For many of these facilities, we
    are developing more cost effective and innovative compressor
    engine control designs.

In March 2008, the EPA promulgated a new, lower National Ambient
    Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone. Within two
    years, the EPA was expected to designate new

eight-hour

ozone non-attainment areas. However, in September 2009, the EPA
    announced it would reconsider the 2008 NAAQS for ground level
    ozone to ensure that the standards were clearly grounded in
    science and were protective of both public health and the
    environment. As a result, the EPA delayed designation of new

eight-hour

ozone non-attainment areas under the 2008 standards until the
    reconsideration is complete. In January 2010, the EPA proposed
    to further reduce the ground-level ozone NAAQS from the March
    2008 levels. The EPA currently anticipates finalization of the
    new ground-level ozone standard in the third quarter of 2011.
    Designation of new

eight-hour

ozone non-attainment areas



are expected to result in additional federal and state
    regulatory actions that will likely impact our operations and
    increase the cost of additions to

property, plant and
    equipment-net

on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We are
    unable at this time to estimate the cost of additions that may
    be required to meet this new regulation.

Additionally, in August 2010, the EPA promulgated National
    Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP)
    regulations that will impact our operations. The emission
    control additions required to comply with the NESHAP regulations
    are estimated to include costs in the range of $31 million
    to $39 million through 2013, the compliance date.

Furthermore, the EPA promulgated the Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
    Mandatory Reporting Rule on October 30, 2009, which
    requires facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more carbon
    dioxide
    (CO


)
    equivalent per year from stationary fossil fuel combustion
    sources to report GHG emissions to the EPA annually beginning
    March 31, 2011 for calendar year 2010. On November 30,
    2010, the EPA issued additional regulations that expand the
    scope of the Mandatory Reporting Rule to include fugitive and
    vented greenhouse gas emissions effective January 1, 2011.
    Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more
    CO


equivalent per year from stationary fossil-fuel combustion and
    fugitive/vented sources combined will be required to report GHG
    combustion and fugitive/vented emissions to the EPA annually
    beginning March 31, 2012, for calendar year 2011.
    Compliance with this reporting obligation is estimated to cost a
    total of $10 million to $14 million over the next four
    to five years.

In February 2010, the EPA promulgated a final rule establishing
    a new

one-hour

nitrogen dioxide
    (NO


)
    NAAQS. The effective date of the new
    NO


standard was April 12, 2010. This new standard is subject
    to numerous challenges in the federal court. We are unable at
    this time to estimate the cost of additions that may be required
    to meet this new regulation.

Our interstate natural gas pipelines consider prudently incurred
    environmental assessment and remediation costs and the costs
    associated with compliance with environmental standards to be
    recoverable through rates.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to
    our debt portfolio. The majority of our debt portfolio is
    comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of
    fluctuations in interest rates. Any borrowings under our credit
    facilities could be at a variable interest rate and could expose
    us to the risk of increasing interest rates. The maturity of our
    long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected
    lives of our operating assets.

The tables below provide information by maturity date about our
    interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009. Long-term debt in the tables represents principal
    cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average
    interest rates by expected maturity dates. The fair value of our
    publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative
    year-end traded bond market prices. Private debt is valued based
    on market rates and the prices of similar securities with
    similar terms and credit ratings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price
    of natural gas, NGL and crude, as well as other market factors,
    such as market volatility and energy commodity price
    correlations. We are exposed to these risks in connection with
    our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related
    contracts and our proprietary trading activities. We manage the
    risks associated with these market fluctuations using various
    derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. The fair
    value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors,
    including changes in energy commodity market prices, the
    liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts
    are transacted, and changes in interest rates. (See Note 15
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

We measure the risk in our portfolios using a

value-at-risk

methodology to estimate the potential

one-day

loss
    from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios. Value
    at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not
    necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that
    could be incurred from the portfolios. Our

value-at-risk

model uses a Monte Carlo method to simulate hypothetical
    movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result
    of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent
    probability that the

one-day

loss
    in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at
    risk. The simulation method uses historical correlations and



market forward prices and volatilities. In applying the

value-at-risk

methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical
    movements affect the positions or would cause any potential
    liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the
    portfolios in response to market conditions could affect market
    prices and could take longer than a

one-day

holding period to execute. While a

one-day

holding period has historically been the industry standard, a
    longer holding period could more accurately represent the true
    market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and
    liquidity constraints.

We segregate our derivative contracts into trading and
    nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. We
    calculate value at risk separately for these two categories.
    Contracts designated as normal purchases or sales and
    nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our
    estimation of value at risk.

Trading

Our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered
    into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity
    price-risk exposure. The fair value of our trading derivatives
    was a net asset of $2 million at December 31, 2010.
    The value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was
    less than $1 million at December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009.

Nontrading

Our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that
    hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from
    the following activities:

Segment

Commodity Price Risk Exposure

Williams Partners

• Natural gas purchases

• NGL sales

Exploration & Production

• Natural gas purchases and sales

Other

• NGL purchases

The fair value of our nontrading derivatives was a net asset of
    $282 million at December 31, 2010.

The value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading
    purposes was $24 million at December 31, 2010, and
    $34 million at December 31, 2009. During the year
    ended December 31, 2010, our value at risk for these
    contracts ranged from a high of $33 million to a low of
    $21 million. The decrease in value at risk primarily
    reflects the realization of certain derivative positions and the
    market price impact, partially offset by new derivative
    contracts.

Certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes
    are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Of the total fair value
    of nontrading derivatives, cash flow hedges had a net asset
    value of $266 million as of December 31, 2010. Though
    these contracts are included in our

value-at-risk

calculation, any changes in the fair value of the effective
    portion of these hedge contracts would generally not be
    reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects
    earnings.

Trading
    Policy

We have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk
    management activities. These policies cover authority and
    delegation thereof in addition to control requirements,
    authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations.

Value-at-risk

is limited in aggregate and calculated at a 95 percent
    confidence level.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Net assets of our consolidated foreign operations, whose
    functional currency is the local currency, are located primarily
    in Canada and approximate 8 percent and 6 percent of
    our net assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    These foreign operations do not have significant transactions or
    financial instruments denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currency. However, these investments do have the
    potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations
    in these local currencies arising from the process of
    translating the local functional currency into the
    U.S. dollar. As an example, a 20 percent change in the
    respective functional currencies against the U.S. dollar
    would have changed

stockholders’ equity

by
    approximately $117 million at December 31, 2010.

    Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT’S
    ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f) under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our internal controls over
    financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance
    to our management and board of directors regarding the
    preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. Our internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
    made only in accordance with authorization of our management and
    board of directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a
    material effect on our financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations including the possibility of human error
    and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even
    those systems determined to be effective can provide only
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our
    assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial
    reporting, as stated in their report which is included in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited The Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    The Williams Companies, Inc.’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, The Williams Companies, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of The Williams Companies, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2010 of The Williams Companies, Inc. and our report dated
    February 24, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    The Williams Companies, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also
    included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at
    Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits. The 2010 financial
    statements of Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C.
    (“Gulfstream”) (a limited liability corporation in
    which the Company has a 50% interest), have been audited by
    other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our
    opinion on the 2010 consolidated financial statements, insofar
    as it relates to the amounts included for Gulfstream, is based
    solely on the report of the other auditors. In the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company’s investment in
    Gulfstream is stated at $378 million at December 31,
    2010 and the Company’s equity earnings in the net income of
    Gulfstream is stated at $66 million for the year then ended.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the
    report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other
    auditors, the financial statements referred to above present
    fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
    position of The Williams Companies, Inc. at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations
    and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company
    changed its reserve estimates and related disclosures as a
    result of adopting new oil and gas reserve estimation and
    disclosure requirements.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The
    Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Members of Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C.

Houston, Texas

We have audited the balance sheet of Gulfstream Natural Gas
    System, L.L.C., (the “Company”), as of
    December 31, 2010, and the related statements of
    operations, cash flows, and members’ equity and
    comprehensive income for the period ended December 31,
    2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the auditing standards
    of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
    States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
    audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
    required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
    its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit
    included consideration of internal control over financial
    reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
    appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
    expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
    express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
    used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
    evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Gulfstream Natural
    Gas System, L.L.C. as of December 31, 2010, and the results
    of its operations and its cash flows for the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Description
    of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Operations of our company are located principally in the United
    States and are organized into the following reporting segments:
    Williams Partners, Exploration & Production, and Other.

Williams Partners consists of our consolidated master limited
    partnership, Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ) and includes the gas
    pipeline and midstream businesses that were contributed as part
    of our first quarter 2010 restructuring. The contributed gas
    pipeline businesses include 100 percent of Transcontinental
    Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco), 65 percent of
    Northwest Pipeline GP (Northwest Pipeline), and
    24.5 percent of Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C.
    (Gulfstream). The remaining 35 percent of Northwest
    Pipeline is directly owned by WPZ following the third quarter
    2010 merger of WPZ and Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. (WMZ).
    WPZ’s midstream operations are composed of significant,
    large-scale operations in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast
    regions, operations in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale
    region, and various equity investments in domestic processing
    and fractionation assets. WPZ’s midstream assets also
    include substantial operations and investments in the Four
    Corners and Gulf Coast regions, as well as a NGLs fractionator
    and storage facilities near Conway, Kansas.

Exploration & Production includes the natural gas
    development, production and gas management activities primarily
    in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States, natural gas development activities in the northeastern
    portion of the United States, oil and natural gas interests in
    South America, and more recently, oil development activities in
    the northern United States. The gas management activities
    include procuring fuel and shrink gas for our midstream
    businesses and providing marketing to third parties, such as
    producers. Additionally, gas management activities include
    managing various natural gas related contracts such as
    transportation, storage, and related hedges.

Other includes other business activities that are not operating
    segments, primarily our Canadian midstream and domestic olefins
    operations, a 25.5 percent interest in Gulfstream, as well
    as corporate operations.

Basis
    of Presentation

During fourth-quarter 2010, we contributed a business
    represented by certain gathering and processing assets in
    Colorado’s Piceance basin to WPZ. The transaction has been
    accounted for as a combination of entities under common control
    whereby the assets and liabilities sold were recorded by WPZ at
    their historical amounts. The operations of this business and
    the related assets and liabilities were previously reported
    through our Exploration & Production segment, however
    they are now reported in our Williams Partners segment. Prior
    period segment disclosures have been adjusted for this
    transaction.

Master
    limited partnerships

At December 31, 2010, we own approximately 75 percent
    of the interests in WPZ, including the interests of the general
    partner, which is wholly owned by us, and incentive distribution
    rights. At December 31, 2009, we owned approximately
    24 percent of WPZ. Changes in our ownership of WPZ
    occurring during the past year include:

•

In conjunction with our first quarter 2010 restructuring, we
    ultimately received 203,000,000 common units from WPZ. Following
    this transaction, we owned approximately 84 percent of WPZ.

•

On August 31, 2010, WMZ unitholders approved the merger
    between WMZ and WPZ. As a result of the merger, effective
    September 1, 2010, WMZ unitholders, other than its general
    partner, received 0.7584 WPZ common units for each WMZ common
    unit they owned at the effective time of the merger, for a total
    issuance of 13,580,485 common units. Upon completing this
    merger, WMZ is wholly owned by WPZ and is no longer publicly
    traded.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

On September 28, 2010, WPZ completed an equity issuance of
    common units resulting in proceeds of $380 million, net of
    the underwriters’ discount and fees.

•

On October 8, 2010, WPZ sold additional common units to the
    underwriters upon the underwriters’ exercise of their
    option to purchase additional common units pursuant to
    WPZ’s common unit offering in September 2010. The offering
    resulted in proceeds of $57 million, net of the
    underwriters’ discount and fees.

•

On December 17, 2010, WPZ completed an equity issuance of
    common units resulting in proceeds of approximately
    $369 million, net of the underwriters’ discount and
    fees.

These transactions resulted in changes in ownership between us
    and the noncontrolling interest that have been accounted for as
    equity transactions, resulting in an aggregate $77 million
    increase in capital in excess of par and a corresponding
    decrease in noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries.

WPZ is self funding and maintains separate lines of bank credit
    and cash management accounts. Cash distributions from WPZ to us,
    including any associated with our incentive distribution rights,
    occur through the normal partnership distributions from WPZ to
    all partners.

Discontinued
    operations

The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes
    reflect the results of operations and financial position of
    certain of our Venezuela operations and other former businesses
    as discontinued operations. (See Note 2).

Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing
    operations.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    our corporate parent and our majority-owned or controlled
    subsidiaries and investments. We apply the equity method of
    accounting for investments in unconsolidated companies in which
    we and our subsidiaries own 20 to 50 percent of the voting
    interest, otherwise exercise significant influence over
    operating and financial policies of the company, or where
    majority ownership does not provide us with control due to
    significant participatory rights of other owners.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Significant estimates and assumptions include:

•

Impairment assessments of investments, long-lived assets and
    goodwill;

•

Litigation-related contingencies;

•

Valuations of derivatives;

•

Hedge accounting correlations and probability;

•

Environmental remediation obligations;

•

Realization of deferred income tax assets;



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Valuation of Exploration & Production’s reserves;

•

Asset retirement obligations;

•

Pension and postretirement valuation variables.

These estimates are discussed further throughout these notes.

Regulatory
    accounting

Transco and Northwest Pipeline are regulated by the Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Their rates established by
    the FERC are designed to recover the costs of providing the
    regulated services, and their competitive environment makes it
    probable that such rates can be charged and collected.
    Therefore, our management has determined that it is appropriate
    to account for and report regulatory assets and liabilities
    related to these operations consistent with the economic effect
    of the way in which their rates are established. Accounting for
    these businesses that are regulated can differ from the
    accounting requirements for non-regulated businesses. These
    differences are discussed further throughout these notes.

Cash and
    cash equivalents

Our

cash and cash equivalents

balance includes amounts
    primarily invested in funds with high-quality, short-term
    securities and instruments that are issued or guaranteed by the
    U.S. government. These have maturity dates of three months
    or less when acquired.

Accounts
    receivable

Accounts receivable

are carried on a gross basis, with no
    discounting, less the allowance for doubtful accounts. We
    estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on existing
    economic conditions, the financial conditions of the customers
    and the amount and age of past due accounts. Receivables are
    considered past due if full payment is not received by the
    contractual due date. Interest income related to past due
    accounts receivable is generally recognized at the time full
    payment is received or collectability is assured. Past due
    accounts are generally written off against the allowance for
    doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been
    exhausted.

Inventory
    valuation

All

inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or
    market. The cost of inventories is primarily determined using
    the average-cost method. We determine the cost of certain
    natural gas inventories held by Transco using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) cost method. LIFO inventory at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 is $9 million and
    $7 million, respectively.

Property,
    plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment

is recorded at cost. We
    base the carrying value of these assets on estimates,
    assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized costs, useful
    lives and salvage values.

As regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco provide
    for depreciation using the straight-line method at
    FERC-prescribed rates. See Note 9 for depreciation rates
    used for major regulated gas plant facilities.

Depreciation for nonregulated entities is provided primarily on
    the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, except as
    noted below for oil and gas exploration and production
    activities. See Note 9 for the estimated useful lives
    associated with our nonregulated assets.

Gains or losses from the ordinary sale or retirement of
    property, plant, and equipment for regulated pipelines are
    credited or charged to accumulated depreciation; other gains or
    losses are recorded in

other (income) expense — net

included in

operating income

.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Ordinary maintenance and repair costs are generally expensed as
    incurred. Costs of major renewals and replacements are
    capitalized as

property, plant, and equipment —
    net

.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted
    for under the successful efforts method. Costs incurred in
    connection with the drilling and equipping of exploratory wells,
    as applicable, are capitalized as incurred. If proved reserves
    are not found, such costs are charged to expense. Other
    exploration costs, including lease rentals, are expensed as
    incurred. All costs related to development wells, including
    related production equipment and lease acquisition costs, are
    capitalized when incurred.

Depreciation, depletion and
    amortization

is provided under the

units-of-production

method on a field basis.

We record an asset and a liability upon incurrence equal to the
    present value of each expected future asset retirement
    obligation (ARO). The ARO asset is depreciated in a manner
    consistent with the depreciation of the underlying physical
    asset. We measure changes in the liability due to passage of
    time by applying an interest method of allocation. This amount
    is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the
    liability and as a corresponding accretion expense included in

other (income) expense — net

included in

operating income

, except for regulated entities, for
    which the liability is offset by a regulatory asset as
    management expects to recover amounts in future rates. The
    regulatory asset is amortized commensurate with our collection
    of those costs in rates.

Measurements of AROs include, as a component of future expected
    costs, an estimate of the price that a third party would demand,
    and could expect to receive, for bearing the uncertainties
    inherent in the obligations, sometimes referred to as a
    market-risk premium.

Goodwill

Goodwill

represents the excess of cost over fair value of
    the assets of businesses acquired. It is evaluated at least
    annually for impairment by first comparing our management’s
    estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
    value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the
    reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a computation of the
    implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with its related
    carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
    goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
    impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess.

As a result of significant declines in forward natural gas
    prices during the third quarter of 2010, we performed an interim
    impairment assessment of our goodwill. As a result of that
    assessment, we recorded an impairment of goodwill of
    approximately $1 billion. See Note 4.

Cash
    flows from revolving credit facilities

Proceeds and payments related to borrowings under our credit
    facilities are reflected in the

financing activities

of
    the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis.

Treasury
    stock

Treasury stock

purchases are accounted for under the cost
    method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded
    as treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance
    of shares are credited or charged to

capital in excess of par
    value

using the average-cost method.

Derivative
    instruments and hedging activities

We utilize derivatives to manage our commodity price risk. These
    instruments consist primarily of futures contracts, swap
    agreements, option contracts, and forward contracts involving
    short- and long-term purchases and sales of a physical energy
    commodity.

We report the fair value of derivatives, except for those for
    which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has been
    elected, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in

derivative
    assets

and

derivative liabilities

as



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

either current or noncurrent. We determine the current and
    noncurrent classification based on the timing of expected future
    cash flows of individual trades. We report these amounts on a
    gross basis. Additionally, we report cash collateral receivables
    and payables with our counterparties on a gross basis.

The accounting for the changes in fair value of a commodity
    derivative can be summarized as follows:

Derivative Treatment

Accounting Method

Normal purchases and normal sales exception

Accrual accounting

Designated in a qualifying hedging relationship

Hedge accounting

All other derivatives

Mark-to-market accounting

We may elect the normal purchases and normal sales exception for
    certain short- and long-term purchases and sales of a physical
    energy commodity. Under accrual accounting, any change in the
    fair value of these derivatives is not reflected on the balance
    sheet after the initial election of the exception.

We have also designated a hedging relationship for certain
    commodity derivatives. For a derivative to qualify for
    designation in a hedging relationship, it must meet specific
    criteria and we must maintain appropriate documentation. We
    establish hedging relationships pursuant to our risk management
    policies. We evaluate the hedging relationships at the inception
    of the hedge and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the
    hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly
    effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash
    flows attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. We also
    regularly assess whether the hedged forecasted transaction is
    probable of occurring. If a derivative ceases to be or is no
    longer expected to be highly effective, or if we believe the
    likelihood of occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction is
    no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued
    prospectively, and future changes in the fair value of the
    derivative are recognized currently in

revenues

or

costs and operating expenses

dependent upon the
    underlying hedge transaction.

For commodity derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is reported in

accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

(AOCI) and reclassified into earnings in the period in which
    the hedged item affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of the
    derivative’s change in fair value is recognized currently
    in

revenues

or

costs and operating expenses

. Gains
    or losses deferred in AOCI associated with terminated
    derivatives, derivatives that cease to be highly effective
    hedges, derivatives for which the forecasted transaction is
    reasonably possible but no longer probable of occurring, and
    cash flow hedges that have been otherwise discontinued remain in
    AOCI until the hedged item affects earnings. If it becomes
    probable that the forecasted transaction designated as the
    hedged item in a cash flow hedge will not occur, any gain or
    loss deferred in AOCI is recognized in

revenues

or

costs and operating expenses

at that time. The change in
    likelihood is a judgmental decision that includes qualitative
    assessments made by management.

For commodity derivatives that are not designated in a hedging
    relationship, and for which we have not elected the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception, we report changes in fair
    value currently in

revenues

or

costs and operating
    expenses

dependent upon the underlying hedge transaction.

Certain gains and losses on derivative instruments included in
    the Consolidated Statement of Operations are netted together to
    a single net gain or loss, while other gains and losses are
    reported on a gross basis. Gains and losses recorded on a net
    basis include:

•

Unrealized gains and losses on all derivatives that are not
    designated as hedges and for which we have not elected the
    normal purchases and normal sales exception;

•

The ineffective portion of unrealized gains and losses on
    derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges;

•

Realized gains and losses on all derivatives that settle
    financially other than natural gas derivatives for NGL
    processing activities;

•

Realized gains and losses on derivatives held for trading
    purposes;



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Realized gains and losses on derivatives entered into as a
    pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement.

Realized gains and losses on derivatives that require physical
    delivery, as well as natural gas derivatives for NGL processing
    activities and which are not held for trading purposes nor were
    entered into as a pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement, are
    recorded on a gross basis. In reaching our conclusions on this
    presentation, we considered whether we act as principal in the
    transaction; whether we have the risks and rewards of ownership,
    including credit risk; and whether we have latitude in
    establishing prices.

Revenues

Revenues from our gas pipeline businesses are primarily from
    services pursuant to long-term firm transportation and storage
    agreements. These agreements provide for a reservation charge
    based on the volume of contracted capacity and a commodity
    charge based on the volume of gas delivered, both at rates
    specified in our FERC tariffs. We recognize revenues for
    reservation charges ratably over the contract period regardless
    of the volume of natural gas that is transported or stored.
    Revenues for commodity charges, from both firm and interruptible
    transportation services, and storage injection and withdrawal
    services, are recognized when natural gas is delivered at the
    agreed upon delivery point or when natural gas is injected or
    withdrawn from the storage facility.

In the course of providing transportation services to customers,
    we may receive different quantities of gas from shippers than
    the quantities delivered on behalf of those shippers. The
    resulting imbalances are primarily settled through the purchase
    and sale of gas with our customers under terms provided for in
    our FERC tariffs. Revenue is recognized from the sale of gas
    upon settlement of the transportation and exchange imbalances.

As a result of the ratemaking process, certain revenues
    collected by us may be subject to refunds upon the issuance of
    final orders by the FERC in pending rate proceedings. We record
    estimates of rate refund liabilities considering our and other
    third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and other
    risks.

Revenues from our midstream operations include those derived
    from natural gas gathering and processing services and are
    performed under volumetric-based fee contracts, keep-whole
    agreements and

percent-of-liquids

arrangements. Revenues under volumetric-based fee contracts are
    recorded when services have been performed. Under keep-whole and

percent-of-liquids

processing contracts, we retain the rights to all or a portion
    of the NGLs extracted from the producers’ natural gas
    stream and recognize revenues when the extracted NGLs are sold
    and delivered.

Oil gathering and transportation revenues and offshore
    production handling fees of our midstream operations are
    recognized when the services have been performed. Certain
    offshore production handling contracts contain fixed payment
    terms that result in the deferral of revenues until such
    services have been performed.

We market NGLs that we purchase from our producer customers.
    Revenues from marketing NGLs are recognized when the products
    have been sold and delivered.

Storage revenues under prepaid contracted storage capacity
    contracts are recognized evenly over the life of the contract as
    services are provided.

Revenues for sales of natural gas are recognized when the
    product is sold and delivered. Revenues from the domestic
    production of natural gas in properties for which
    Exploration & Production has an interest with other
    producers are recognized based on the actual volumes sold during
    the period. Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement
    volumes, based on Exploration & Production’s net
    working interest, that are determined to be nonrecoverable
    through remaining production are recognized as accounts
    receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. Cumulative
    differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are not
    significant.

We have NGLs and olefins extraction operations where we retain
    certain products extracted from the producers’ off-gas
    stream and we recognize revenues when the extracted products are
    sold and delivered to



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

our purchasers. We also produce olefins from purchased
    feed-stock, and we recognize revenues when the olefins are sold
    and delivered.

Impairment
    of long-lived assets and investments

We evaluate the long-lived assets of identifiable business
    activities for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate, in our management’s judgment, that
    the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Except
    for proved and unproved properties discussed below, when an
    indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our
    management’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
    attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets
    to determine whether an impairment has occurred and we apply a
    probability-weighted approach to consider the likelihood of
    different cash flow assumptions and possible outcomes including
    selling in the near term or holding for the remaining estimated
    useful life. If an impairment of the carrying value has
    occurred, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized
    in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the
    assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying
    value exceeds the estimated fair value.

For assets identified to be disposed of in the future and
    considered held for sale, we compare the carrying value to the
    estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if
    recognition of an impairment is required. Until the assets are
    disposed of, the estimated fair value, which includes estimated
    cash flows from operations until the assumed date of sale, is
    recalculated when related events or circumstances change.

Proved properties, including developed and undeveloped, are
    assessed for impairment using estimated future undiscounted cash
    flows on a field basis. If the undiscounted cash flows are less
    than the carrying value of the assets, then a subsequent
    analysis to estimate fair value is performed using discounted
    cash flows. Estimating future cash flows involves the use of
    complex judgments such as estimation of the oil and gas reserve
    quantities, risk associated with the different categories of oil
    and gas reserves, timing of development and production, expected
    future commodity prices, capital expenditures, and production
    costs.

Unproved properties include lease acquisition costs and costs of
    acquired unproved reserves. Individually significant lease
    acquisition costs are assessed annually, or as conditions
    warrant, for impairment considering our future drilling plans,
    the remaining lease term and recent drilling results. Lease
    acquisition costs that are not individually significant are
    aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be
    nonproductive is amortized over the average holding period. The
    estimate of what could be nonproductive is based on our
    historical experience or other information, including current
    drilling plans and existing geological data. A majority of the
    costs of acquired unproved reserves are associated with areas to
    which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed.
    Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas
    is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive
    formation tests, but may be confirmed by our continuing
    development program. Ultimate recovery of potentially
    recoverable reserves in areas with established production
    generally has greater probability than in areas with limited or
    no prior drilling activity. Costs of acquired unproved reserves
    are assessed annually, or as conditions warrant, for impairment
    using estimated future discounted cash flows on a field basis
    and considering our future drilling plans. If the unproved
    properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate
    related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties.

We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate, in our management’s
    judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have
    experienced an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. When evidence of loss in value has occurred,
    we compare our estimate of fair value of the investment to the
    carrying value of the investment to determine whether an
    impairment has occurred. If the estimated fair value is less
    than the carrying value and we consider the decline in value to
    be

other-than-temporary,

the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is
    recognized in the consolidated financial statements as an
    impairment charge.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
    estimate of undiscounted future cash flows and an asset’s
    fair value. Additionally, judgment is used to determine the
    probability of sale with respect to assets considered for
    disposal.

Capitalization
    of interest

We capitalize interest during construction on major projects
    with construction periods of at least three months and a total
    project cost in excess of $1 million. Interest is
    capitalized on borrowed funds and, where regulation by the FERC
    exists, on internally generated funds as a component of

other
    income (expense) — net

. The rates used by
    regulated companies are calculated in accordance with FERC
    rules. Rates used by nonregulated companies are based on the
    average interest rate on debt.

Employee
    stock-based awards

Stock options are valued at the date of award, which does not
    precede the approval date, and compensation cost is recognized
    on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
    requisite service period. The purchase price per share for stock
    options may not be less than the market price of the underlying
    stock on the date of grant. Stock options generally become
    exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and
    can be subject to accelerated vesting if certain future stock
    prices or specific financial performance targets are achieved.
    Stock options generally expire ten years after the grant.

Restricted stock units are generally valued at market value on
    the grant date and generally vest over three years. Restricted
    stock unit compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is
    generally recognized over the vesting period on a straight-line
    basis.

Income
    taxes

We include the operations of our subsidiaries in our
    consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are computed
    using the liability method and are provided on all temporary
    differences between the financial basis and the tax basis of our
    assets and liabilities. Our management’s judgment and
    income tax assumptions are used to determine the levels, if any,
    of valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets.

Earnings
    (loss) per common share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share

is based on the
    sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
    and vested restricted stock units.

Diluted earnings (loss)
    per common share

includes any dilutive effect of stock
    options, nonvested restricted stock units and, for applicable
    periods presented, convertible debt, unless otherwise noted.

Foreign
    currency translation

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries use the Canadian dollar as
    their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such
    foreign subsidiaries are translated at the spot rate in effect
    at the applicable reporting date, and the combined statements of
    operations are translated into the U.S. dollar at the
    average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period.
    The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is recorded as a
    separate component of AOCI.

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
    currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such
    transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result
    in transaction gains and losses which are reflected in the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Income (loss) from investments

in 2009 reflects a
    $75 million impairment charge related to an

other-than-temporary

loss in value associated with our Venezuelan investment in
    Accroven SRL (Accroven). Accroven owns and operates gas
    processing facilities and a NGL fractionation plant for the
    exclusive benefit of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).
    The deteriorating circumstances in the first quarter of 2009 for
    our Venezuelan operations caused us to review our investment in
    Accroven. We utilized a probability-weighted discounted cash
    flow analysis, which included an after-tax discount rate of
    20 percent to reflect the risk associated with operating in
    Venezuela. Accroven was not part of the operations that were
    expropriated by the Venezuelan government in May 2009.

In June 2010, we sold our 50 percent interest in Accroven
    to the state-owned oil company, PDVSA for $107 million. Of
    this amount, $13 million was received in cash at closing
    and another $30 million was received in August 2010. The
    remainder is due in six quarterly payments beginning
    October 31, 2010. The first quarterly payment of
    $11 million was received in January 2011 and will be
    recognized as income in 2011. We will continue to recognize the
    resulting gain as cash is received. Accroven was not part of our
    operations that were expropriated by the Venezuelan government
    in May 2009.

Impairment of cost-based investments

in 2009 includes an
    $11 million impairment related to our 4 percent
    interest in a Venezuelan corporation that owns and operates oil
    and gas activities. This investment resulted from our previous
    10 percent direct working interest in a concession that was
    converted to a reduced interest in a mixed company at the
    direction of the Venezuelan government in 2006. Considering our
    evaluation of the deteriorating financial condition of this
    corporation, we recorded an

other-than-temporary

decline in value of our remaining investment balance.

The unfavorable change in

interest income and other

in
    2009 is primarily due to lower average interest rates which
    continued in 2010.

Impairments
    of goodwill and certain Exploration & Production

As a result of significant declines in forward natural gas
    prices during the third quarter of 2010, we performed an interim
    impairment assessment of our capitalized costs related to
    goodwill and domestic properties at Exploration &
    Production. As a result of these assessments,
    Exploration & Production recorded an impairment of

    certain acquired unproved reserves in the Piceance Highlands
    acquired in 2008 of $175 million.

Based on a comparison of the estimated fair value to the
    carrying value, Exploration & Production recorded a
    $15 million impairment in 2009 related to costs of acquired
    unproved reserves resulting from a 2008 acquisition in the
    Fort Worth basin. Additionally, Exploration &
    Production recorded impairment charges of $5 million and
    $143 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to
    properties in the Arkoma basin.

Our impairment analyses included assessments of undiscounted
    (except for the unproved reserves) and discounted future cash
    flows, which considered information obtained from drilling,
    other activities, and year-end natural gas reserve quantities.
    See Note 14 for a further discussion of the impairments.

Additional
    Items

We completed a strategic restructuring transaction in 2010 that
    involved significant debt issuances, retirements and amendments
    (see Note 11). We incurred significant costs related to
    these transactions, as follows:

•

$606 million of early debt retirement costs consisting
    primarily of cash premiums;

•

$45 million of other transaction costs reflected in

general corporate expenses,

State income taxes (net of federal benefit) were reduced by
    $65 million in 2010 and $46 million in 2008 due to
    reductions in our estimate of the effective deferred state rate,
    including state income tax carryovers, reflective of a change in
    the mix of jurisdictional attribution of taxable income.

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes

includes $173 million of foreign income,
    $36 million of foreign loss, and $139 million of
    foreign income in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

During the course of audits of our business by domestic and
    foreign tax authorities, we frequently face challenges regarding
    the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions
    regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation
    of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the
    liability associated with our various filing positions, we apply
    the two step process of recognition and measurement. In
    association with this liability, we record an estimate of
    related interest and tax exposure as a component of our tax
    provision. The impact of this accrual is included within

other-net

    statutory rate.

The valuation allowance at December 31, 2010 and 2009

    loss and credit carryovers to an amount that will more likely
    than not be realized. These amounts are presented in the table
    above before any federal benefit.

As a result of the plan approved by our Board of Directors to
    pursue separation of the company into two standalone publicly
    traded corporations (see Note 19), we provided
    $66 million of deferred taxes in 2010 on undistributed
    earnings of certain foreign operations that we no longer
    consider permanently reinvested. As of December 31, 2010,
    we still consider $277 million of undistributed earnings of
    other consolidated foreign subsidiaries to be permanently
    reinvested and have not provided deferred income taxes on that
    amount.

Cash payments for income taxes (net of refunds and including
    discontinued operations) were $40 million,
    $14 million, and $155 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    $91 million of unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized,
    approximately $74 million, net of federal tax expense,
    would be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense.

respectively. Approximately $104 million and
    $93 million of interest and penalties primarily relating to
    uncertain tax positions have been accrued as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    examination of our consolidated U.S. income tax return for
    2008 is in process. During the first quarter of 2011, we
    finalized a settlement for 1997 through 2007 on certain
    contested matters with the IRS Appeals Division which we
    anticipate will result in a net reduction to our 2011 provision
    for income taxes of approximately $90 million to
    $100 million. This reduction is primarily driven by a
    deferred tax asset created as a result of our settlement. We
    anticipate making approximately $160 million to
    $170 million of cash payments to the IRS and various states
    related to this settlement in 2011. During the first quarter of
    2011, we expect this settlement to reduce the balance of our
    unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $40 million. The
    statute of limitations for most states expires one year after
    expiration of the IRS statute.

Generally, tax returns for our Venezuelan, Argentine and
    Canadian entities are open to audit from 2003 through 2010.
    Certain Canadian entities are currently under examination. We
    believe there is a high degree of probability of an adjustment
    related to an international matter that could result in a
    decrease of approximately $17 million in our unrecognized
    tax benefits during the next twelve months.

During 2009, we issued shares of our common stock in exchange

For 2010, 3.2 million weighted-average nonvested restricted

Employee
    Benefit Plans

We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in which
    all eligible employees participate. Currently, eligible
    employees earn benefits primarily based on a cash balance
    formula. Various other formulas, as defined in the plan
    documents, are utilized to calculate the retirement benefits for
    plan participants not covered by the cash balance formula. At
    the time of retirement, participants may elect, to the extent
    they are eligible for the various options, to receive annuity
    payments, a lump sum payment, or a combination of a lump sum and
    annuity payments. In addition to our pension plans, we currently
    provide subsidized retiree medical and life insurance benefits
    (other postretirement benefits) to certain eligible
    participants. Generally, employees hired after December 31,
    1991, are not eligible for the subsidized retiree medical
    benefits, except for participants that were employees or
    retirees of Transco Energy Company on December 31, 1995,
    and other miscellaneous defined participant groups. Certain of
    these other postretirement benefit plans, particularly the
    subsidized retiree medical benefit plans, provide for retiree
    contributions and contain other cost-sharing features such as
    deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance. The accounting for
    these plans anticipates future cost-sharing that is consistent
    with our expressed intent to increase the retiree contribution
    level generally in line with health care cost increases.

The pension plans’ benefit obligation

actuarial loss

of $108 million in 2010 and $48 million in 2009 is
    primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates
    utilized to calculate the benefit obligation. The 2010 benefit
    obligation

actuarial loss

of $30 million for our
    other postretirement benefit plans is primarily due to the
    impact of decreases in the discount rates utilized to calculate
    the benefit obligation and changes to medical claims experience.
    The impact of the provisions of the federal healthcare reform
    legislation has been included in the December 31, 2010
    other postretirement benefit plans’ obligation and is not
    significant. The other postretirement benefits

plan
    amendment

of $18 million in 2009 is due to an increase
    in the retirees’ cost-sharing percentage within our
    subsidized retiree medical benefit plans.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of our pension plans had
    a projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit
    obligation in excess of plan assets.

The determination of

net periodic benefit expense

allows
    for the delayed recognition of gains and losses caused by
    differences between actual and assumed outcomes for items such
    as estimated return on plan assets, or caused by changes in
    assumptions for items such as discount rates or estimated future
    compensation levels. The

net actuarial loss

presented in
    the following table and recorded in

accumulated other
    comprehensive loss

and

net regulatory assets

represents the cumulative net deferred loss from these types
    of differences or changes which have not yet been recognized in
    the Consolidated Statement of Income. A portion of the

net
    actuarial loss

is amortized over the participants’
    average remaining future years of service, which is
    approximately 13 years for our pension plans and
    approximately 11 years for our other postretirement benefit
    plans.

The discount rates for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans were determined separately based on an approach
    specific to our plans. The year-end discount rates were
    determined considering a yield curve comprised of high-quality
    corporate bonds published by a large securities firm and the
    timing of the expected benefit cash flows of each plan.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were
    determined by combining a review of the historical returns
    realized within the portfolio, the investment strategy included
    in the plans’ Investment Policy Statement, and capital
    market projections for the asset classes in which the portfolio
    is invested and the target weightings of each asset class.

The expected return on plan assets component of

net periodic
    benefit expense

is calculated using the market-related value
    of plan assets. For assets held in our pension plans, the
    market-related value of plan assets is equal to the fair value
    of plan assets adjusted to reflect amortization of gains or
    losses associated with the difference between the expected
    return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets over
    a five-year period. Additionally, the market-related value of
    plan assets may be no more than 110 percent or less than
    90 percent of the fair value of plan assets at the
    beginning of the year. The market-related value of plan assets
    for our other postretirement benefit plans is equal to the
    unadjusted fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the
    year.

The mortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for
    our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are the best
    estimate of expected mortality rates for the participants in
    these plans. The selected mortality

tables are among the most recent tables available and mortality
    improvements are projected to the measurement date.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for 2011 is
    7.0 percent, increases slightly in 2012 and 2013, and then
    decreases to 5.0 percent by 2021. The health care cost
    trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts
    reported. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care
    cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Plan
    Assets

The investment policy for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans provides for an investment strategy in accordance
    with ERISA, which governs the investment of the assets in a
    diversified portfolio. The plans follow a policy of diversifying
    the investments across various asset classes and investment
    managers. Additionally, the investment returns on approximately
    40 percent of the other postretirement benefit plan assets
    are subject to income tax; therefore, certain investments are
    managed in a tax efficient manner.

During 2010, the pension plans’ target asset allocation
    ranges were adjusted resulting in a slightly larger allocation
    to fixed income securities. The updated pension plans’
    target asset allocation range at December 31, 2010 was
    54 percent to 66 percent equity securities, which
    includes commingled investment funds, and 36 percent to
    44 percent fixed income securities and cash management
    funds. Within equity securities, the target range for
    U.S. equity securities is 37 percent to
    45 percent and international equity securities is
    17 percent to 21 percent. The asset allocation
    continues to be weighted toward equity securities since the
    obligations of the pension and other postretirement benefit
    plans are long-term in nature and historically equity securities
    have outperformed other asset classes over long periods of time.
    The rebalancing to the higher fixed income securities asset
    allocation is expected to occur during 2011.

Equity security investments are restricted to high-quality,
    readily marketable securities that are actively traded on the
    major U.S. and foreign national exchanges. Investment in
    Williams’ securities or an entity in which Williams has a
    majority ownership is prohibited in the pension plans except
    where these securities may be owned in a commingled investment
    fund in which the plans’ trusts invest. No more than
    5 percent of the total stock portfolio valued at market may
    be invested in the common stock of any one corporation.

The following securities and transactions are not authorized:
    unregistered securities, commodities or commodity contracts,
    short sales or margin transactions, or other leveraging
    strategies. Investment strategies using the direct holding of
    options or futures require approval and, historically, have not
    been used; however, these instruments may be used in commingled
    investment funds. Additionally, real estate equity and natural
    resource property investments are generally restricted.

Fixed income securities are restricted to high-quality,
    marketable securities that may include, but are not necessarily
    limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government
    guaranteed and nonguaranteed mortgage-backed securities,
    government and municipal bonds, and investment grade corporate
    securities. The overall rating of the fixed income security
    assets is generally required to be at least “A,”
    according to the Moody’s or Standard &
    Poor’s rating systems. No more than 5 percent of the
    total portfolio may be invested in the fixed income securities
    of any one issuer with the exception of bond index funds and
    U.S. government guaranteed and agency securities.

During 2010, nine active investment managers and one passive
    investment manager managed substantially all of the pension
    plans’ funds and five active investment managers managed
    the other postretirement benefit plans’ funds. Each of the
    managers had responsibility for managing a specific portion of
    these assets and each investment manager was responsible for
    2 percent to 17 percent of the assets.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets
    are held primarily in equity securities, including commingled
    investment funds invested in equity securities, and fixed income
    securities. Within the plans’ investment securities, there
    are no significant concentrations of risk because of the
    diversity of the types of investments, diversity of the various
    industries, and the diversity of the fund managers and
    investment strategies. Generally, the investments held in the
    plans are publicly traded, therefore, minimizing liquidity risk
    in the portfolio.

The pension and other postretirement benefit plans participate
    in securities lending programs under which securities are loaned
    to selected securities brokerage firms. The title of the
    securities is transferred to the borrower, but the plans are
    entitled to all distributions made by the issuer of the
    securities during the term of the loan and retain the right to
    redeem the securities on short notice. All loans require
    collateralization by U.S. government securities, cash, or
    letters of credit that equal at least 102 percent of the
    fair value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. There
    are limitations on the aggregate fair value of securities that
    may be loaned to any one broker and to all brokers as a group.
    The collateral is invested in repurchase agreements,
    asset-backed securities, bank notes, corporate floating rate
    notes, and certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2010,
    the fair values of the loaned securities are $116 million
    for the pension plans and $17 million for the other
    postretirement benefit plans and are included in the following
    tables. At December 31, 2010, the fair values of securities
    held as collateral, and the obligation to return the collateral,
    are $120 million for the pension plans and $17 million
    for the other postretirement benefit plans and are not included
    in the following tables. At December 31, 2009, the fair
    values of the loaned securities are $63 million for the
    pension plans and $9 million for the other postretirement
    benefit plans and are included in the following tables. At
    December 31, 2009, the fair values of securities held as
    collateral, and the obligation to return the collateral, are
    $66 million for the pension plans and $9 million for
    the other postretirement benefit plans and are not included in
    the following tables. The pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans are exiting the securities lending programs under
    a plan designed to be orderly and minimize potential losses. The
    exit from the securities lending programs is expected to be
    completed during 2011 and no significant losses are expected to
    be realized.

The asset’s fair value measurement level within the fair
    value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that
    is significant to the fair value measurement.

Shares of the cash management funds are valued at fair value
    based on published market prices as of the close of business on
    the last business day of the year, which represents the net
    asset values of the shares held.

The fair values of equity securities traded on
    U.S. exchanges are derived from quoted market prices as of
    the close of business on the last business day of the year. The
    fair values of equity securities traded on foreign exchanges are
    also derived from quoted market prices as of the close of
    business on an active foreign exchange on the last business day
    of the year. However, the valuation requires translation of the
    foreign currency to U.S. dollars and this translation is
    considered an observable input to the valuation.

The fair value of all commingled investment funds has been
    estimated based on the net asset values per unit of each of the
    funds. The net asset values per unit of the fund represent the
    aggregate value of the fund’s assets less liabilities,
    divided by the number of units outstanding. Common stocks traded
    in active markets comprise the majority of each commingled
    investment fund’s assets. The fair value of these common
    stocks is derived from quoted market prices as of the close of
    business on the last business day of the year.

The fair value of fixed income securities, except
    U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, are determined using pricing
    models. These pricing models incorporate observable inputs such
    as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and
    issuer spreads for similar securities to determine fair value.
    The U.S. Treasury notes and bonds are valued at fair value
    based on closing prices on the last business day of the year
    reported in the active market in which the security is traded.

The investment contracts with insurance companies are valued at
    fair value by discounting the cash flow of a bond using a yield
    to maturity based on an investment grade index or comparable
    index with a similar maturity value, maturity period, and
    nominal coupon rate.

Plan
    Benefit Payments and Employer Contributions

Following are the expected benefits to be paid by the plans and
    the expected federal prescription drug subsidy to be received in
    the next ten years. These estimates are based on the same
    assumptions previously discussed and reflect future service as
    appropriate. The actuarial assumptions are based on long-term
    expectations and include, but are not limited to, assumptions as
    to average expected retirement age and form of benefit payment.
    Actual benefit payments could differ significantly from expected
    benefit payments if near-term participant behaviors differ
    significantly from the actuarial assumptions.

    after-tax basis in accordance with the plans’ guidelines.
    We match employees’ contributions up to certain limits. Our
    matching contributions charged to expense were $26 million
    in 2010, $25 million in 2009, and $24 million in 2008.
    Certain accounts within one of our defined contribution plans
    have a nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP)
    component. The shares held by the ESOP are treated as
    outstanding when computing earnings per share and the dividends
    on the shares held by the ESOP are recorded as a component of
    retained earnings. There were no contributions in 2010, 2009,
    and 2008 to this ESOP, other than dividend reinvestment, as
    contributions for purchase of our stock are no longer allowed
    within this defined contribution plan.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On December 21, 2010, we completed the acquisition of
    100 percent of the equity of Dakota-3 E&P Company LLC
    for $949 million, including closing adjustments. This
    company holds approximately 85,800 net acres on the
    Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in the Williston basin of
    North Dakota. Approximately 85 percent of this acreage is
    undeveloped. This acquisition establishes us in the Bakken Shale
    oil play and further diversifies our commodity profile.
    Substantially all of the purchase price was recorded as oil and
    gas properties within property, plant and equipment by
    Exploration & Production. Revenues and earnings for
    the acquired company are insignificant for the three years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

expense for

property, plant, and equipment — net

was
    $1.5 billion in 2010, $1.5 billion in 2009, and
    $1.3 billion in 2008. Oil and gas accounting guidance
    requires we value our reserves using an average price. This
    price is calculated using prices at the beginning of the month
    for the preceding 12 months. This accounting guidance was
    adopted on a prospective basis in fourth quarter 2009.
    Adjustments resulting from the implementation of this guidance
    have not had a material impact on our financial statements.

Regulated

property, plant, and equipment — net

includes $906 million and $946 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to
    amounts in excess of the original cost of the regulated
    facilities within our gas pipeline businesses as a result of our
    prior acquisitions. This amount is being amortized over
    40 years using the straight-line amortization method.
    Current FERC policy does not permit recovery through rates for
    amounts in excess of original cost of construction.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

Our accrued obligations relate to producing wells, underground
    storage caverns, offshore platforms, fractionation facilities,
    gas gathering well connections and pipelines, and gas
    transmission facilities. At the end of the useful life of each
    respective asset, we are legally obligated to plug both
    producing wells and storage caverns and remove any related
    surface equipment, to restore land and remove surface equipment
    at fractionation facilities, to dismantle offshore platforms, to
    cap certain gathering pipelines at the wellhead connection and
    remove any related surface equipment, and to remove certain
    components of gas transmission facilities from the ground.

    abandonment on certain of Transco’s natural gas storage
    caverns that were associated with a recent leak.

Pursuant to its 2008 rate case settlement, Transco deposits a
    portion of its collected rates into an external trust (ARO

The current availability of named windstorm insurance has been
    significantly reduced from historical levels. Additionally,
    named windstorm insurance coverage that is available for
    offshore assets comes at significantly higher premium amounts,

    coverage for physical damage to facilities, especially damage to
    offshore facilities by named windstorms, is limited to
    $75 million for each occurrence and on an annual aggregate

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict
    or limit, among other things, our ability to create liens
    supporting indebtedness, sell assets, and incur additional debt.
    Default of these agreements could also restrict our ability to
    make certain distributions or repurchase equity.

Credit
    Facilities

In conjunction with our restructuring in the first quarter of
    2010, we reduced our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving
    credit facility that expires May 2012 to $900 million and
    removed Transco and Northwest Pipeline as borrowers. Interest is
    calculated based on a choice of two methods: a fluctuating rate
    equal to the lender’s base rate plus an applicable margin,
    or a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable
    margin. We are required to pay a commitment fee (currently
    0.125 percent) based on the unused portion of the credit
    facility. The margins and commitment fee are generally based on
    our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. Significant
    financial covenants under the credit agreement include the
    following:

•

Our consolidated ratio of debt to capitalization must be no
    greater than 65 percent. At December 31, 2010, we are
    in compliance with this covenant.

In October 2010, unsecured credit facilities totaling
    $700 million expired and were not renewed. These facilities
    were originated primarily in support of our former power
    business.

As part of our strategic restructuring, WPZ entered into a new
    $1.75 billion three-year senior unsecured revolving credit
    facility with Transco and Northwest Pipeline as co-borrowers.
    This credit facility replaced an unsecured $450 million
    credit facility, comprised of a $200 million revolving
    credit facility and a $250 million term loan which was
    terminated as part of the restructuring. At the closing, WPZ
    utilized $250 million of the credit facility to repay the
    outstanding term loan. During 2010, WPZ had a maximum of
    $430 million outstanding under this credit facility, which
    was primarily used to purchase an additional ownership interest
    in Overland Pass Pipeline Company LLC (OPPL). At
    December 31, 2010, the outstanding balance under the credit
    facility was reduced to zero.

The credit facility may, under certain conditions, be increased
    by up to an additional $250 million. The full amount of the
    credit facility is available to WPZ to the extent not otherwise
    utilized by Transco and Northwest Pipeline. Transco and
    Northwest Pipeline each have access to borrow up to
    $400 million under the credit facility to the extent not
    otherwise utilized by other co-borrowers. Each time funds are
    borrowed, the borrower may choose from two methods of
    calculating interest: a fluctuating base rate equal to Citibank
    N.A’s adjusted base rate plus an applicable margin, or a
    periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
    WPZ is required to pay a commitment fee (currently
    0.5 percent) based on the unused portion of the credit
    facility. The applicable margin and the commitment fee are based
    on the specific borrower’s senior unsecured long-term debt
    ratings. The credit facility contains various covenants that
    limit, among other things, a borrower’s and its respective
    subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, grant certain
    liens supporting indebtedness, merge or consolidate, sell all or
    substantially all of its assets, enter into certain affiliate
    transactions, make certain distributions during an event of
    default, and allow any material change in the nature of its
    business. Significant financial covenants under the credit
    facility include:

•

WPZ ratio of debt to EBITDA (each as defined in the credit
    facility, with EBITDA measured on a rolling four-quarter basis)
    must be no greater than 5 to 1.

•

The ratio of debt to capitalization (defined as net worth plus
    debt) must be no greater than 55 percent for Transco and
    Northwest Pipeline.

Each of the above ratios are tested at the end of each fiscal
    quarter (with the first full year measured on an annualized
    basis). At December 31, 2010, we are in compliance with
    these financial covenants.

The credit facility includes customary events of default. If an
    event of default with respect to a borrower occurs under the
    credit facility, the lenders will be able to terminate the
    commitments for all borrowers and accelerate the maturity of any
    loans of the defaulting borrower under the credit facility and
    exercise other rights and remedies.

Exploration &
    Production’s Credit Agreement

Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks in order to reduce margin
    requirements related to our hedging activities as well as lower
    transaction fees. In July 2010, the term of this facility
    expiring in December 2013 was extended to December 2015. Under
    the credit agreement, Exploration & Production is not
    required to post collateral as long as the value of its domestic
    natural gas reserves, as determined under the provisions of the
    agreement, exceeds by a specified amount certain of its
    obligations including any outstanding debt and the aggregate

out-of-the-money

positions on hedges entered into under the credit agreement.
    Exploration & Production is subject to additional
    covenants under the credit agreement including restrictions on
    hedge limits, the creation of liens, the incurrence of debt, the
    sale of assets and properties, and making certain payments
    during an event of default, such as dividends. In December 2010,
    a waiver with the same terms and restrictions as the original
    agreement, was executed that will allow us to also hedge up to a
    certain volume of oil.

Stockholders’
    Equity

Cash dividends declared per our common share were $.485, $.44
    and $.43 for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

In July 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
    of up to $1 billion of our common stock. During 2007, we
    purchased 16 million shares for $526 million
    (including transaction costs) at an average cost of $33.08 per
    share. During 2008, we purchased 13 million shares of our
    common stock for $474 million (including transaction costs)
    at an average cost of $36.76 per share. We completed our
    $1 billion stock repurchase program in July 2008. Our
    overall average cost per share was $34.74. This stock repurchase
    is recorded in

treasury stock

on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet.

At December 31, 2010, approximately $22 million of our
    original $300 million, 5.5 percent junior subordinated
    convertible debentures, convertible into approximately two
    million shares of common stock, remain outstanding. In 2009 and
    2008, we converted $28 million and $27 million,
    respectively, of the debentures in exchange for three million
    and two million shares, respectively, of common stock.

At December 31, 2007, we held all of WPZ’s seven
    million subordinated units outstanding. In February 2008, these
    subordinated units were converted into common units of WPZ due
    to the achievement of certain financial targets that resulted in
    the early termination of the subordination period. While these
    subordinated units were outstanding, other issuances of
    partnership units by WPZ had preferential rights and the
    proceeds from these issuances in excess of the book basis of
    assets acquired by WPZ were therefore reflected as

noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries

on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the conversion of the
    subordinated units, these original issuances of partnership
    units no longer have preferential rights and now represent the
    lowest level of equity securities issued by WPZ. In accordance
    with our policy in effect at that time regarding the issuance of
    equity of a consolidated subsidiary, such issuances of
    nonpreferential equity are accounted for as capital transactions
    and no gain or loss is recognized. Therefore, as a result of the
    2008 conversion, we recognized a decrease to

noncontrolling
    interests in consolidated subsidiaries

and a corresponding
    increase to

capital in excess of par value

of
    approximately $1.2 billion.

We maintain a Stockholder Rights Plan, as amended and restated
    on September 21, 2004, and further amended May 18,
    2007, and October 12, 2007, under which each outstanding
    share of our common stock has a right (as defined in the plan)
    attached. Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised
    to purchase, at an exercise price of $50 (subject to
    adjustment), one two-hundredth of a share of Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The rights may be
    exercised only if an Acquiring Person acquires (or obtains the
    right to acquire) 15 percent or more of our common stock or
    commences an offer for 15 percent or more of our common
    stock. The plan contains a mechanism to divest of shares of
    common stock if such stock in excess of 14.9 percent was
    acquired inadvertently or without knowledge of the terms of the
    rights. The rights, which until exercised do not have voting
    rights, expire in 2014 and may be redeemed at a price of $.01
    per right prior to their expiration, or within a specified
    period of time after the occurrence of certain events. In the
    event a person becomes the owner of more than 15 percent of
    our common stock, each holder of a right (except an Acquiring
    Person) shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, our
    common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise
    price of the right. In the event we are engaged in a merger,
    business combination, or 50 percent or more of our assets,
    cash flow or earnings power is sold or transferred, each holder
    of a right (except an Acquiring Person) shall have the right to
    receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company
    having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the
    right.

On May 17, 2007, our stockholders approved a plan that
    provides common-stock-based awards to both employees and

    for issuance. On May 20, 2010, our stockholders approved an
    amendment and restatement of the 2007 plan to increase by
    11 million the number of new



THE

shares authorized for making awards under the plan, among other
    changes. The plan permits the granting of various types of
    awards including, but not limited to, restricted stock units and
    stock options. At December 31, 2010, 39 million shares
    of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to
    existing and future stock awards, of which 19 million
    shares were available for future grants. At December 31,
    2009, 30 million shares of our common stock were reserved
    for issuance pursuant to existing and future stock awards, of
    which 11 million shares were available for future grants.

Additionally, on May 17, 2007, our stockholders approved an
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) which authorizes up to
    2 million new shares of our common stock to be available
    for sale under the plan. The ESPP enables eligible participants
    to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions not
    exceeding an annual amount of $15,000 per participant. The ESPP
    provides for offering periods during which shares may be
    purchased and continues until the earliest of: (1) the
    Board of Directors terminates the ESPP, (2) the sale of all
    shares available under the ESPP, or (3) the tenth
    anniversary of the date the Plan was approved by the
    stockholders. The first offering under the ESPP commenced on
    October 1, 2007 and ended on December 31, 2007.
    Subsequent offering periods are from January through June and
    from July through December. Generally, all employees are
    eligible to participate in the ESPP, with the exception of
    executives and international employees. The number of shares
    eligible for an employee to purchase during each offering period
    is limited to 750 shares. The purchase price of the stock
    is 85 percent of the lower closing price of either the
    first or the last day of the offering period. The ESPP requires
    a one-year holding period before the stock can be sold.
    Employees purchased 301 thousand shares at an average price of
    $15.36 per share during 2010. Approximately 1.0 million and
    1.3 million shares were available for purchase under the
    ESPP at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $48 million,
    $43 million, and $31 million, respectively. Measured
    but unrecognized stock-based compensation expense at
    December 31, 2010, was $46 million, which does not
    include the effect of estimated forfeitures of $2 million.
    This amount is comprised of $5 million related to stock
    options and $41 million related to restricted stock units.
    These amounts are expected to be recognized over a

Fair
    Value Measurements

Fair value is the amount received to sell an asset or the amount
    paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants (an exit price) at the measurement date.
    Fair value is a market-based measurement considered from the
    perspective of a market participant. We use market data or
    assumptions that we believe market participants would use in
    pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk
    and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation. These
    inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or
    unobservable. We apply both market and income approaches for
    recurring fair value measurements using the best available
    information while utilizing valuation techniques that maximize
    the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs.

The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure
    fair value, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
    measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
    (Level 3 measurement). We classify fair value balances
    based on the observability of those inputs. The three levels of
    the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices for identical assets or
    liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to
    access. Active markets are those in which transactions for the
    asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to
    provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Our
    Level 1 measurements primarily consist of financial
    instruments that are exchange traded.

•

Level 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices in
    active markets included in Level 1, that are either
    directly or indirectly observable. These inputs are either
    directly observable in the marketplace or indirectly observable
    through corroboration with market data for substantially the
    full contractual term of the asset or liability being measured.
    Our Level 2 measurements primarily consist of

over-the-counter

(OTC) instruments such as forwards, swaps, and options.

•

Level 3 — Inputs that are not observable or for
    which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or
    liability being measured. These inputs reflect management’s
    best estimate of the assumptions market participants would use
    in determining fair value. Our Level 3 measurements consist
    of instruments that are valued utilizing unobservable pricing
    inputs that are significant to the overall fair value.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In valuing certain contracts, the inputs used to measure fair
    value may fall into different levels of the fair value
    hierarchy. For disclosure purposes, assets and liabilities are
    classified in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy level
    based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    overall fair value measurement. Our assessment of the
    significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
    requires judgment and may affect the placement within the fair
    value hierarchy levels.

The following table presents, by level within the fair value
    hierarchy, our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
    value on a recurring basis.

Energy derivatives include commodity based exchange-traded
    contracts and OTC contracts. Exchange-traded contracts include
    futures, swaps, and options. OTC contracts include forwards,
    swaps and options.

Many contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in
    the market. Our policy is to use a mid-market pricing (the
    mid-point price between bid and ask prices) convention to value
    individual positions and then adjust on a portfolio level to a
    point within the bid and ask range that represents our best
    estimate of fair value. For offsetting positions by location,
    the mid-market price is used to measure both the long and short
    positions.

The determination of fair value for our energy derivative assets
    and liabilities also incorporates the time value of money and
    various credit risk factors which can include the credit
    standing of the counterparties involved, master netting
    arrangements, the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash
    collateral posted and letters of credit) and our nonperformance
    risk on our liabilities. The determination of the fair value of
    our liabilities does not consider noncash collateral credit
    enhancements.

Exchange-traded contracts include New York Mercantile Exchange
    and Intercontinental Exchange contracts and are valued based on
    quoted prices in these active markets and are classified within
    Level 1.

Forward, swap, and option contracts included in Level 2 are
    valued using an income approach including present value
    techniques and option pricing models. Option contracts, which
    hedge future sales of production from our
    Exploration & Production segment, are structured as
    costless collars and are financially settled. They are valued
    using an industry standard Black-Scholes option pricing model.
    Significant inputs into our Level 2 valuations include
    commodity prices, implied volatility by location, and interest
    rates, as well as considering executed transactions or broker
    quotes corroborated by other market data. These broker quotes
    are based on observable market prices at which transactions
    could currently be executed. In certain instances where these
    inputs are not observable for all periods, relationships of
    observable market data and historical observations are used as a
    means to estimate fair value. Where observable inputs are
    available for substantially the full term of the asset or
    liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2.

Our energy derivatives portfolio is largely comprised of
    exchange-traded products or like products and the tenure of our
    derivatives portfolio is relatively short with more than
    99 percent of the value of our derivatives

portfolio expiring in the next 24 months. Due to the nature
    of the products and tenure, we are consistently able to obtain
    market pricing. All pricing is reviewed on a daily basis and is
    formally validated with broker quotes and documented on a
    monthly basis.

Certain instruments trade with lower availability of pricing
    information. These instruments are valued with a present value
    technique using inputs that may not be readily observable or
    corroborated by other market data. These instruments are
    classified within Level 3 when these inputs have a
    significant impact on the measurement of fair value. The
    instruments included in Level 3 at December 31, 2010,
    consist primarily of natural gas index transactions that are
    used to manage the physical requirements of our
    Exploration & Production segment.

Reclassifications of fair value between Level 1,
    Level 2, and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, if
    applicable, are made at the end of each quarter. No significant
    transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 occurred
    during the year ended December 31, 2010. In 2009, certain
    Exploration & Production options which hedge future
    sales of production were transferred from Level 3 to
    Level 2. These options were originally included in
    Level 3 because a significant input to the model, implied
    volatility by location, was considered unobservable. Due to
    increased transparency, this input was considered observable,
    and we transferred these options to Level 2.

The following tables present a reconciliation of changes in the
    fair value of our net energy derivatives and other assets
    classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

(a)

Due to a significant decline in forward natural gas prices
    across all future production periods as of September 30,
    2010, we performed an interim impairment assessment of the
    approximate $1 billion of goodwill at
    Exploration & Production related to its domestic
    natural gas production operations (the reporting unit). Forward
    natural gas prices through 2025 as of September 30, 2010,
    used in our analysis declined more than 22 percent on
    average compared to the forward prices as of December 31,
    2009. We estimated the fair value of the reporting unit on a
    stand-alone basis by valuing proved and unproved reserves, as
    well as estimating the fair values of other assets and
    liabilities which are identified to the reporting unit. We used
    an income approach (discounted cash flow) for valuing reserves.
    The significant inputs into the valuation of proved and unproved
    reserves included reserve quantities, forward natural gas
    prices, anticipated drilling and operating costs, anticipated
    production curves, income taxes, and appropriate discount rates.
    To estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and the implied
    fair value of goodwill under a hypothetical acquisition of the
    reporting unit, we assumed a tax structure where a buyer would
    obtain a

step-up

in
    the tax basis of the net assets acquired. Significant
    assumptions in valuing proved reserves included reserves
    quantities of more than 4.4 trillion cubic feet of gas
    equivalent; forward prices averaging approximately $4.65 per
    thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent (Mcfe) for natural gas
    (adjusted for locational differences), natural gas liquids and
    oil; and an after-tax discount rate of 11 percent. Unproved
    reserves (probable and possible) were valued using similar
    assumptions adjusted further for the uncertainty associated with
    these reserves by using after- tax discount rates of
    13 percent and 15 percent, respectively, commensurate
    with our estimate of the risk of those reserves. In our
    assessment as of September 30, 2010, the carrying value of
    the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded its estimated
    fair value. We then determined that the implied fair value of
    the goodwill was zero. As a result of our analysis, we
    recognized a full $1 billion impairment charge related to
    this goodwill.

(b)

As of September 30, 2010, we assessed the carrying value of
    Exploration & Production’s natural gas-producing
    properties and costs of acquired unproved reserves, for
    impairments as a result of recent significant declines in
    forward natural gas prices. Our assessment utilized estimates of
    future cash flows. Significant judgments and assumptions in
    these assessments are similar to those used in the goodwill
    evaluation and include estimates of natural gas reserve
    quantities, estimates of future natural gas prices using a
    forward NYMEX curve adjusted for locational basis differentials,
    drilling plans, expected capital costs, and an applicable
    discount rate commensurate with risk of the underlying cash flow
    estimates. The assessment performed at September 30, 2010,
    identified certain properties with a carrying value in excess of
    their calculated fair values. As a result, we

Fair-value
    methods

We use the following methods and assumptions in estimating our
    fair-value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted
    cash

:  The carrying amounts reported in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value due to the
    short-term maturity of these instruments. Current and noncurrent
    restricted cash is included in

other current assets and
    deferred charges

and

other assets and deferred
    charges

, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

ARO Trust Investments:

Transco deposits a
    portion of its collected rates, pursuant to its 2008 rate case
    settlement, into an external trust specifically designated to
    fund future asset retirement obligations (ARO Trust). The ARO
    Trust invests in a portfolio of mutual funds that are reported
    at fair value in

other assets and deferred charges

in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet and are classified as

available-for-sale.

However, both realized and unrealized gains and losses are
    ultimately recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities.

Long-term debt

:  The fair value of our publicly
    traded long-term debt is determined using indicative year-end
    traded bond market prices. Private debt is valued based on
    market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar
    terms and credit ratings. At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    approximately 100 percent and 97 percent,
    respectively, of our long-term debt was publicly traded. (See
    Note 11.)

Guarantees

:  The

guarantees

represented
    in the following table consist of a guarantee we have provided
    in the event of nonpayment by our previously owned
    communications subsidiary, Williams Communications Group
    (WilTel), on a certain lease performance obligation. To estimate
    the fair value of the guarantee, the estimated default

Energy
    Commodity Derivatives

Risk
    management activities

We are exposed to market risk from changes in energy commodity
    prices within our operations. We manage this risk on an
    enterprise basis and may utilize derivatives to manage our
    exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows from
    forecasted purchases and sales of natural gas and NGLs
    attributable to commodity price risk. Certain of these
    derivatives utilized for risk management purposes have been
    designated as cash flow hedges, while other derivatives have not
    been designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge
    accounting despite hedging our future cash flows on an economic
    basis.

We produce, buy, and sell natural gas at different locations
    throughout the United States. We also enter into forward
    contracts to buy and sell natural gas to maximize the economic
    value of transportation agreements and storage capacity
    agreements. To reduce exposure to a decrease in revenues or
    margins from fluctuations in natural gas market prices, we enter
    into natural gas futures contracts, swap agreements, and
    financial option contracts to mitigate the price risk on
    forecasted sales of natural gas. We have also entered into basis
    swap agreements to reduce the locational price risk associated
    with our producing basins. These cash flow hedges are expected
    to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to
    the hedged risk during the term of the hedge. However,
    ineffectiveness may be recognized primarily as a result of
    locational differences between the hedging derivative and the



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

hedged item. Our financial option contracts are either purchased
    options or a combination of options that comprise a net
    purchased option or a zero-cost collar. Our designation of the
    hedging relationship and method of assessing effectiveness for
    these option contracts are generally such that the hedging
    relationship is considered perfectly effective and no
    ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings. Hedges for storage
    contracts have not been designated as cash flow hedges, despite
    economically hedging the expected cash flows generated by those
    agreements.

We produce and sell NGLs and olefins at different locations
    throughout North America. We also buy natural gas to satisfy the
    required fuel and shrink needed to generate NGLs and olefins. To
    reduce exposure to a decrease in revenues from fluctuations in
    NGL market prices or increases in costs and operating expenses
    from fluctuations in natural gas and NGL market prices, we may
    enter into NGL or natural gas swap agreements, financial forward
    contracts, and financial option contracts to mitigate the price
    risk on forecasted sales of NGLs and purchases of natural gas
    and NGLs. These cash flow hedges are expected to be highly
    effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged
    risk during the term of the hedge. However, ineffectiveness may
    be recognized primarily as a result of locational differences
    between the hedging derivative and the hedged item.

Other
    activities

We also enter into energy commodity derivatives for other than
    risk management purposes, including managing certain remaining
    legacy natural gas contracts and positions from our former power
    business and providing services to third parties. These legacy
    natural gas contracts include substantially offsetting positions
    and have an insignificant net impact on earnings.

Volumes

Our energy commodity derivatives are comprised of both contracts
    to purchase the commodity (long positions) and contracts to sell
    the commodity (short positions). Derivative transactions are
    categorized into four types:

•

Central hub risk:  Includes physical and financial
    derivative exposures to Henry Hub for natural gas, West Texas
    Intermediate for crude oil, and Mont Belvieu for NGLs;

•

Basis risk:  Includes physical and financial
    derivative exposures to the difference in value between the
    central hub and another specific delivery point;

•

Index risk:  Includes physical derivative exposure at
    an unknown future price;

•

Options:  Includes all fixed price options or
    combination of options (collars) that set a floor

and/or

ceiling for the transaction price of a commodity.

Fixed price swaps at locations other than the central hub are
    classified as both central hub risk and basis risk instruments
    to represent their exposure to overall market conditions
    (central hub risk) and specific location risk (basis risk).

The following table depicts the notional quantities of the net
    long (short) positions in our commodity derivatives portfolio as
    of December 31, 2010. Natural gas is presented in millions
    of British Thermal Units (MMBtu), and NGLs are presented in
    gallons. The volumes for options represent at location zero-cost
    collars and present one side of the short position. The net

    in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as

changes in
    current and noncurrent derivative assets and liabilities

.

Credit-risk-related
    features

Certain of our derivative contracts contain credit-risk-related
    provisions that would require us, in certain circumstances, to
    post additional collateral in support of our net derivative
    liability positions. These credit-risk-related provisions
    require us to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of
    credit when our net liability positions exceed an established
    credit threshold. The credit thresholds are typically based on
    our senior unsecured debt ratings from Standard and Poor’s

and/or

Moody’s Investors Service. Under these contracts, a credit
    ratings decline would lower our credit thresholds, thus
    requiring us to post additional collateral. We also have
    contracts that contain adequate assurance provisions giving the
    counterparty the right to request collateral in an amount that
    corresponds to the outstanding net liability. Additionally,
    Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks related to hedging activities. We
    are not required to provide collateral support for net
    derivative liability positions under the credit agreement as
    long as the value of Exploration & Production’s
    domestic natural gas reserves, as determined under the
    provisions of the agreement, exceeds by a specified amount
    certain of its obligations including any outstanding debt and
    the aggregate

out-of-the-money

position on hedges entered into under the credit agreement.

As of December 31, 2010, we have collateral totaling
    $8 million, all of which is in the form of letters of
    credit, posted to derivative counterparties to support the
    aggregate fair value of our net derivative liability position
    (reflecting master netting arrangements in place with certain
    counterparties) of $36 million, which includes a reduction
    of less than $1 million to our liability balance for our
    own nonperformance risk. At December 31, 2009, we had
    collateral totaling $96 million posted to derivative
    counterparties, all of which was in the form of letters of
    credit, to support the aggregate fair value of our net
    derivative liability position (reflecting master netting
    arrangements in place with certain counterparties) of
    $167 million, which included a reduction of $3 million
    to our liability balance for our own nonperformance risk. The
    additional collateral that we would have been required to post,
    assuming our credit thresholds were eliminated and a call for
    adequate assurance under the credit risk provisions in our
    derivative contracts was triggered, was $29 million and
    $74 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31,
    2009, respectively.

Cash flow
    hedges

Changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges, to the extent
    effective, are deferred in AOCI and reclassified into earnings
    in the same period or periods in which the hedged forecasted
    purchases or sales affect earnings, or when it is probable that
    the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of
    the originally specified time period. As of December 31,
    2010, we have hedged portions of future cash flows associated
    with anticipated energy commodity purchases and sales for up to
    two years. Based on recorded values at December 31, 2010,
    $148 million of net gains (net of income tax provision of
    $88 million) will be reclassified into earnings within the
    next year. These recorded values are based on market prices of
    the commodities as of December 31, 2010. Due to the
    volatile nature of commodity prices and changes in the
    creditworthiness of counterparties, actual gains or losses
    realized within the next year will likely differ from these
    values. These gains or losses are expected to substantially
    offset net losses or gains that will be realized in earnings
    from previous unfavorable or favorable market movements
    associated with underlying hedged transactions.

Guarantees

In addition to the guarantees and payment obligations discussed
    in Note 16, we have issued guarantees and other similar
    arrangements as discussed below.

We are required by our revolving credit agreements to indemnify
    lenders for any taxes required to be withheld from payments due
    to the lenders and for any tax payments made by the lenders. The
    maximum potential amount of



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

future payments under these indemnifications is based on the
    related borrowings and such future payments cannot currently be
    determined. These indemnifications generally continue
    indefinitely unless limited by the underlying tax regulations
    and have no carrying value. We have never been called upon to
    perform under these indemnifications and have no current
    expectation of a future claim.

We have provided a guarantee in the event of nonpayment by our
    previously owned communications subsidiary, WilTel, on a certain
    lease performance obligation that extends through 2042. The
    maximum potential exposure is approximately $39 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $40 million at December 31,
    2009. Our exposure declines systematically throughout the
    remaining term of WilTel’s obligation. The carrying value
    of the guarantee included in

accrued liabilities

on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet is $35 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $36 million at December 31,
    2009.

At December 31, 2010, we do not expect these guarantees to
    have a material impact on our future liquidity or financial
    position. However, if we are required to perform on these
    guarantees in the future, it may have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations.

Natural gas customers include pipelines, distribution companies,
    producers, gas marketers and industrial users primarily located
    in the eastern and northwestern United States, Rocky Mountains,
    Gulf Coast, and Canada. As a general policy, collateral is not
    required for receivables, but customers’ financial
    condition and credit worthiness are evaluated regularly.

Derivative
    assets and liabilities

We have a risk of loss from counterparties not performing
    pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.
    Counterparty performance can be influenced by changes in the
    economy and regulatory issues, among other factors. Risk of loss
    is impacted by several factors, including credit considerations
    and the regulatory environment in which a counterparty
    transacts. We attempt to minimize credit-risk exposure to
    derivative counterparties and brokers through formal credit
    policies, consideration of credit ratings from public ratings
    agencies, monitoring procedures, master netting agreements and
    collateral support under certain circumstances. Collateral
    support could include

(a)

We determine investment grade primarily using publicly available
    credit ratings. We include counterparties with a minimum
    Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB- or Moody’s
    Investors Service rating of Baa3 in investment grade.

Our nine largest net counterparty positions represent
    approximately 99 percent of our net credit exposure from
    derivatives and are all with investment grade counterparties.
    Included within this group are eight counterparty positions,
    representing 81 percent of our net credit exposure from
    derivatives, associated with Exploration &
    Production’s hedging facility. Under certain conditions,
    the terms of this credit agreement may require the participating
    financial institutions to deliver collateral support to a
    designated collateral agent (which is another participating
    financial institution in the agreement). The level of collateral
    support required is dependent on whether the net position of the
    counterparty financial institution exceeds specified thresholds.
    The thresholds may be subject to prescribed reductions based on
    changes in the credit rating of the counterparty financial
    institution.

At December 31, 2010, the designated collateral agent holds
    $19 million of collateral support on our behalf under
    Exploration & Production’s hedging facility. In
    addition, we hold collateral support, which may include cash or
    letters of credit, of $15 million related to our other
    derivative positions.

Revenues

In 2010 we had one customer in our Williams Partners segment
    that accounted for 10 percent of our consolidated revenues.
    In 2009, and 2008, there were no customers for which our sales
    exceeded 10 percent of our consolidated revenues.

Contingent

Issues
    Resulting from California Energy Crisis

Our former power business was engaged in power marketing in
    various geographic areas, including California. Prices charged
    for power by us and other traders and generators in California
    and other western states in 2000 and 2001 were challenged in
    various proceedings, including those before the FERC. We have
    entered into settlements with the State of California (State
    Settlement), major California utilities (Utilities Settlement),
    and others that substantially resolved each of these issues with
    these parties.

Although the State Settlement and Utilities Settlement resolved
    a significant portion of the refund issues among the settling
    parties, we continue to have potential refund exposure to
    nonsettling parties, including various California end users that
    did not participate in the Utilities Settlement. We are
    currently in settlement negotiations with certain California
    utilities aimed at eliminating or substantially reducing this
    exposure. If successful, and subject to a final

“true-up”

mechanism, the settlement agreement would also resolve our
    collection of accrued interest from counterparties as well as
    our payment of accrued interest on refund amounts. Thus, as
    currently contemplated by the parties, the settlement agreement
    would resolve most, if not all, of our legal issues arising from
    the

2000-2001

California Energy Crisis.

As a result of a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision, certain
    contracts that we entered into during 2000 and 2001 might have
    been subject to partial refunds depending on the results of
    further proceedings at the FERC. These contracts, under which we
    sold electricity, totaled approximately $89 million in
    revenue. While we were not a party to the cases involved in the
    U.S. Supreme Court decision, the buyer of electricity from
    us is a party to the cases and claimed that we must refund to
    the buyer any loss it suffers due to the FERC’s
    reconsideration of the contract terms at issue in the decision.
    In August 2010, the FERC ruled that settlement of the separate
    claims against the buyer required the dismissal of the
    buyer’s claims against us.

Certain other issues also remain open at the FERC and for other
    nonsettling parties.

Reporting
    of Natural Gas-Related Information to Trade
    Publications

Civil suits based on allegations of manipulating published gas
    price indices have been brought against us and others, in each
    case seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are currently
    a defendant in class action litigation and other litigation
    originally filed in state court in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri
    and Wisconsin brought on behalf of direct and indirect
    purchasers of gas in those states.

•

The federal court in Nevada currently presides over cases that
    were transferred to it from state courts in Colorado, Kansas,
    Missouri, and Wisconsin. In 2008, the federal court in Nevada
    granted summary judgment in the Colorado case in favor of us and
    most of the other defendants, and on January 8, 2009, the
    court denied the plaintiffs’ request for reconsideration of
    the Colorado dismissal. We expect that the Colorado plaintiffs
    will appeal, but the appeal cannot occur until the case against
    the remaining defendant is concluded. In the other cases, our
    joint motions for summary judgment to preclude the
    plaintiffs’ state law claims based upon federal preemption
    have been pending since late 2009. If the motions are granted,
    we expect a final judgment in our favor which the plaintiffs
    could appeal. If the motions are denied, the current stay of
    activity would be lifted, class certification would be
    addressed, and discovery would be completed as the cases
    proceeded towards trial. Additionally, we would be unable to
    estimate a revised range of exposure until certain of these
    matters were resolved. However, it would be reasonably possible
    that such a range could include levels that would be material to
    our results of operations.

•

On April 23, 2010, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the
    state appellate court and dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims
    against us on federal preemption grounds. The plaintiffs did not
    appeal this ruling to the United States Supreme Court. This case
    is now concluded in our favor.

On September 24, 2010, the Missouri Supreme Court declined
    to hear the plaintiff’s appeal of the trial court’s
    dismissal of a case for lack of standing. The case is now
    concluded in our favor.

Environmental
    Matters

Continuing
    operations

Our interstate gas pipelines are involved in remediation
    activities related to certain facilities and locations for
    polychlorinated biphenyl, mercury contamination, and other
    hazardous substances. These activities have involved the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various
    state environmental authorities. At December 31, 2010 we
    have accrued liabilities of $12 million for these costs. We
    expect that these costs will be recoverable through rates.

We also accrue environmental remediation costs for natural gas
    underground storage facilities, primarily related to soil and
    groundwater contamination. At December 31, 2010, we have
    accrued liabilities totaling $6 million for these costs.

In March 2008, the EPA proposed a penalty of $370,000 for
    alleged violations relating to leak detection and repair program
    delays at our Ignacio gas plant in Colorado and for alleged
    permit violations at a compressor station. We met with the EPA
    and are exchanging information in order to resolve the issues.

In September 2007, the EPA requested, and our Transco subsidiary
    later provided, information regarding natural gas compressor
    stations in the states of Mississippi and Alabama as part of the
    EPA’s investigation of our compliance with the Clean Air
    Act. On March 28, 2008, the EPA issued notices of violation
    alleging violations of Clean Air Act requirements at these
    compressor stations. We met with the EPA in May 2008 and
    submitted our response denying the allegations in June 2008. In
    July 2009, the EPA requested additional information pertaining
    to these compressor stations and in August 2009, we submitted
    the requested information. On August 20, 2010, the EPA
    requested and our Transco subsidiary provided, similar
    information for a compressor station in Maryland.

Former
    operations, including operations classified as
    discontinued

We have potential obligations in connection with assets and
    businesses we no longer operate. These potential obligations
    include the indemnification of the purchasers of certain of
    these assets and businesses for environmental and other
    liabilities existing at the time the sale was consummated. Our
    responsibilities include those described below.

•

Potential indemnification obligations to purchasers of our
    former agricultural fertilizer and chemical operations and
    former retail petroleum and refining operations;

•

Former petroleum products and natural gas pipelines;

•

Discontinued petroleum refining facilities;

•

Former exploration and production and mining operations.

At December 31, 2010, we have accrued environmental
    liabilities of $31 million related to these matters.

Actual costs for these matters could be substantially greater
    than amounts accrued depending on the actual number of
    contaminated sites identified, the actual amount and extent of
    contamination discovered, the final cleanup standards mandated
    by the EPA and other governmental authorities. Any incremental
    amount cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Certain of our subsidiaries have been identified as potentially
    responsible parties at various Superfund and state waste
    disposal sites. In addition, these subsidiaries have incurred,
    or are alleged to have incurred, various other hazardous
    materials removal or remediation obligations under environmental
    laws.

Environmental
    matters — general

The EPA and various state regulatory agencies routinely
    promulgate and propose new rules, and issue updated guidance to
    existing rules. These new rules and rulemakings include, but are
    not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion
    engine maximum achievable control technology, new air quality
    standards for ground level ozone, and one hour nitrogen dioxide
    emission limits. We are unable to estimate the costs of asset
    additions or modifications necessary to comply with these new
    regulations due to uncertainty created by the various legal
    challenges to these regulations and the need for further
    specific regulatory guidance.

Other
    Legal Matters

Gulf
    Liquids litigation

Gulf Liquids contracted with Gulsby Engineering Inc. (Gulsby)
    and Gulsby-Bay (a joint venture between Gulsby and Bay Ltd.) for
    the construction of certain gas processing plants in Louisiana.
    National American Insurance Company (NAICO) and American Home
    Assurance Company provided payment and performance bonds for the
    projects. In 2001, the contractors and sureties filed multiple
    cases in Louisiana and Texas against Gulf Liquids and us.

In 2006, at the conclusion of the consolidated trial of the
    asserted contract and tort claims, the jury returned its actual
    and punitive damages verdict against us and Gulf Liquids. Based
    on our interpretation of the jury verdicts, we recorded a charge
    based on our estimated exposure for actual damages of
    approximately $68 million plus potential interest of
    approximately $20 million. In addition, we concluded that
    it was reasonably possible that any ultimate judgment might have
    included additional amounts of approximately $199 million
    in excess of our accrual, which primarily represented our
    estimate of potential punitive damage exposure under Texas law.

From May through October 2007, the court entered seven
    post-trial orders in the case (interlocutory orders) which,
    among other things, overruled the verdict award of tort and
    punitive damages as well as any damages against us. The court
    also denied the plaintiffs’ claims for attorneys’
    fees. On January 28, 2008, the court issued its judgment
    awarding damages against Gulf Liquids of approximately
    $11 million in favor of Gulsby and approximately
    $4 million in favor of Gulsby-Bay. Gulf Liquids, Gulsby,
    Gulsby-Bay, Bay Ltd., and NAICO appealed the judgment. In
    February 2009, we settled with certain of these parties and
    reduced our liability as of December 31, 2008, by
    $43 million, including $11 million of interest. On
    February 17, 2011, the Texas Court of Appeals upheld the
    dismissals of the tort and punitive damages claims and reversed
    and remanded the contract claim and attorney fee claims for
    further proceedings. The appellate court ruling is subject to a
    potential appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. If the appellate
    court judgment is upheld, our remaining liability will be
    substantially less than the amount of our accrual for these
    matters.

Royalty
    litigation

In September 2006, royalty interest owners in Garfield County,
    Colorado, filed a class action suit in Colorado state court
    alleging that we improperly calculated oil and gas royalty
    payments, failed to account for the proceeds that we received
    from the sale of gas and extracted products, improperly charged
    certain expenses, and failed to refund amounts withheld in
    excess of ad valorem tax obligations. We reached a final partial
    settlement agreement for an amount that was previously accrued.
    We received a favorable ruling on our motion for summary
    judgment on one claim now on appeal by plaintiffs. We anticipate
    trial on the other remaining issue related to royalty payment
    calculation and obligations under specific lease provisions in
    2011. While we are not able to estimate the amount of any
    additional exposure at this time, it is reasonably possible that
    plaintiff’s claims could reach a material amount.

Other producers have been in litigation or discussions with a
    federal regulatory agency and a state agency in New Mexico
    regarding certain deductions used in the calculation of
    royalties. Although we are not a party to these matters, we have
    monitored them to evaluate whether their resolution might have
    the potential for unfavorable impact on our results of
    operations. One of these matters involving federal litigation
    was decided on October 5,



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2009. The resolution of this specific matter is not material to
    us. However, other related issues in these matters that could be
    material to us remain outstanding. We received notice from the
    U.S. Department of Interior Office of Natural Resources Revenue
    (ONRR) in the fourth quarter of 2010, intending to clarify the
    guidelines for calculating federal royalties on conventional gas
    production applicable to our federal leases in New Mexico. The
    ONRR’s guidance provides its view as to how much of a
    producer’s bundled fees for transportation and processing
    can be deducted from the royalty payment. Using these guidelines
    would not result in a material difference in determining our
    historical federal royalty payments for our leases in New
    Mexico. No similar specific guidance has been issued by ONRR for
    leases in other states, but such guidelines are expected in the
    future. The issuance of similar guidelines in Colorado and other
    states could affect our previous royalty payments and the effect
    could be material to our results of operations.

Other

In 2003, we entered into an agreement to sublease certain
    underground storage facilities to Liberty Gas Storage (Liberty).
    We have asserted claims against Liberty for prematurely
    terminating the sublease, and for damage caused to the
    facilities. In February 2010, Liberty subsequently indicated
    that they intend to assert a counterclaim for costs in excess of
    $200 million associated with its use of the facilities. Due
    to the lack of information currently available, we are unable to
    evaluate the merits of the potential counterclaim and determine
    the amount of any possible liability.

Other
    Divestiture Indemnifications

Pursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to
    divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain
    purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect
    to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities
    provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions
    and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities
    that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. The
    indemnities generally relate to breach of warranties, tax,
    historic litigation, personal injury, property damage,
    environmental matters, right of way and other representations
    that we have provided.

At December 31, 2010, we do not expect any of the
    indemnities provided pursuant to the sales agreements to have a
    material impact on our future financial position. However, if a
    claim for indemnity is brought against us in the future, it may
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in
    the period in which the claim is made.

In addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are
    pending against us which are incidental to our operations.

Summary

Litigation, arbitration, regulatory matters, and environmental
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties. Were an
    unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a
    material adverse impact on the results of operations in the
    period in which the ruling occurs. Management, including
    internal counsel, currently believes that the ultimate
    resolution of the foregoing matters, taken as a whole and after
    consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage, recovery
    from customers or other indemnification arrangements, will not
    have a material adverse effect upon our future liquidity or
    financial position.

Commitments for construction and acquisition of property, plant
    and equipment are approximately $226 million at

Segment
    Disclosures

Our reporting segments are Williams Partners,
    Exploration & Production, and Other. (See Note 1.)

Our segment presentation of Williams Partners is reflective of
    the parent-level focus by our chief operating decision-maker,
    considering the resource allocation and governance provisions
    associated with this master limited partnership structure. WPZ
    maintains a capital and cash management structure that is
    separate from ours. WPZ is expected to be self-funding and
    maintains its own lines of bank credit and cash management
    accounts. These factors, coupled with a different cost of
    capital from our other businesses, serve to differentiate the
    management of this entity as a whole.

Due to expected future growth in our Canadian midstream and
    domestic olefins operations, we are considering reporting these
    businesses as a separate segment in the first quarter of 2011.

Performance
    Measurement

We currently evaluate performance based upon

segment profit
    (loss)

from operations, which includes

segment revenues

from external and internal customers,

segment costs and
    expenses

,

equity earnings (losses)

and

income
    (loss) from investments

. The accounting policies of the
    segments are the same as those described in Note 1.
    Intersegment sales are generally accounted for at current market
    prices as if the sales were to unaffiliated third parties.

The primary types of costs and operating expenses by segment can
    be generally summarized as follows:

•

Williams Partners — commodity purchases (primarily for
    NGL and crude marketing, shrink and fuel), depreciation and
    operation and maintenance expenses;

•

Exploration & Production — commodity
    purchases (primarily in support of commodity marketing and risk
    management activities), depletion, depreciation and
    amortization, lease and facility operating expenses and
    operating taxes;

•

Other — commodity purchases (primarily for shrink,
    feedstock and NGL and olefin marketing activities), depreciation
    and operation and maintenance expenses.

Energy commodity hedging by our business units may be done
    through intercompany derivatives with our
    Exploration & Production segment which, in turn,
    enters into offsetting derivative contracts with unrelated third
    parties. Additionally, Exploration & Production may
    enter into transactions directly with third parties under their

Subsequent
    Events

On February 16, 2011, we announced that our Board of
    Directors approved pursuing a plan to separate the company into
    two standalone, publicly traded corporations. The plan calls for
    the separation of our exploration and production business into a
    publicly traded company via an initial public offering of up to
    20 percent of our interest in the third quarter of 2011. We
    intend to complete the offering so that it preserves our ability
    to complete a tax-free spinoff of our remaining ownership in the
    exploration and production business to Williams’
    shareholders in 2012, after which Williams would continue as a
    premier natural gas infrastructure company. We retain the
    discretion to determine whether and when to execute the spinoff.

SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES

(Unaudited)

We have significant oil and gas producing activities primarily
    in the Rocky Mountain, Northeast and Mid-continent areas of the
    United States. Additionally, we have international oil and gas
    producing activities, primarily in Argentina. Proved reserves
    and revenues related to international activities are
    approximately five percent and three percent, respectively, of
    our total international and domestic proved reserves and
    revenues from producing activities. Accordingly, the following
    information relates only to the oil and gas activities in the
    United States. This information also excludes our gas management
    activities.

Results of operations for producing activities consist of all
    related domestic oil and gas producing activities. Prior periods
    have been recast to reflect the impact of the sale of certain
    Piceance gathering and processing facilities to WPZ. Amounts for
    2010 exclude a $1 billion impairment charge related to
    goodwill associated with the purchase of Barrett Resources
    Corporation (Barrett) in 2001. Amounts for 2008 exclude a
    $148 million gain on sale of a contractual right to a
    production payment on certain future international hydrocarbon
    production.

•

Oil and gas revenues consist primarily of natural gas production
    sold and includes the impact of hedges.

•

Other revenues consist of activities that are not a direct part
    of the producing activities. Other expenses in 2009 also include
    $32 million of expense related to penalties from the early
    release of drilling rigs.

•

Production costs consist of costs incurred to operate and
    maintain wells and related equipment and facilities used in the
    production of natural gas. These costs also include production
    taxes other than income taxes, gathering, processing and
    transportation expenses (excluding charges for unutilized
    pipeline capacity), and administrative expenses in support of
    production activity. Excluded are depreciation, depletion and
    amortization of capitalized costs.

•

Exploration expenses include the costs of geological and
    geophysical activity, drilling and equipping exploratory wells
    determined to be dry holes, and the cost of retaining
    undeveloped leaseholds including lease amortization and
    impairments.



•

Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes depreciation
    of support equipment. Amounts for 2010 include $26 million
    related to corrections of prior years’ production volumes
    and costs used in the calculation of depreciation, depletion and
    amortization expense. Additionally, 2009 includes
    $17 million additional depreciation, depletion and
    amortization as a result of our recalculation of fourth quarter
    depreciation, depletion and amortization utilizing our year-end
    reserves which were lower than 2008. The lower reserves in 2009
    were primarily a result of the application of new rules issued
    by the SEC in 2009.

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves

(Rule 4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X)

as those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
    geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
    reasonable certainty to be economically producible —
    from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under
    existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government
    regulations — prior to the time at which contracts
    providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates
    that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether
    deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the
    estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have
    commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it
    will commence the project within a reasonable time. Proved
    reserves consist of two categories, proved developed reserves
    and proved undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves are
    currently producing wells and wells awaiting minor sales
    connection expenditure, recompletion, additional perforations or
    borehole stimulation treatments. Proved undeveloped reserves are
    those reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells
    on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively
    major expenditure is required for recompletion. Proved reserves
    on undrilled acreage are generally limited to those that can be
    developed within five years according to planned drilling
    activity. Proved reserves on undrilled acreage also can include
    locations that are more than one offset away from current
    producing wells where there is a reasonable certainty of
    production when drilled or where it can be demonstrated with
    reasonable certainty that there is continuity of production from
    the existing productive formation.

•

Revisions in 2010 primarily relate to the reclassification of
    reserves from proved to probable reserves attributable to
    locations not expected to be developed within five years. A
    significant portion of the revisions for 2009 are a result of
    the impact of the new SEC rules. Proved reserves are lower
    because of the lower

12-month

average,

first-of-the-month

price as compared to the 2008 year-end price, and the
    revision of proved undeveloped reserve estimates based on new
    guidance. Approximately one-half of the revisions for 2008
    relate to the impact of lower average year-end natural gas
    prices used in 2008 compared to the 2007.

•

Extensions and discoveries in 2009 are higher than other years
    due in part to the expanded definition of oil and gas reserves
    supported by reliable technology and reasonable certainty used
    for reserves estimation.

•

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.73 pounds per square
    inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil reserves are
    insignificant and have been included in the proved reserves on a
    basis of billion cubic feet equivalents (Bcfe).



Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

The following is based on the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves. In 2009, we adopted prescribed accounting revisions
    associated with oil and gas authoritative guidance. Those
    revisions include using the

12-month

average price computed as an unweighted arithmetic average of
    the price as of the first day of each month, unless prices are
    defined by contractual arrangements. These revisions are
    reflected in our 2010 and 2009 amounts. For the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the average natural gas
    equivalent price used in the estimates was $3.78 and $2.76 per
    MMcfe, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    the average year-end natural gas equivalent price used in the
    estimates was $4.41 per MMcfe. Future income tax expenses have
    been computed considering applicable taxable cash flows and
    appropriate statutory tax rates. The discount rate of
    10 percent is as prescribed by authoritative guidance.
    Continuation of year-end economic conditions also is assumed.
    The calculation is based on estimates of proved reserves, which
    are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or
    possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are
    not considered. The calculation also requires assumptions as to
    the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the
    timing and amount of future development and production costs. Of
    the $2,960 million of future development costs,
    approximately 57 percent is estimated to be spent in 2011,
    2012, and 2013.

Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating volumes and
    the value of proved reserves and in projecting future production
    rates and timing of development expenditures. Such reserve
    estimates are subject to change as additional information
    becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the
    timing of production may be substantially different from the
    reserve estimates.

In relation to the SEC rules adopted in 2009, we estimated that
    the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows in
    2009 declined approximately $840 million on a before tax
    basis and excluding the overall price rule impact. The
    significant components of this decline included an estimated
    $640 million decrease included in revisions of previous
    quantity estimates and a related $430 million decrease
    included in the net change in prices and production costs,
    partially offset by a $210 million increase included in
    extensions, discoveries and improved recovery, less estimated
    future costs. Additionally, we estimated that a significant
    portion of the remaining net change in price and production
    costs is due to the application of the new pricing rules which
    resulted in the use of lower prices at December 31, 2009,
    than would have resulted under the previous rules.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) will prevent all errors
    and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
    Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
    that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have
    been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
    that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
    breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
    Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
    acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
    management override of the control. The design of any system of
    controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about
    the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
    that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
    all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent
    limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
    due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor
    our Disclosure Controls and make modifications as necessary; our
    intent in this regard is that the Disclosure Controls will be
    modified as systems change and conditions warrant.

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
    of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the
    period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed
    under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
    these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable
    assurance level.
